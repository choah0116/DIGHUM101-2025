    "The API (Application Programming Interface) of a large language model (LLM) refers to a set of predefined functions, protocols, and tools that allow developers to interact with the model programmatically. This interface enables external applications or systems to send prompts in form of texts or texts in combination with images, if the LLM is multimodal, specify criteria for generation such as temperature and system instructions, and receive generated outputs. The API essentially provides a way to integrate the LLMâ€™s capabilities into other code.\n",

    "Google provides a dedicated [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook) with code examples for using the API. The materials that we will see here are adapted from [this notebook](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Get_started.ipynb)"
