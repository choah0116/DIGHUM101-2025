    "The API (Application Programming Interface) of a large language model (LLM) refers to a set of predefined functions, protocols, and tools that allow developers to interact with the model programmatically. This interface enables external applications or systems to send prompts in form of texts or texts in combination with images, if the LLM is multimodal, specify criteria for generation such as temperature and system instructions, and receive generated outputs. The API essentially provides a way to integrate the LLMâ€™s capabilities into other code.\n",

    "\n",
    "In lesson 4-3_api_NYT.ipynb we saw one way to safely use an API key in a Jupyter Notebook. Another way to do this is using `.env` files. This is particularly useful when you are coding in a repository where you might accidently push your API secret keys to GitHub. Or if you ever want to deploy your code, you will need to deal with `.env` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a new file in your repository called `.env` This is the entire filename. Leave it empty for now.\n",
    "- Create another file called `.gitignore`.\n",
    "  You can add anything in the `.gitignore` file that you want GitHub to not track. This will prevent you from pushing files that you don't want changed.\n",
    "- On an empty line in the  `.gitignore` file, type `.env` and push the changes.\n",
    "  This tells GitHub to ignore the `.env` file going forward.\n",
    "- Now you can save your API key to your `.env` file. Open your `.env` file and type `GEMINI_API_KEY=\"YOUR_API_KEY\"`\n",
    "- Save your `.env` file and close it. Make sure that .env file is not listed in the source control section.\n",
    "  \n",
    "API keys, other secrets as well as their management are really important skills to learn. A great place to start reading more about this topic is on this [blog post](https://dev.to/jakewitcher/using-env-files-for-environment-variables-in-python-applications-55a1). While preparing these materials, I found a new [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=josephdavidwilsonjr.api-vault), which I have not tested yet so I cannot recommend or urge against the use of it. If you want, you can take a look at it [here](https://medium.com/@dingersandks/why-every-developers-api-keys-are-probably-in-the-wrong-place-and-how-a-vs-code-extension-finally-c966d081d132). If for nothing else, this post shows why API keys are so important.\n",

    "Additionally, if you are using `Google Colab`, you can use the Colab Secrets manager to securely store your API keys.

A higher temperature (close to 1) makes the model more random and creative, producing more varied and less predictable outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **top_p**\n",
    "   is part of a technique called \"nucleus sampling.\" It means that the model will only consider the specified percentage of the probability distribution when generating the next word. In other words, it narrows down the pool of potential words to choose from, making the output more coherent and less likely to pick random or nonsensical words. A value of 0.95 means that the model will take into account 95% of the most probable words, allowing for more diversity in the output, while avoiding extreme randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **top_k**\n",
    "   controls how many of the most likely next words are considered at each step. If top_k=20, the model will only consider the top 20 most probable words for generating each word in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **candidate_count**\n",
    "   defines how many different \"candidates\" (or possible completions) the model should generate. If set to 1, the model will only generate one response. If set to a higher number, the model can generate multiple different responses from which you can choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **seed**\n",
    "   A \"seed\" is a starting point for the random number generator used in generating text. By setting a seed, the model will produce the same result each time with the same input and configuration, which is useful for reproducibility. If you want different results each time, you can change the seed. The number 5 here is just a fixed starting point for randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **stop_sequences**\n",
    "   These are special sequences or words that tell the model when to stop generating text. When the model generates the sequence \"STOP!\" (or any other stop sequence you provide), it will halt further generation.\n",

A value of 0.0 means that there is no penalty for repeating words or ideas, so the model is free to repeat as needed.\n",

    "8. **frequency_penalty**\n",

The difference is that the frequency penalty focuses more on how often a word or phrase is used, rather than just its presence. Again, a value of 0.0 means there is no penalty for frequent repetition, allowing the model to repeat words as often as necessary.\n",
