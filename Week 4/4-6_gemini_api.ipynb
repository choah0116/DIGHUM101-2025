    "The API (Application Programming Interface) of a large language model (LLM) refers to a set of predefined functions, protocols, and tools that allow developers to interact with the model programmatically. This interface enables external applications or systems to send prompts in form of texts or texts in combination with images, if the LLM is multimodal, specify criteria for generation such as temperature and system instructions, and receive generated outputs. The API essentially provides a way to integrate the LLMâ€™s capabilities into other code.\n",

    "\n",
    "In lesson 4-3_api_NYT.ipynb we saw one way to safely use an API key in a Jupyter Notebook. Another way to do this is using `.env` files. This is particularly useful when you are coding in a repository where you might accidently push your API secret keys to GitHub. Or if you ever want to deploy your code, you will need to deal with `.env` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a new file in your repository called `.env` This is the entire filename. Leave it empty for now.\n",
    "- Create another file called `.gitignore`.\n",
    "  You can add anything in the `.gitignore` file that you want GitHub to not track. This will prevent you from pushing files that you don't want changed.\n",
    "- On an empty line in the  `.gitignore` file, type `.env` and push the changes.\n",
    "  This tells GitHub to ignore the `.env` file going forward.\n",
    "- Now you can save your API key to your `.env` file. Open your `.env` file and type `GEMINI_API_KEY=\"YOUR_API_KEY\"`\n",
    "- Save your `.env` file and close it. Make sure that .env file is not listed in the source control section.\n",

    "API keys, other secrets as well as their management are really important skills to learn. A great place to start reading more about this topic is on this [blog post](https://dev.to/jakewitcher/using-env-files-for-environment-variables-in-python-applications-55a1). While preparing these materials, I found a new [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=josephdavidwilsonjr.api-vault), which I have not tested yet so I cannot recommend or urge against the use of it. If you want, you can take a look at it [here](https://medium.com/@dingersandks/why-every-developers-api-keys-are-probably-in-the-wrong-place-and-how-a-vs-code-extension-finally-c966d081d132). If for nothing else, this post shows why API keys are so important."
