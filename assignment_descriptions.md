# Assignment Descriptions

## Attendance

This course is synchronous and attendance is required. Asynchronous exceptions will be considered on a case-by-case basis, such as for those living in distant time zones. Attendance will be tracked through Zoom sign-ins. 

## Individual Project

The purpose of the individual project is to build necessary analytical skills to study the code and digital approaches behind various projects. It consists of two parts:

### Short Paper

You will choose a topic, either a methodology/approach like topic modeling or a task, like named entity recognition and identify three papers on your chosen topic. You will briefly summarize their methods, why they chose these methods, and study their code and data. You will critically evaluate the papers to understand where the weaknesses and strengths of these papers are. Your paper should be 2 pages and written in LaTeX. We will have a session dedicated to using Overleaf. 
**Deadline: 20 June 2025**

### Presentation

You will replicate the code in one of the papers you evaluated and walk us through that code.
**Deadline: 30 June 2025**

## Group Project

The group project will require you to work in small groups (3-4 students) and develop a project that answers a clearly defined question using computational methods. There are three components to the group project.

### Topic Statement

This is an open topic project, as long as it is using humanistic data and computational methods. The main limiting factor is time. This is a six-week course. Think big, but then carve out a little slice of that big idea to focus on. Make sure to match the scope and scale of your idea to the datasets available to you. In this topic statement you will describe your idea/question and identify the dataset(s) that you will use in your project. The topic statement should be 2 pages long and written in LaTeX. We will talk more about group projects in Week 1 and datasets in Week 2.
**Deadline: 06 June 2025**

### Short Paper

You will write a short paper summarizing your findings. This paper should clearly identify the question you studied and your approach to it. It should tell us the methods you used to answer this question. Your paper must include at least one data visualization. You should also explicitly state where your methods failed and what future research directions can be taken. You do not need to show your code in this paper but you will need to submit your code separately as a GitHub repository. 
**Deadline: 1 July 2025**

### Presentation

You are required to give a 10-minute presentation of your group project. A functioning Jupyter Notebook is the only acceptable format. Walk us through the notebook, your findings, and the choices you made in the research process. 
**Deadline: 1 July 2025**

### Video Reflection

Record a 3-5 minute video that demonstrates thoughtful reflection about how your ideas regarding digital humanities research grew throughout this course. Use specific examples and perspectives from your individual and group projects. You must appear in at least 30 seconds of footage. Submit on bCourses
**Deadline: 3 July 2025**
