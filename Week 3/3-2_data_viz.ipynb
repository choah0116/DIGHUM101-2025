    "Syntax: call the **library** (`sns`), followed by the plot type (`.histplot()`): `sns.histplot()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check out the [documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.histplot.html) of `sns.histplot()`. A `seaborn` plotting function typically requires two things: the dataframe and the specific subset of the data we want to plot. In this case, we pass `gap_2007` to the `data` parameter to indicate that the GDP data we want to plot comes from the `gap_2007` dataframe. We then specify `x='gdpPercap'` to indicate that the column we want to plot is `gdpPercap`. Now you can see that `sns.histplot()` is still a generic plotting function, but it integrates well with `pandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### On a more general note:\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn is a a library built on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures. It has three basic level graphing methods: `relplot()`, `distplot()` and `catplot()`, which each has a number of submethods which are basically shorthands for the main methods.\n",
