         "A DOG WITH A BAD NAME  BY TALBOT BAINES REED    CHAPTER ONE.  DRY-ROT.  Bolsover College was in a bad temper.  It often was; for as a rule it had little else to do; and what it had, was usually a less congenial occupation.  Bolsover, in fact, was a school which sadly needed two trifling reforms before it could be expected to do much good in the world.  One was, that all its masters should be dismissed; the other was, that all its boys should be expelled.  When these little changes had been effected there was every chance of turning the place into a creditable school; but not much chance otherwise.  For Bolsover College was afflicted with dry-rot.  The mischief had begun not last term or the term before.  Years ago it had begun to eat into the place, and every year it grew more incurable.  Occasional efforts had been made to patch things up.  A boy had been now and then expelled. A master had now and then \"resigned.\"  An old rule had now and then been enforced.  A new rule was now and then instituted.  But you can't patch up a dry-rot, and Bolsover crumbled more and more the oftener it was touched.  Years ago it had dropped out of the race with the other public-schools. Its name had disappeared from the pass list of the University and Civil Service candidates.  Scarcely a human being knew the name of its head- master; and no assistant-master was ever known to make Bolsover a stepping-stone to pedagogic promotion.  The athletic world knew nothing of a Bolsover Eleven or Fifteen; and, worse still, no Bolsover boy was ever found who was proud either of his school or of himself.  Somebody asks, why, if the place was in such a bad way, did parents continue to send their boys there, when they had all the public-schools in England to choose from?  To that the answer is very simple.  Bolsover was cheap--horribly cheap!  \"A high class public-school education,\" to quote the words of the prospectus, \"with generous board and lodging, in a beautiful midland county, in a noble building with every modern advantage; gymnasium, cricket-field, and a full staff of professors and masters,\" for something under forty pounds a year, was a chance not to be snuffed at by an economical parent or guardian.  And when to these attractions was promised \"a strict attention to morals, and a supervision of wardrobes by an experienced matron,\" even the hearts of mothers went out towards the place.  After all, argues many an easy-going parent, a public-school education is a public-school education, whether dear Benjamin gets it at Eton, or Shrewsbury, or Bolsover.  We cannot afford Eton or Shrewsbury, but we will make a pinch and send him to Bolsover, which sounds almost as good and may even be better.  So to Bolsover dear Benjamin goes, and becomes a public-school boy.  In that \"noble building\" he does pretty much as he likes, and eats very much what he can.  The \"full staff of professors and masters\" interfere very little with his liberty, and the \"attention to morals\" is never inconveniently obtruded.  He goes home pale for the holidays and comes back paler each term.  He scuffles about now and then in the play-ground and calls it athletics.  He gets up Caesar with a crib and Todhunter with a key, and calls it classics and mathematics.  He loafs about with a toady and calls it friendship.  In short, he catches the Bolsover dry- rot, and calls it a public-school training:  What is it makes Benjamin and his seventy-nine school-fellows (for Bolsover had its full number of eighty boys this term) in such a particularly ill-humour this grey October morning?  Have his professors and masters gently hinted to him that he is expected to know his lessons next time he goes into class?  Or has the experienced matron been overdoing her attention to his morals?  Ask him.  \"What!\" he says, \"don't you know what the row is?  It's enough to make anybody shirty. Frampton, this new head-master, you know, he's only been here a week or two, he's going to upset everything.  I wish to goodness old Mullany had stuck on, cad as he was.  He let us alone, but this beast Frampton's smashing the place up.  What do you think?--you'd never guess, he's made a rule the fellows are all to tub every morning, whether they like it or not.  What do you call that?  I know I'll get my governor to make a row about it.  It won't wash, I can tell you.  What business has he to make us tub, eh, do you hear?  That's only one thing.  He came and jawed us in the big room this morning, and said he meant to make football compulsory!  There!  You needn't gape as if you thought I was gammoning. I'm not, I mean it.  Football's to be compulsory.  Every man Jack's got to play, whether he can or not.  I call it brutal!  The only thing is, it won't be done.  The fellows will kick.  I shall.  I'm not going to play football to please a cad like Frampton, or any other cad!\"  What Benjamin says is, for a wonder, the truth.  A curious change had come over Bolsover since the end of last term.  Old Mr Mullany, good old fossil that he was, had resigned.  The boys had heard casually of the event at the end of last term.  But the old gentleman so seldom appeared in their midst, and when he did, so rarely made any show of authority, that the school had grown to look upon him as an inoffensive old fogey, whose movements made very little difference to anybody.  It was not till the holidays were over, and Mr Frampton introduced himself as the new head-master, that Bolsover awoke to the knowledge that a change had taken place.  Mr Frampton--he was not even a \"Doctor\" or a \"Reverend,\" but was a young man with sandy whiskers, and a red tie--had a few ideas of his own on the subject of dry-rot.  He evidently preferred ripping up entire floors to patching single planks, and he positively scared his colleagues and pupils by the way he set to work. He was young and enthusiastic, and was perhaps tempted to overdo things at first.  When people are being reformed, they need a little breathing time now and then; but Mr Frampton seemed to forget it.  He had barely been in his post a week when two of the under-masters resigned their posts.  Undaunted he brought over two new men, who shared his own ideas, and installed them into the vacancies.  Then three more of the old masters resigned; and three more new men took their places. Then the \"experienced matron\" resigned, and Mrs Frampton took her place.  No sooner was that done than the order went out that every boy should have a cold bath every morning, unless excused by the doctor. The school couldn't resign, so they sulked, and gasped in the unwelcome element, and coughed heart-rendingly whenever they met the tyrant.  The tyrant was insatiate.  Before the school could recover from his first shock, the decree for compulsory football staggered it.  Compulsory football!  Why, half the fellows in the school had never put their toes to a football in their lives, and those who had had rarely done more than punt the leather aimlessly about, when they felt in the humour to kick something, and nobody or nothing more convenient was at hand.  But it was useless to represent this to Mr Frampton.  \"The sooner you begin to play the better,\" was his reply to all such objections.  But the old goal posts were broken, and the ball was flabby and nearly worn-out.  \"The new goals and ball are to arrive from London to-day.\"  But they had not got flannels or proper clothes to play in.  \"They must get flannels.  Every boy must have flannels, and meanwhile they must wear the oldest shirts and trousers they had.\"  Shirts and trousers!  Then they weren't even to be allowed to wear coats and waistcoats this chilly weather!  Hadn't they better wait till next week, till they could ask leave of their parents, and get their flannels and practise a bit?  \"No.  Between now and Saturday they would have two clear days to practise.  On Saturday, the Sixth would play the School at three o'clock.\"  And Mr Frampton, there being nothing more to say on this subject, went off to see what his next pleasant little surprise should be.  Bolsover, meanwhile, snarled over the matter in ill-tempered conclaves in the play-ground.  \"It's simple humbug,\" said Farfield, one of the Sixth.  \"I defy him to make me play if I don't choose.\"  \"I shall stand with my hands in my pockets, and not move an inch,\" said another.  \"I mean to sit down on the grass and have a nap,\" said a third.  \"All very well,\" said a youngster, called Forrester; \"if you can get all the other fellows to do the same.  But if some of them play, it'll look as if you funked it.\"  \"Who cares what it looks like?\" said Farfield.  \"It will look like not being made to do what they've no right to make us do--that's all I care about.\"  \"Well, I don't know,\" said Pridger, another of the Sixth; \"if it came to the School licking us, I fancy I'd try to prevent that.\"  \"And if it came to the Sixth licking us,\" said young Forrester, who was of the audacious order, \"I fancy _I'd_ try to put a stopper on that.\"  There was a smile at this, for the valiant junior was small for his age, and flimsily built.  Smiles, however, were not the order of the day, and for the most part Bolsover brooded over her tribulations in sulky silence.  The boys had not much in common, and even a calamity like the present failed to bring them together.  The big boys mooned about and thought of their lost liberties, of the afternoons in the tuck-shop, of the yellow- backed novels under the trees, of the loafings down town, and wondered if they should ever be happy again.  The little boys--some of them--wept secretly in corners, as they pictured themselves among the killed and wounded on the terrible football field.  And as the sharp October wind cut across the play-ground, they shuddered, great and small, at the prospect of standing there on Saturday, without coats or waistcoats, and wondered if Frampton was designedly dooming them to premature graves.  A few, a very few, of the more sensible ones, tried to knock up a little practice game and prepare themselves for the terrible ordeal.  Among these were two boys belonging to the group whose conversation the reader has already overheard.  One of them, young Forrester, has already been introduced.  Junior as he was, he was a favourite all over Bolsover, for he was about the only boy in the school who was always in good spirits, and did not seem to be infected with the universal dry-rot of the place.  He was a small, handsome boy, older indeed then he looked (for he was nearly fifteen), not particularly clever or particularly jocular.  To look at him you would have thought him delicate, but there was nothing feeble in his manner.  He looked you straight in the face with a pair of brown saucy eyes; he was ready to break his neck to oblige any one; and his pocket- money (fancy a Bolsover boy having pocket-money!) was common property. Altogether he was a phenomenon at Bolsover, and fellows took to him instinctively, as fellows often do take to one whose character and disposition are a contrast to their own.  Besides this, young Forrester was neither a prig nor a toady, and devoted himself to no one in particular, so that everybody had the benefit of his good spirits, and enjoyed his pranks impartially.  The other boy, who appeared to be about eighteen or nineteen, was of a different kind.  He, too, was a cut above the average Bolsoverian, for he was clever, and had a mind of his own.  But he acted almost entirely on antipathies.  He disliked everybody, except, perhaps, young Forrester, and he found fault with everything.  Scarfe--that was his name was a Sixth Form boy, who did the right thing because he disliked doing what everybody else did, which was usually the wrong.  He disliked his school-fellows, and therefore was not displeased with Mr Frampton's reforms; but he disliked Mr Frampton and the new masters, and therefore hoped the school would resist their authority.  As for what he himself should do, that would depend on which particular antipathy was uppermost when the time came.  Curiously enough, Bolsover by no means disliked Scarfe.  They rather respected a fellow who had ideas of his own, when they themselves had so few; and as each boy, as a rule, could sympathise with his dislike of everybody else, with one exception, he found plenty of adherents and not a few toadies.  Forrester was about the only boy he really did not dislike, because Forrester did not care twopence whether any one liked him or not, and he himself was quite fond of Scarfe.  \"What do you think the fellows will do?\" said the junior, after attempting for the sixth time to \"drop\" the ball over the goal without success.  \"Why, obey, of course,\" said Scarfe scornfully.  \"Shall you?\"  \"I suppose so.\"  \"Why, I thought you were going to stick out.\"  \"No doubt a lot of the fellows would like it if I did.  They always like somebody else to do what they don't care to do themselves.\"  \"Well, you and I'll be on different sides,\" said the youngster, making another vain attempt at the goal.  \"I'm sorry for you, my boy.\"  \"So am I; I'd like to see the Sixth beaten.  But there's not much chance of it if the kicking's left to you.\"  \"I tell you what,\" said Forrester, ignoring the gibe.  \"I'm curious to know what Cad Jeffreys means to do.  We're bound to have some fun if he's in it.\"  \"Cad Jeffreys,\" said Scarfe, with a slight increase of scorn in his face and voice, \"will probably assist the School by playing for the Sixth.\"  Forrester laughed.  \"I hear he nearly drowned himself in the bath the first day, and half scragged Shrimpton for grinning at him.  If he gets on as well at football, Frampton will have something to answer for.  Why, here he comes.\"  \"Suppose you invite him to come and have a knock up with the ball,\" suggested the senior.  The figure which approached the couple was one which, familiar as it was to Bolsover, would have struck a stranger as remarkable.  A big youth, so disproportionately built as to appear almost deformed, till you noticed that his shoulders were unusually broad and his feet and hands unusually large.  Whether from indolence or infirmity it was hard to say, his gait was shambling and awkward, and the strength that lurked in his big limbs and chest seemed to unsteady him as he floundered top- heavily across the play-ground.  But his face was the most remarkable part about him.  The forehead, which overhung his small, keen eyes, was large and wrinkled.  His nose was flat, and his thick, restless lips seemed to be engaged in an endless struggle to compel a steadiness they never attained.  It was an unattractive face, with little to redeem it from being hideous.  The power in it seemed all to centre in its angry brow, and the softness in its restless mouth.  The balance was bad, and the general impression forbidding.  Jeffreys was nineteen, but looked older, for he had whiskers--an unpardonable sin in the eyes of Bolsover--and was even a little bald.  His voice was deep and loud.  A stranger would have mistaken him for an inferior master, or, judging from his shabby garments, a common gardener.  Those who knew him were in no danger of making that mistake.  No boy was more generally hated.  How he came by his name of Cad Jeffreys no one knew, except that no other name could possibly describe him.  The small boys whispered to one another that once on a time he had murdered his mother, or somebody.  The curious discovered that he was a lineal descendant of Judge Jeffreys, of hanging celebrity.  The seniors represented him as a cross between Nero and Caliban, and could not forgive him for being head classic.  The one thing fellows could appreciate in him was his temper.  A child in arms, if he knew the way, could get a rise out of Cad Jeffreys, and in these dull times that was something to be thankful for.  Forrester was perhaps the most expert of Jeffreys' enemies.  He worried the Cad not so much out of spite as because it amused him, and, like the nimble matador, he kept well out of reach of the bull all the time he was firing shots at him.  \"Hullo, Jeff!\" he called out, as the Cad approached.  \"Are you going to play in the match on Saturday?\"  \"No,\" said Jeffreys.  \"You're not?  Haven't you got any old clothes to play in?\"  Jeffreys' brow darkened.  He glanced down at his own shabby garments, and then at Scarfe's neat suit.  \"I've got flannels,\" he said.  \"Flannels!  Why don't you play, then?  Do you think you won't look well in flannels?  He would, wouldn't he, Scarfe?\"  \"I don't see how he could look better than he does now,\" replied Scarfe, looking at the figure before him.  Then noticing the black looks on his enemy's face, he added--  \"Forrester and I were having a little practice at kicking, Jeff.  You may as well join us, whether you play in the match or not.\"  \"Why, are you going to play?\" asked Jeffreys, not heeding the invitation.  \"Frampton has no right to make us do it.\"  \"Why not?  He's head-master.  Besides, you can get a doctor's certificate if you like.\"  \"No, I can't; I'm not ill.\"  \"Then you'll have to play, of course.  Everybody will, and you'd better come and practise with us now.  Do you know how to play?\"  \"Of course I do,\" said Jeffreys, \"I've played at home.\"  \"All serene.  Have a shot at the goal, then.\"  The Cad's experience of football at home must have been of a humble description, for his attempt at a kick now was a terrible fiasco.  He missed the ball completely, and, losing his balance at the same time, fell heavily to the ground.  \"Bravo!\" cried Forrester, \"I wish I'd learnt football at home; I couldn't do that to save my life.\"  \"I slipped,\" said Jeffreys, rising slowly to his feet, and flushing crimson.  \"Did you?\" said the irreverent youth.  \"I thought it was part of the play.  Stand out of the way, though, while I take a shot.\"  Before, however, Jeffreys could step aside, a neat and, for a wonder, accurate drop-kick from Forrester sent the ball violently against the side of the unwieldy senior's head, knocking off his hat and nearly precipitating him a second time to the earth.  The storm fairly burst now.  As the fleet-footed junior darted past him the other struck out wildly; but missing his blow, he seized the ball and gave a furious kick in the direction of the retreating enemy.  It was a fine drop-kick, and soared far over the head of its intended victim, straight between the goal posts, an undoubted and brilliant goal.  Forrester stopped his retreat to applaud, and Scarfe scornfully joined. \"Awfully good,\" said he; \"you certainly must play on Saturday.  We've nobody can kick like that.\"  \"I meant it to hit Forrester,\" said Jeffreys, panting with his effort, and his lips nearly white with excitement.  \"Would you like another shot?\" called out the young gentleman in question.  \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, losing your temper like that,\" said Scarfe bitterly.  \"Couldn't you see he hit you by accident?\"  \"He did it on purpose,\" said Jeffreys savagely.  \"Nonsense.  He was aiming at the goal and missed.  You did the same thing yourself, only you aimed at him.\"  \"I wish I had hit him!\" growled Jeffreys, glaring first at Scarfe, than at Forrester, and finally shambling off the ground.  \"There's a nice amiable lamb,\" said Forrester, as he watched the retreating figure.  \"I'm sometimes half ashamed to bait him, he does get into such tantrums.  But it's awfully tempting.\"  \"You'd better keep out of his way the rest of the day,\" said Scarfe.  \"Oh, bless you, he'll have worked it off in half an hour.  What do you bet I don't get him to do my Latin prose for me this afternoon?\"  Forrester knew his man; and that afternoon, as if nothing had happened, the junior sat in the Cad's study, eating some of the Cad's bread and jam while the Cad wrote out the junior's exercise for him.    CHAPTER TWO.  A FOOTBALL TRAGEDY.  The two days' grace which Mr Frampton had almost reluctantly allowed before putting into execution his new rule of compulsory athletics told very much in his favour.  Bolsover, after the first shock, grew used to the idea and even resigned.  After all, it would be a variety, and things were precious dull as they were.  As to making a rule of it, that was absurd, and Frampton could hardly be serious when he talked of doing so.  But on Saturday, if it was fine, and they felt in the humour--well, they would see about it.  With which condescending resolution they returned to their loafings and novels and secret cigarettes, and tried to forget all about Mr Frampton.  But Mr Frampton had no idea of being forgotten.  He had the schoolmaster's virtue of enthusiasm, but he lacked the schoolmaster's virtue of patience.  He hated the dry-rot like poison, and could not rest till he had ripped up every board and rafter that harboured it.  Any ordinary reformer would have been satisfied with the week's work he had already accomplished.  But Mr Frampton added yet another blow at the very heart of the dry-rot before the week was out.  On the day before the football match Bolsover was staggered, and, so to speak, struck all of a heap by the announcement that in future the school tuck-shop would be closed until after the dinner hour!  Fellows stared at one another with a sickly, incredulous smile when they first heard the grim announcement and wondered whether, after all, the new head-master _was_ an escaped lunatic.  A few gifted with more presence of mind than others bethought them of visiting the shop and of dispelling the hideous nightmare by optical demonstration.  Alas! the shutters were up.  Mother Partridge was not at the receipt of custom, but instead, written in the bold, square hand of Mr Frampton himself, there confronted them the truculent notice, \"The shop will for the future be open only before breakfast and after dinner.\"  \"Brutal!\" gasped Farfield, as he read it.  \"Does he mean to starve us as well as drown us?\"  \"Hard lines for poor old Mother Partridge,\" suggested Scarfe.  This cry took.  There was somehow a lurking sense of shame which made it difficult for Bolsover to rise in arms on account of the injury done to itself.  Money had been wasted, appetites had been lost, digestions had been ruined in that shop, and they knew it.  If you had put the question to any one of the boys who crowded down, hungry after their bath, to breakfast on the day of the football match, he would have told you that Frampton was as great a brute as ever, and that it was a big shame to make fellows play whether they liked it or not.  For all that, he would tell you, _he_ was going to play, much as he hated it, to avoid a row.  And if you had pressed him further he would have confided to you that it was expected the School would beat the Sixth, and that he rather hoped, as he must play, he would get a chance at the ball before the match was over.  From all which you might gather that Bolsover was reluctantly coming round to take an interest in the event.  \"Fortune favours the brave,\" said Mr Steele, one of his assistants, to the head-master at dinner-time.  \"You have conquered before you have struck, mighty Caesar.\"  Mr Frampton smiled.  He was flushed and excited.  Two days ago he had seemed to be committed to a desperate venture.  Now, a straight path seemed to open before him, and Bolsover, in his enthusiastic imagination, was already a reformed, reinvigorated institution.  \"Yes, Steele,\" said he, as he glanced from the window and watched the boys trooping down towards the meadow.  \"This day will be remembered at Bolsover.\"  Little dreamed the brave head-master how truly his prophecy would be fulfilled.  An arrangement had been made to give the small boys a match of their own.  The young gladiators themselves, who had secretly wept over their impending doom, were delighted to be removed beyond the reach of the giants of the Sixth.  And the leaders of the School forces were devoutly thankful to be disencumbered of a crowd of meddlesome \"kids\" who would have spoiled sport, even if they did not litter the ground with their corpses.  The sight of the new goal posts and ball, which Mr Freshfield, a junior master, was heard to explain was a present from the head-master to the school, had also a mollifying effect.  And the bracing freshness of the air and the self-respect engendered by the sensation of their flannels (for most of the players had contrived to provide themselves with armour of this healthy material) completed their reconciliation to their lot, and drove all feelings of resentment against their tyrant, for the present at any rate, quite out of their heads.  In a hurried consultation of the seniors, Farfield, who was known to be a player, was nominated captain of the senior force; while a similar council of war among the juniors had resulted in the appointment of Ranger of the Fifth to lead the hosts of the School.  Mr Freshfield, with all the ardour of an old general, assisted impartially in advising as to the disposition of the field on either side; and, for the benefit of such as might be inexperienced at the game, rehearsed briefly some of the chief rules of the game as played under the Rugby laws.  \"Now, are you ready?\" said he, when all preliminaries were settled, and the ball lay, carefully titled, ready for Farfield's kick-off.  \"Wait a bit,\" cried some one.  \"Where's Jeffreys?\"  Where, indeed?  No one had noticed his absence till now; and one or two boys darted off to look for him.  But before they had gone far a white apparition appeared floundering across the meadow in the direction of the goals; and a shout of derisive welcome rose, as Jeffreys, arrayed in an ill-fitting suit of white holland, and crowned with his blue flannel cap, came on to the scene.  \"He's been sewing together the pillow-cases to make his trousers,\" said some one.  \"Think of a chap putting on his dress shirt to play football in,\" cried another.  \"Frampton said we were to wear the oldest togs we'd got,\" said a third, \"not our Sunday best.\"  Jeffreys, as indeed it was intended, heard these facetious remarks on his strange toilet, and his brow grew heavy.  \"Come on,\" said Scarfe, as he drew near, \"it wasn't fair to the other side for you not to play.\"  \"I couldn't find my boots,\" replied the Cad shortly, scowling round him.  \"Perhaps you'll play forward,\" said Farfield, \"and if ever you don't know what to do, go and stand outside those flag posts, and for mercy's sake let the ball alone.\"  \"Boo-hoo!  I _am_ in such a funk,\" cried Forrester with his mocking laugh.  \"Thank goodness I'm playing back.\"  \"Come now,\" called Mr Freshfield impatiently, \"are you ready?  Kick off, Farfield.  Look out, School.\"  Next moment the match had begun.  As might have been expected, there was at first a great deal more confusion than play.  Bolsover was utterly unused to doing anything together, and football of all games needs united action.  There was a great deal of scrimmaging, but very few kicks and very few runs.  The ball was half the time invisible, and the other half in touch.  Mr Freshfield had time after time to order a throw-in to be repeated, or rule a kick as \"off-side.\"  The more ardent players forgot the duty of protecting their flanks and rear; and the more timid neglected their chances of \"piling up\" the scrimmages.  The Sixth got in the way of the Sixth, and the School often spoiled the play of the School.  But after a quarter of an hour or so the chaos began to resolve itself, and each side, so to speak, came down to its bearings.  Mr Frampton, as he walked across from the small boys' match, was surprised as well as delighted to notice the business-like way in which the best players on either side were settling down to their work.  There was Farfield, flushed and dogged, leading on his forwards, and always on the ball. There was Scarfe, light and dodgy, ready for a run or a neat drop-kick from half-back.  There was Ranger and Phipps of the Fifth, backing one another up like another Nisus and Euryalus.  There was young Forrester, merry and plucky, saving his goal more than once by a prompt touch-down. There, even, was the elephantine Jeffreys, snorting and pounding in the thick of the fray, feeling his feet under him, and doing his clumsy best to fight the battle of his side.  The game went hard against the School, despite their determined rallies and gallant sorties.  Young Forrester in goal had more than one man's share of work; and Scarfe's drops from the rear of the Sixth scrimmage flew near and still nearer the enemy's goal.  Once, just before half-time, he had what seemed a safe chance, but at the critical moment Jeffreys' ungainly bulk interposed, and received on his chest the ball which would certainly have carried victory to his side.  \"Clumsy lout!\" roared Farfield; \"didn't I tell you to stand out of the way and not go near the ball--you idiot!  Go and play back, do.\"  Jeffreys turned on him darkly.  \"You think I did it on purpose,\" said he.  \"I didn't.\"  \"Go and play back!\" repeated Farfield--\"or go and hang yourself.\"  Jeffreys took a long breath, and departed with a scowl to the rear.  \"Half-time!\" cried Mr Freshfield.  \"Change sides.\"  It was a welcome summons.  Both sides needed a little breathing space to gird themselves for the final tussle.  The School was elated at having so far eluded actual defeat, and cheerily rallied their opponents as they crossed over.  Jeffreys, in particular, as he made moodily to his new station, came in for their jocular greetings.  \"Thanks awfully, Cad, old man!\" cried one; \"we knew you'd give us a leg up.\"  \"My word! doesn't he look pleased with himself!\" said another.  \"No wonder!\"  \"Is that the way they taught you to play football at home?\" said young Forrester, emphasising his question with an acorn neatly pitched at the Cad's ear.  Jeffreys turned savagely with lifted arm, but Forrester was far beyond his enemy's reach, and his hand dropped heavily at his own side as he continued his sullen march to the Sixth's goal.  \"Are you ready?\" shouted Mr Freshfield.  \"Kick off.  Ranger!  Look out, Sixth!\"  The game recommenced briskly.  The School, following up the advantage of their kick-off, and cheered by their recent luck, made a desperate onslaught into the enemy's territory, which for a while took all the energy of the Sixth to repel.  Phipps and Ranger were irrepressible, and had it not been for the steady play of Scarfe and the Sixth backs, that formidable pair of desperadoes might have turned the tide of victory by their own unaided exertions.  In the defence of the seniors, Jeffreys, it need hardly be said, took no part.  He stood moodily near one of the posts, still glaring in the direction of his insulters, and apparently heedless of the fortunes, of the game.  His inaction, however, was not destined to last long.  The second half game had lasted about a quarter of an hour, and the School was still stubbornly holding their advanced position in the proximity of the enemy's goal, when the ball suddenly, and by one of those mysterious chances of battle, burst clear of the scrimmage and darted straight to where Jeffreys stood.  \"Pick it up and run--like mad!\" shouted Farfield.  With a sudden swoop which astonished his beholders the Cad pounced on the ball and started to run in the direction of the ill-protected goal of the School.  Till they saw him in motion with an almost clear field ahead, no one had had any conception how powerfully he was built or how fast he could run. The School, rash and sanguine of victory, had pressed to the front, leaving scarcely half a dozen behind to guard their rear.  Three of these Jeffreys had passed before the School was well aware what he was doing.  Then a shout of consternation arose, mingled with the frantic cheers of the Sixth.  \"Collar him!  Have him over!  Stop him there!  Look out in goal!\"  But Jeffreys was past stopping.  Like a cavalry charger who dashes on to the guns heedless of everything, and for the time being gone mad, so the Bolsover Cad, with the shouts behind him and the enemy's goal in front, saw and heard nothing else.  The two men who stepped out at him were brushed aside like reeds before a boat's keel; and with half the field before him only one enemy remained between him and victory.  That enemy was young Forrester!  There was something almost terrible in the furious career of the big boy as he bore down on the fated goal. Those behind ceased to pursue, and watched the result in breathless suspense.  Even the saucy light on Forrester's face faded as he hesitated a moment between fear and duty.  \"Collar him there!\" shouted the School.  \"He'll pass him easily,\" said the Sixth.  Forrester stepped desperately across his adversary's path, resolved to do his duty, cost what it might.  Jeffreys never swerved from his course, right or left.  \"He's going to charge the youngster!\" gasped Farfield.  Forrester, who had counted on the runner trying to pass him, became suddenly aware that the huge form was bearing straight down upon him.  The boy was no coward, but for a moment he stood paralysed.  That moment was fatal.  There was a crash, a shout!  Next moment Jeffreys was seen staggering to his feet and carrying the ball behind the goal.  But no one heeded him.  Every eye was turned to where young Forrester lay on his back motionless, with his face as white as death.    CHAPTER THREE.  GONE!  It would be difficult to picture the horror and dismay which followed the terrible termination to the football match described in our last chapter.  For a second or two every one stood where he was, as if rooted to the ground.  Then with an exclamation of horror Mr Freshfield bounded to the side of the prostrate boy.  \"Stand back and give him air!\" cried the master, as the school closed round and gazed with looks of terror on the form of their companion.  He lay with one arm above his head just as he had fallen.  His cap lay a yard or two off where he had tossed it before making his final charge. His eyes were closed, and the deathly pallor of his face was unmoved by even a quiver of life.  \"He's dead!\" gasped Farfield.  Mr Freshfield, who had been hastily loosening Forrester's collar, and had rested his hand for an instant on his heart, looked up with a face almost as white as the boy's and said--  \"Go for the doctor!--and some water.\"  Half a dozen boys started--thankful to do anything.  Before the ring could close up again the ungainly form of Jeffreys, still panting from his run, elbowed his way to the front.  As his eyes fell on the form of his victim his face turned an ashy hue.  Those who watched him saw that he was struggling to speak, but no words came.  He stood like one turned suddenly to stone.  But not for long.  With a cry something resembling a howl, the school by a sudden simultaneous movement turned upon him.  He put up his hand instinctively, half-deprecatingly, half in self- defence.  Then as his eyes dropped once more on the motionless form over which Mr Freshfield was bending, he took half a step forward and gasped, \"I did not--\"  Whatever he had intended to say was drowned by another howl of execration.  The sound of his voice seemed to have opened the floodgates and let loose the pent-up feelings of the onlookers.  A score of boys rushed between him and his victim and hustled him roughly out of the ring.  \"Murderer!\" cried Scarfe as he gave the first thrust.  And amidst echoes of that terrible cry the Cad was driven forth.  Once he turned with savage face, as though he would resist and fight his way back into the ring.  But it was only for a moment.  It may have been a sudden glimpse of that marble face on the grass, or it may have been terror.  But his uplifted hand fell again at his side, and he dragged himself dejectedly to the outskirts of the crowd.  There he still hovered, his livid face always turned towards the centre, drinking in every sound and marking every movement, but not attempting again to challenge the resentment of his school-fellows by attempting to enter the awe-struck circle.  It seemed an age before help came.  The crowd stood round silent and motionless, with their eyes fixed on the poor lifeless head which rested on Mr Freshfield's knee; straining their eyes for one sign of animation, yearning still more for the arrival of the doctor.  Mr Freshfield did not dare to lift the form, or even beyond gently raising the head, to move it in any way.  How anxiously all watched as, when the water arrived, he softly sponged the brow and held the glass to the white lips!  Alas! the dark lashes still drooped over those closed eyes, and as each moment passed Bolsover felt that it stood in the shadow of death.  At last there was a stir, as the sound of wheels approached in the lane. And presently the figure of the doctor, accompanied by Mr Frampton, was seen running across the meadow.  As they reached the outskirts of the crowd, Jeffreys laid his hand on the doctor's arm with an appealing gesture.  \"I did not mean--\" he began.  But the doctor passed on through the path which the crowd opened for him to the fallen boy's side.  It was a moment of terrible suspense as he knelt and touched the boy's wrist, and applied his ear to his chest.  Then in a hurried whisper he asked two questions of Mr Freshfield, then again bent over the inanimate form.  They could tell by the look on his face as he looked up that there was hope--for there was life!  \"He's not dead!\" they heard him whisper to Mr Frampton.  Still they stood round, silent and motionless.  The relief itself was terrible.  He was not dead, but would those deep-fringed eyes ever open again?  The doctor whispered again to Mr Frampton and Mr Freshfield, and the two passed their hands under the prostrate form to lift it.  But before they could do so the doctor, who never took his eyes off the boy's face, held up his hand suddenly, and said \"No!  Better have a hurdle,\" pointing to one which lay not far off on the grass.  A dozen boys darted for it, and a dozen more laid their coats upon it to make a bed.  Once more, amid terrible suspense, they saw the helpless form raised gently and deposited on the hurdle.  A sigh of relief escaped when the operation was over, and the sad burden, supported at each corner by the two masters, Scarfe and Farfield, began to move slowly towards the school.  \"Slowly, and do not keep step.  Above all things avoid a jolt,\" said the doctor, keeping the boy's hand in his own.  The crowd opened to let them pass, and then followed in mournful procession.  As the bearers passed on, Jeffreys, who all this time had been forgotten, but who had never once turned his face from where Forrester lay, stepped quickly forward as though to assist in carrying the litter.  His sudden movement, and the startling gesture that accompanied it, disconcerted the bearers, and caused them for a moment to quicken their step, thus imparting an unmistakable shock to the precious burden.  The doctor uttered an exclamation of vexation and ordered a halt. \"Stand back, sir!\" he cried angrily, waving Jeffreys back; \"a jolt like that may be fatal!\"  An authority still more potent than that of the doctor was at hand to prevent a recurrence of the danger.  Jeffreys was flung out of reach of the litter by twenty angry hands and hounded out of the procession.  He did not attempt to rejoin it.  For a moment he stood and watched it as it passed slowly on.  A cold sweat stood on his brow, and every breath was a gasp.  Then he turned slowly back to the spot where Forrester had fallen, and threw himself on the ground in a paroxysm of rage and misery.  It was late and growing dark as he re-entered the school.  There was a strange, weird silence about the place that contrasted startlingly with the usual evening clamour.  The boys were mostly in their studies or collected in whispering groups in the schoolrooms.  As Jeffreys entered, one or two small boys near the door hissed him and ran away.  Others who met him in the passage and on the stairs glared at him with looks of mingled horror and aversion, which would have frozen any ordinary fellow.  Jeffreys, however, did not appear to heed it, still less to avoid it. Entering the Sixth Form room, he found most of his colleagues gathered, discussing the tragedy of the day in the dim light of the bay window. So engrossed were they that they never noticed his entrance, and it was not till after standing a minute listening to their talk he broke in, in his loud tones--  \"Is Forrester dead?\"  The sound of his voice, so harsh and unexpected, had the effect of an explosion in their midst.  They recoiled from it, startled and half-scared.  Then, quickly perceiving the intruder, they turned upon him with a howl.  But this time the Cad did not retreat before them.  He held up his hand to stop them with a gesture almost of authority.  \"Don't!\" he exclaimed.  \"I'll go.  But tell me, some one, is he dead?\"  His big form loomed out in the twilight a head taller than any of his companions, and there was something in his tone and attitude that held them back.  \"You will be sorry to hear,\" said Scarfe, one of the first to recover his self-control, and with a double-edge of bitterness in his voice, \"that he was alive an hour ago.\"  Jeffreys gave a gasp, and held up his hand again.  \"Is there hope for him, then?\"  \"Not with you in the school, you murderer!\" exclaimed Farfield, advancing on the Cad, and striking him on the mouth.  Farfield had counted the cost, and was prepared for the furious onslaught which he felt certain would follow.  But Jeffreys seemed scarcely even to be aware of the blow.  He kept his eyes on Scarfe, to whom he had addressed his last question, and said--  \"You won't believe me.  I didn't mean it.\"  \"Don't tell lies,\" said Scarfe, \"you did--coward!\"  Jeffreys turned on his heel with what sounded like a sigh.  The fury of his companions, which had more than once been on the point of breaking loose in the course of the short conference, vented itself in a howl as the door closed behind him.  And yet, some said to themselves, would a murderer have stood and faced them all as he had done?  The long night passed anxiously and sleeplessly for most of the inhabitants of Bolsover.  The event of the day had awed them into something like a common feeling.  They forgot their own petty quarrels and grievances for the time, and thought of nothing but poor Forrester.  The doctor and Mr Frampton never quitted his room all night.  Boys who, refusing to go to bed, sat anxiously, with their study doors open, eager to catch the first sound proceeding from that solemn chamber, waited in vain, and dropped asleep where they sat as the night gave place to dawn. Even the masters hovered restlessly about with careworn faces, and full of misgivings as hour passed hour without tidings.  At length--it was about ten o'clock, and the school bell was just beginning to toll for morning chapel--the door opened, and Mr Frampton stepped quickly out of the sick-room.  \"Stop the bell at once!\" he said.  Then Forrester must still be living!  \"How is he?\" asked a dozen voices, as the head-master passed down the corridor.  \"There is hope,\" said Mr Frampton, \"and, thank God! signs of returning consciousness.\"  And with that grain of comfort wearied Bolsover filed slowly into church.  As Mr Frampton reached his study door he found Scarfe and Farfield waiting for him.  \"Well?\" said he wearily, seeing that they had something to say.  \"Come in.\"  They followed him into the room.  \"Is there really hope?\" said Scarfe, who truly loved the injured boy.  \"I think so.  He never moved or showed sign of life, except the beating of his heart, till an hour ago.  Then he moved his head and opened his eyes.\"  \"Did he know you, sir?\"  \"The doctor thinks he did.  But everything depends now on quiet and care.\"  \"We wanted to speak to you, sir, about the--the accident,\" said Farfield with a little hesitation.  \"Yes.  I have hardly heard how it happened, except that he fell in attempting to collar Jeffreys.  Was it not so?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" replied Farfield.  \"But--\"  \"Well, what?\" asked Mr Frampton, noticing his hesitation.  \"We don't feel sure that it was altogether an accident,\" said Farfield.  \"What!  Do you mean that the boy was intentionally injured?\"  \"Jeffreys might easily have run round him.  Anybody else would.  He had the whole field to himself, and no one even near him behind.\"  \"But was it not Forrester who got in front of him?\"  \"Of course he tried to collar him, sir,\" said Scarfe; \"but he's only a little boy, and Jeffreys is a giant.  Jeffreys might have fended him off with his arm, as he did the other fellows who had tried to stop him, or he might have run round him.  Instead of that,\"--and here the speaker's voice trembled with indignation--\"he charged dead at him, and ran right over him.\"  Mr Frampton's face clouded over.  \"Jeffreys is a clumsy fellow, is he not?\" he asked.  \"Yes,\" said Scarfe; \"and if it had been any one else than Forrester, we should all have put it down to his stupidity.\"  \"You mean,\" said the head-master, \"that he had a quarrel with Forrester?\"  \"He hated Forrester.  Every one knew that.  Forrester used to make fun of him and enrage him.\"  \"And you mean to tell me you believe this big boy of nineteen, out of revenge, deliberately ran over young Forrester in the way you describe?\"  \"I'm sure of it, sir,\" said Farfield unhesitatingly.  \"No one doubts it,\" said Scarfe.  Mr Frampton took an uneasy turn up and down the room.  He hated tale- bearers; but this seemed a case in which he was bound to listen and inquire further.  \"Scarfe and Farfield,\" said he, after a long pause, \"you know of course as well as I do the nature of the charge you are bringing against your schoolfellow--the most awful charge one human being can bring against another.  Are you prepared to repeat all you have said to me in Jeffreys' presence to-morrow, and before the whole school?\"  \"Certainly, sir,\" said both boys.  \"It was our duty to tell you, sir,\" said Scarfe; \"and only fair to poor young Forrester.\"  \"Nothing less than a sense of duty could justify the bringing of such a terrible accusation,\" said the head-master, \"and I am relieved that you are prepared to repeat it publicly--to-morrow.  For to-day, let us thank God for the hope He gives us of the poor sufferer.  Good-bye.\"  Much as he could have wished it, it was impossible for Mr Frampton, wearied out as he was with his night's watching, to dismiss from his mind the serious statement which his two senior boys had made.  The responsibility which rested on him in consequence was terrible, and it required all his courage to face it.  That afternoon he sent for Mr Freshfield, and repeated to him the substance of the accusation against Jeffreys, asking him if he had noticed anything calculated to confirm the suspicion expressed by the boys.  Mr Freshfield was naturally very much startled.  \"If you had not mentioned it,\" he said, \"I should never have dreamed of such a thing.  But I confess I have noticed that Forrester and Jeffreys were on bad terms.  Forrester is a mischievous boy, and Jeffreys, who you know is rather a lout, seems to have been his special butt.  I am afraid, too, that Jeffreys' short temper rather encouraged his tormentors.\"  \"Yes, but about the accident,\" said Mr Frampton; \"you were on the ground, you know.  Did you notice anything then?\"  \"There was a little horseplay as the sides were changing over at half- time.  Forrester, among others, was taunting Jeffreys with a bad piece of play, and threw something at him.  I was rather struck by the look almost of fury which passed across Jeffreys' face.  But it seemed to me he got better of his feelings with an effort and went on without heeding what was said to him.\"  \"That was not long before the accident?\"  \"About a quarter of an hour.  His run down the field at the last was really a good piece of play, and every one seemed surprised.  But there was any amount of room and time to get past Forrester instead of charging right on to him.  It's possible, of course, he may have lost his head and not seen what he was doing.\"  Mr Frampton shrugged his shoulders.  \"Well,\" said he with a dejected look, \"I wish you could have told me anything but what you have.  At any rate, to-morrow morning the matter must be faced and decided upon.  Jeffreys is unpopular in the school, is he not?\"  \"Most unpopular,\" said Mr Freshfield.  \"That will make our responsibility all the greater,\" said the head- master.  \"He will have every one's hand against him.\"  \"And you may be quite certain he will do himself injustice.  He always does.  But what of Forrester?\"  \"He is conscious, and has taken some nourishment; that is all I can say, except, indeed,\" added Mr Frampton, with a groan, \"that if he lives the doctor says it will be as a cripple.\"  The day dragged wearily on, and night came at last.  Most of the boys, worn-out with their last night's vigil, went to bed and slept soundly. The doctor, too, leaving his patient in the charge of a trained nurse, specially summoned, returned home, reporting hopefully of the case as he departed.  In two studies at Bolsover that night, however, there was no rest.  Far into the night Mr Frampton paced to and fro across the floor.  His hopes and ambitions had fallen like a house of cards.  The school he had been about to reform and regenerate had sunk in one day lower than ever before.  There was something worse than dry-rot in it now.  But Mr Frampton was a brave man; and that night he spent in arming himself for the task that lay before him.  Yet how he dreaded that scene to-morrow! How he wished that this hideous nightmare were after all a dream, and that he could awake and find Bolsover where it was even yesterday morning!  The other watcher was Jeffreys.  He had slept not a wink the night before, and to-night sleep seemed still more impossible.  Had you seen him as he sat there listlessly in his chair, with his gaunt, ugly face and restless lips, you would have been inclined, I hope, to pity him, cad as he was.  Hour after hour he sat there without changing his posture, cloud after cloud chasing one another across his brow, as they chased one another across the pale face of the moon outside.  At length, as it seemed, with an effort he rose to his feet and slipped off his boots.  His candle had burned nearly out, but the moon was bright enough to light his room without it, so he extinguished it and softly opened the door.  The passage was silent, the only sounds being the heavy breathing somewhere of a weary boy, and the occasional creaking of a board as he crept along on tip-toe.  At the end of the passage he turned aside a few steps to a door, and stood listening.  Some one was moving inside.  There was the rustle of a dress and the tinkle of a spoon in a cup.  Then he heard a voice, and oh, how his heart beat as he listened!  \"I'm tired,\" it said wearily.  That was all.  Jeffreys heard the smoothing of a pillow and a woman's soothing whisper hushing the sufferer to rest.  The drops stood in beads on his brow as he stood there and listened.  In a little all became quiet, and presently a soft, regular breathing told him that some one was sleeping.  He put his hand cautiously to the handle and held it there a minute before he dared turn it.  At last he did so, and opened the door a few inches.  The breathing went regularly on.  Inch by inch he pushed the door back till he could catch a glimpse in the moonlight of the bed, and a dark head of hair on the pillow.  An inch or two more, and he could see the whole room and the nurse dozing in the corner.  Stealthily, like a thief, he advanced into the room and approached the bed.  The sufferer was lying motionless, and still breathing regularly.  Jeffreys took a step forward to look at his face.  At that moment the moonlight streamed in at the window and lit up the room.  Then, to his terror, he noticed that the patient was awake, and lying with eyes wide open gazing at the ceiling.  Suddenly, and before Jeffreys could withdraw, the eyes turned and met his.  For an instant they rested there vacantly, then a gasp and a shriek of horror proclaimed that Forrester had recognised him.  In a moment he was outside the door, and had closed it before the nurse started up from her slumber.  He had not been in his study a minute when he heard a sound of footsteps and whispered voices without.  The boy's cry had reached the wakeful ears of Mr Frampton, and already he was on his way to the sick-chamber.  Jeffreys sank down on his bed in an agony of terror and suspense.  The boy's cry resounded in his ears and deafened him, till at last he could endure it no longer.  Next morning, when the school was gathered in the hall, after prayers, Mr Frampton, looking round him, missed the figure that was uppermost in his thoughts.  \"Will some one tell Jeffreys to come here?\" he said.  Mr Freshfield went, but returned suddenly to announce that Jeffreys' study was empty, and that a rope formed of sheets suspended from his window made it evident he had escaped in the night and quitted Bolsover.    CHAPTER FOUR.  GONE AGAIN.  On the evening following Jeffreys' departure from Bolsover, a middle- aged, handsome gentleman was sitting in his comfortable study in the city of York, whistling pleasantly to himself.  The house in which he lived was a small one, yet roomy enough for an old bachelor.  And what it wanted in size it made up for in the elegance and luxury of its furniture and adornments.  Mr Halgrove was evidently a connoisseur in the art of making himself comfortable.  Everything about him was of the best, and bespoke not only a man of taste but a man of means.  The books on the shelves--and where can you find any furniture to match a well-filled bookcase?--were well chosen and well bound.  The pictures on the walls were all works of art and most tastefully hung.  The knickknacks scattered about the room were ornamental as well as useful.  Even the collie dog which lay luxuriously on the hearthrug with one eye half open was as beautiful as he was faithful.  Mr Halgrove whistled pleasantly to himself as he stirred his coffee and glanced down the columns of the London paper.  If you had looked over his shoulder, you would have come to the conclusion that Mr Halgrove's idea of what was interesting in a newspaper and your own by no means coincided.  He was, in fact, reading the money article, and running his eye skilfully among the mazes of the stocks and shares there reported.  Suddenly there was a ring at the hall door and a man's voice in the hall.  Next moment the study door opened, and amid the frantic rejoicings of Julius, John Jeffreys walked into the presence of his guardian.  He was haggard and travel-stained, and Mr Halgrove, in the midst of his astonishment, noticed that his boots were nearly in pieces. Bolsover was fifty-five miles from York, and the roads were rough and stony.  The guardian, whatever astonishment he felt at this unexpected apparition, gave no sign of it in his face, as he sat back in his chair and took several quiet whiffs of his weed before he addressed his visitor.  \"Ah!\" said he, \"you've broken up early.\"  \"No, sir,\" said Jeffreys.  \"Please may I have something to eat?\"  \"Help yourself to the bread and butter there,\" said Mr Halgrove, pointing to the remains of his own tea, \"and see if you can squeeze anything out of the coffee-pot.  If not, ring for some more hot water. Lie down, Julius!\"  Jeffreys ate the bread and butter ravenously, and drank what was left in the coffee-pot and milk-jug.  Mr Halgrove went on with his cigar, watching his ward curiously.  \"The roads are rough for walking this time of the year,\" observed he.  \"Yes,\" said Jeffreys; \"I've walked all the way.\"  \"Good exercise,\" said Mr Halgrove.  \"How long did it take you?\"  \"I left Bolsover at half-past four this morning.\"  Mr Halgrove looked at his watch.  \"Fifteen hours--a fairly good pace,\" said he.  A silence ensued, during which time guardian and ward remained eyeing one another, the one curiously, the other anxiously.  \"Why not sit down,\" said Mr Halgrove, when it became evident his ward was not going to open the conversation, \"after your long walk?\"  Jeffreys dropped heavily into the chair nearest to him and Julius came up and put his head between his knees.  \"Do you often take country walks of this sort?\" said the guardian.  \"No, sir; I've run away from Bolsover.\"  Mr Halgrove raised his eyebrows.  \"Indeed!  Was it for the fun of the thing, or for any special reason?\"  \"It was because I have killed a boy,\" said Jeffreys hoarsely.  It spoke volumes for Mr Halgrove's coolness that he took this alarming announcement without any sign of emotion.  \"Have you?\" said he.  \"And was that for fun, or for any special reason?\"  \"I didn't mean it; it was an accident,\" said Jeffreys.  \"Is the story worth repeating?\" asked the guardian, knocking the ash off the end of the cigar, and settling himself in his chair.  Jeffreys told the story in a blundering, mixed-up way, but quite clearly enough for Mr Halgrove.  \"So you meant to run at him, though you didn't mean to kill him?\" said he, when the narrative was ended.  \"I did not mean to kill him,\" repeated the boy doggedly.  \"Of course it would not occur to you that you were twice his size and weight, and that running over him meant--well manslaughter.\"  \"I never thought it for a moment--not for a moment.\"  \"Was the accident fatal, at once, may I ask?\"  \"No, sir; he was brought to the school insensible, and remained so for more than twelve hours.  Then he became conscious, and seemed to be doing well.\"  \"A temporary rally, I suppose?\" observed the guardian.  Jeffreys' mouth worked uneasily, and his pale brow became overcast again.  \"No, I believe if it hadn't been for me he might have recovered.\"  \"Indeed,\" said the other, once more raising his eyebrows; \"what further attention did you bestow on him--not poison, I hope?\"  \"No, but I went to his room in the middle of the night and startled him, and gave him a shock.\"  \"Yes; playing bogey is liable to alarm invalids.  I have always understood so,\" said Mr Halgrove drily.  \"I didn't mean to startle him.  I fancied he was asleep, and just wanted to see how he seemed to be getting on.  No one would tell me a word about him,\" said Jeffreys miserably.  \"And that killed him outright?\"  \"I'm afraid it must have,\" said Jeffreys.  \"The doctor had said the least shock would be fatal, and this was a very great shock.\"  \"It would be.  You did not, however, wait to see?\"  \"No; I waited an hour or two, and then I ran away.\"  \"Did you say good-bye to the head-master before leaving?\"  \"No; nobody knew of my going.\"  \"Of course you left your address behind you, in case you should be invited to attend the inquest.\"  \"They know where I live,\" said Jeffreys.  \"Indeed!  And may _I_ ask where you live?\"  The ward's face fell at the question.  \"Here, sir,\" faltered he.  \"Pardon me, I think you are mistaken, John Jeffreys.\"  Jeffreys looked hard at his guardian, as if to ascertain whether or not he spoke seriously.  His one longing at that moment was for food and rest.  Since Saturday morning his eyes had never closed, and yet, strange as it may seem, he could take in no more of the future than what lay before him on this one night.  The sudden prospect now of being turned out into the street was overwhelming.  \"I think you are mistaken,\" repeated Mr Halgrove, tossing the end of his cigar into the fireplace and yawning.  \"But, sir,\" began Jeffreys, raising himself slowly to his feet, for he was stiff and cramped after his long journey, \"I've walked--\"  \"So you said,\" interrupted Mr Halgrove, incisively.  \"You will be used to it.\"  At that moment Jeffreys decided the question of his night's lodging in a most unlooked-for manner by doing what he had never done before, and what he never did again.  He fainted.  When he next was aware of anything he was lying in his own bed upstairs in broad daylight, and Mr Halgrove's housekeeper was depositing a tray with some food upon it at his side.  He partook gratefully, and dropped off to sleep again without rousing himself enough to recall the events of the past evening.  When, however, late in the afternoon, he awoke, and went over in his mind the events of the last few days, a dismal feeling of anxiety came over him and dispelled the comfort of his present situation.  He got out of bed slowly and painfully, for he was very stiff and footsore.  He knew not at what moment his guardian might return to the unpleasant topic of last night's conversation, and he resolved to end his own suspense as speedily as possible.  He took a bath and dressed, and then descended resolutely but with sad misgivings to the library.  Mr Halgrove was sitting where his ward had left him yesterday evening.  \"Ah,\" said he, as the boy entered, \"early rising's not your strong point, is it?\"  \"I only woke half an hour ago.\"  \"And you are anxious, of course, to know whether you have been inquired for by the police?\" said the guardian, paring his nails.  Jeffreys' face fell.  \"Has some one been?\" he asked.  \"Have you heard anything?\"  \"No one has been as yet except the postman.  He brought me a letter from Bolsover, which will probably interest you more than it does me.  It's there on the table.\"  Jeffreys took up a letter addressed in Mr Frampton's hand.  \"Am I to read it?\"  \"As you please.\"  Jeffreys opened the letter and read:--  \"Bolsover, _October_ 12.  \"S.  Halgrove, Esq.  \"Dear Sir,--I regret to inform you that your ward, John Jeffreys, left Bolsover secretly last night, and has not up to the present moment returned.  If he has returned to you, you will probably have learned by this time the circumstances which led him to take the step he has. (Here Mr Frampton briefly repeated the story of the football accident.) The patient still lingers, although the doctors do not at present hold out much hope of ultimate recovery.  I am not inclined to credit the statement current in the school with regard to the sad event, that the injury done to the small boy was not wholly due to accident.  Still, under the grave circumstances, which are made all the more serious by your ward's flight, I suggest to you that you should use your authority to induce Jeffreys to return here--at any rate for as long as Forrester's fate remains precarious; or, failing that, that you should undertake, in the event of a legal inquiry being necessary, that he shall be present if required.  \"Faithfully yours,--  \"T.  Frampton.\"  \"Pleasant letter, is it not?\" said Mr Halgrove as Jeffreys replaced it in its envelope and laid it again on the table.  \"I can't go back to Bolsover,\" said he.  \"No?  You think you are not appreciated there?\"  Jeffreys winced.  \"But I will undertake to go there if--\"  \"If the coroner invites you, eh?\"  \"Yes,\" replied the boy.  \"The slight difficulty about that is that it is I, not you, that am asked to make the undertaking.\"  \"But you will, won't you?\" asked Jeffreys eagerly.  \"I have the peculiarity of being rather particular about the people I give undertakings for,\" said Mr Halgrove, flicking a speck of dust off his sleeve; \"it may be ridiculous, but I draw the line at homicide.\"  \"You're a liar!\" exclaimed the ward, in a burst of fury, which, however, he repented of almost before the words had escaped him.  Mr Halgrove was not in the slightest degree disturbed by this undutiful outbreak, but replied coolly,--  \"In that case, you see, my undertaking would be worth nothing.  No. What do you say to replying to Mr Frampton's suggestion yourself?\"  \"I will write and tell him I will go whenever he wants me.\"  \"The only objection to that,\" observed the guardian, \"will be the difficulty in giving him any precise address, will it not?\"  Jeffreys winced again.  \"You mean to turn me adrift?\" said he bluntly.  \"Your perception is excellent, my young friend.\"  \"When?\"  Mr Halgrove looked at his watch.  \"I believe Mrs Jessop usually locks up about eleven.  It would be a pity to keep her up after that hour.\"  Jeffreys gulped down something like a sigh and turned to the door.  \"Not going, are you?\" said the guardian.  \"It's early yet.\"  \"I am going,\" replied the ward quietly.  \"By the way,\" said Mr Halgrove, as he reached the door, \"by the way, John--\"  Jeffreys stopped with his hand on the latch.  \"I was going to say,\" said the guardian, rising and looking for his cigar-case, \"that the little sum of money which was left by your father, and invested for your benefit, has very unfortunately taken to itself wings, owing to the failure of the undertaking in which it happened to be invested.  I have the papers here, and should like to show them to you, if you can spare me five minutes.\"  Jeffreys knew nothing about money.  Hitherto his school fees had been paid, and a small regular allowance for pocket-money had been sent him quarterly by his guardian.  Now his guardian's announcement conveyed little meaning to him beyond the fact that he had no money to count upon.  He never expected he would have; so he was not disappointed.  \"I don't care to see the papers,\" he said.  \"You are a philosopher, my friend,\" said his guardian.  \"But I have sufficient interest in you, despite your financial difficulties, to believe you might find this five-pound note of service on your travels.\"  \"No, thank you,\" said Jeffreys, putting his hand behind his back.  \"Don't mention it,\" said his guardian, returning it to his pocket. \"There is, when I come to think of it,\" added he, \"a sovereign which really belongs to you.  It is the balance of your last quarter's allowance, which I had been about to send to you this week.  I would advise you to take it.\"  \"Is it really mine?\"  \"Pray come and look over the accounts.  I should like to satisfy you.\"  \"If it is really mine I will take it,\" said the boy.  \"You are sensible,\" said his guardian, putting it into his hand.  \"You are perfectly safe in taking it.  It is yours.  It will enable you to buy a few postage stamps.  I shall be interested to hear of your success.  Good-bye.\"  Jeffreys, ignoring the hand which was held out to him, walked silently from the room.  Mr Halgrove stood a moment and listened to the retreating footsteps.  Then he returned to his chair and rang the bell.  \"Mrs Jessop,\" said he, \"Mr Jeffreys is going on a journey.  Will you kindly see he has a good meal before starting?\"  Mrs Jessop went upstairs and found Jeffreys writing a letter.  \"Master says you're going a journey, sir.\"  \"Yes.  I shall be starting in half an hour.\"  \"Can't you put it off till to-morrow, sir?\"  \"No, thanks.  But I want to finish this letter.\"  \"Well, sir, there'll be some supper for you in the parlour.  It's master's orders.\"  Jeffreys' letter was to Mr Frampton.  \"Sir,\" he wrote, \"I left Bolsover because I could not bear to be there any longer.  I did not mean to injure Forrester so awfully, though I was wicked enough to have a spite against him.  I am not a murderer, though I am as bad as one.  If I could do anything to help Forrester get better I would come, but I should only make everything worse.  My guardian has turned me away, and I shall have to find employment.  But the housekeeper here, Mrs Jessop, will always know where I am, and send on to me if I am wanted.  I should not think of hiding away till I hear that Forrester is better.  If he dies I should not care to live, so I should be only too glad to give myself up.  I cannot come back to Bolsover now, even if I wanted, as I have only a pound, and my guardian tells me that is all the money I have in the world.  Please write and say if Forrester is better.  I am too miserable to write more.  \"Yours truly,--  \"John Jeffreys.\"  Having finished this dismal letter, he packed up one or two of his things in a small handbag and descended to the parlour.  There he found an ample supper provided for him by the tender-hearted Mrs Jessop, who had a pretty shrewd guess as to the nature of the \"journey\" that her master's ward was about to take.  But Jeffreys was not hungry, and the announcement that the meal was there by the \"master's orders\" turned him against it.  \"I can't eat anything, thank you,\" he said to Mrs Jessop, \"you gave me such a good tea only a little while ago.\"  \"But you've a long journey, Master John.  Is it a long journey, sir?\"  \"I don't know yet,\" he said.  \"But I want you to promise to send me on any letter or message that comes, will you?\"  \"Where to?\"  \"To the head post-office, here.\"  \"Here?  Then you're not going out of York?\"  \"Not at first.  I'll let you know when I go where to send on the letters.\"  \"Mr John,\" said the housekeeper, \"the master's turned you away.  Isn't that it?\"  \"Perhaps he's got a reason for it.  Good-bye, Mrs Jessop.\"  \"Oh, but Mr John--\"  But John interrupted her with a kiss on her motherly cheek, and next moment was gone.    CHAPTER FIVE.  FREDDY AND TEDDY.  John Jeffreys, as he stood in the street that October evening, had no more idea what his next step was to be than had Mr Halgrove or the motherly Mrs Jessop.  He was a matter-of-fact youth, and not much given to introspection; but the reader may do well on this particular occasion to take a hasty stock of him as he walked aimlessly down the darkening street.  He was nineteen years old.  In appearance he was particularly ugly in face and clumsy in build.  Against that, he was tall and unusually powerful whenever he chose to exert his strength.  In mind he was reputed slow and almost stupid, although he was a good classical scholar and possessed a good memory.  He was cursed with a bad and sometimes ungovernable temper.  He was honest and courageous.  He rarely knew how to do the right thing at the right time or in the right place.  And finally he had a bad name, and believed himself to be a homicide.  Such was the commonplace creature who, with a sovereign in his pocket and the whole world before him, paced the streets of York that Tuesday night.  On one point his mind was made up.  He must remain in York for the present, prepared at a moment's notice to repair to Bolsover, should the dreaded summons come.  With that exception, as I have said, his mind was open, and utterly devoid of ideas as to the future.  He directed his steps to the poor part of the town, not so much because it was poor, as because it was farthest away from his guardian's.  He resolved that to-night at any rate he would indulge in the luxury of a bed, and accordingly, selecting the least repulsive-looking of a number of tenements offering \"Cheap beds for Single Men,\" he turned in and demanded lodging.  To the end of his days he looked back on the \"cheap bed\" he that night occupied with a shudder.  And he was by no means a Sybarite, either.  Happily, he had still some sleep to make up; and despite his foul bed, his unattractive fellow-lodgers, and his own dismal thoughts, he fell asleep, in his clothes and with his bag under his pillow, and slept till morning.  He partook of a cheap breakfast at a coffee-stall on one of the bridges, and occupied the remainder of the time before the opening of business houses in wandering about on the city walls, endeavouring to make up his mind what calling in life he should seek to adopt.  He had not decided this knotty point when the minster chimes struck ten, and reminded him that he was letting the precious moments slip.  So he descended into the streets, determined to apply for the first vacancy which presented itself.  Wandering aimlessly on, he came presently upon a bookseller's shop, outside which were displayed several trays of second-hand volumes which attracted his attention.  Jeffreys loved books and was a voracious reader, and in the midst of his wearisome search for work it was like a little harbour of refuge to come upon a nest of them here.  Just, however, as he was about to indulge in the delicious luxury of turning over the contents of the tempting trays, his eye was attracted by a half-sheet of note-paper gummed on to the shop window and bearing the inscription, \"Assistant wanted.  Apply within.\"  Next instant Jeffreys stood within.  \"I see you want an assistant,\" said he to the old spectacled bookseller who inquired his business.  \"That's right.\"  \"Will you take me?\"  The man glanced up and down at his visitor and said doubtfully,--  \"Don't know you--are you in the trade?\"  \"No, I've just left school.\"  \"What do you know about books?\"  \"I love them,\" replied the candidate simply.  The bookseller's face lit up and shot a glow of hope into the boy's heart.  \"You love them.  I like that.  But take my advice, young fellow, and if you love books, don't turn bookseller.\"  Jeffreys' face fell.  \"I'm not afraid of getting to hate them,\" said he.  The man beamed again.  \"What's your name, my lad?\"  \"John Jeffreys.\"  \"And you've just left school?  What school?\"  Alas! poor Jeffreys!  It cost him a struggle to utter the name.  \"Bolsover.\"  \"Bolsover, eh?  Do you know Latin?\"  \"Yes--and Greek,\" replied the candidate.  The bookseller took up a book that lay on the table.  It was an old and valuable edition of Pliny's _Epistles_.  \"Read us some of that.\"  Jeffreys was able fairly well to accomplish the task, greatly to the delight of the old bookseller.  \"Capital!  You're the first chap I ever had who could read Pliny off.\"  Jeffreys' face lit up.  The man spoke as if the thing was settled.  \"How will fifteen shillings a week and your meals suit you?\" said he.  \"Perfectly!\" replied the candidate.  \"Hum! you've got a character, of course?\"  Poor Jeffreys' face fell.  \"Do you mean testimonials?\"  \"No.  You can refer to some one who knows you--your old schoolmaster, for instance.\"  \"I'm afraid not,\" faltered the boy.  The man looked perplexed.  \"Couldn't get a character from him--why not?\"  \"Because I ran away from school.\"  \"Oh, oh!  Did they ill-treat you, then, or starve you?  Come; better tell the truth.\"  \"No--it wasn't that.  It was because--\" Jeffreys gave one longing look at the shelves of beloved books, and an appealing glance at his questioner--\"It was because I--nearly killed a boy.\"  The man whistled and looked askance at his visitor.  \"By accident?\"  \"Partly.  Partly not.  But I assure you--\"  \"That will do,\" said the man; \"that's quite enough.  Be off!\"  Jeffreys departed without another word.  Like Tantalus, the tempting fruit had been within reach, and his evil destiny had come in to dash it from his lips.  Was it wonderful if he felt disposed to give it up and in sheer desperation go back to Bolsover?  The whole of the remainder of that day was spent in spiritless wandering about the streets.  Once he made another attempt to obtain work, this time at a merchant's office.  But again the inconvenient question of character was raised, and he was compelled to denounce himself.  This time his confession was even more unfeelingly received than at the bookseller's.  \"How dare you come here, you scoundrel?\" exclaimed the merchant in a rage.  \"Don't call me a scoundrel!\" retorted Jeffreys, his temper suddenly breaking out.  \"I'll call a policeman if you are not out of here in half a minute. Here, you boys,\" added he, calling his six or eight clerks, \"turn this wretch out of the place.  Do you hear?\"  Jeffreys spared them the trouble and stepped into the street, determined to die before he laid himself open to such an indignity again.  His last night's experience at a common lodging-house did not tempt him to seek shelter again now, and as it was a fine mild night even at that time of year he trudged out of York into one of the suburbs, where at least everything was clean and quiet.  He had the good fortune in a country lane to come across a wagon laid up by the roadside, just inside a field--a lodging far more tempting than that offered by Mr Josephs, and considerably cheaper.  The fatigues and troubles of the day operated like a feather-bed for the worn-out and dispirited outcast, and he slept soundly, dreaming of Forrester, and the bookshop, and the dog Julius.  Next morning the weary search began again.  Jeffreys, as he trudged back to the city, felt that he was embarked on a forlorn hope.  Yet a man must live, and a sovereign cannot last for ever.  He passed a railway embankment where a gang of navvies were hard at work.  As he watched them he felt half envious.  They had work to do, they had homes to return to at night, they had characters, perhaps.  Most of them were big strong fellows like himself.  Why should he not become one of them?  He fancied he could wheel a barrow, and ply a crowbar, and dig with a spade, as well as any of them; he was not afraid of hard work any more than they were, and the wages that kept a roof over their heads would surely keep a roof over his.  As he sat on a bank by the roadside and watched them, he had almost resolved to walk across to the foreman and ask for a job, when the sound of voices close to him arrested him.  They were boys' voices, and their talk evidently referred to himself, \"Come along, Teddy,\" said one.  \"He won't hurt.\"  \"I'm afraid,\" said the other.  \"He's so ugly.\"  \"Perhaps that's how he gets his living--scaring the crows,\" said the first speaker.  \"He looks as if he meant to kill us.\"  \"I shall fight him if he tries.\"  Jeffreys looked round and had a view of the valiant speaker and his companion.  They were two neatly dressed little fellows, hand-in-hand, and evidently brothers.  The younger--he who considered his life in danger--was about eight, his intrepid brother being apparently about a year his senior. They had little satchels over their shoulders, and parti-coloured cricket caps on their little curly heads.  Their faces were bright and shining, the knees of their stockings were elaborately darned, the little hands were unmistakably ink-stained, and their pockets were bulged out almost to bursting.  Such was the apparition which confronted the Bolsover \"cad\" as he sat slowly making up his mind to become a labourer.  The younger brother drew back and began to cry, as soon as he perceived that the terrible villain on the bank had turned and was regarding them.  \"Freddy, Freddy, run!\" he cried.  \"I shan't,\" said Freddy with a big heave of his chest.  \"I'm not afraid.\"  The fluttering heart beneath that manly bosom belied the words, as Freddy, dragging his brother by the hand, walked forward.  Jeffreys did not exactly know what to do.  Were he to rise and approach the little couple the consequences might be disastrous.  Were he to remain where he was or skulk away, he would be allowing them to believe him the ruffian they thought him, and that lane would become a daily terror to their little lives.  The only thing was to endeavour to make friends.  \"What are you afraid of?\" said he, in as gentle a manner as he could. \"I won't hurt you.\"  The sound of his voice caused the smaller boy to scream outright, and even the elder trembled a little as he kept himself full front to the enemy.  \"You little donkeys, I'm a schoolboy myself,\" said Jeffreys.  This announcement had a magical effect.  The younger brother stopped short in his scream, and Freddy boldly took two steps forward.  \"Are you a boy?\" inquired the latter.  \"Of course I am.  I was in the top form.  I'm older than you, though.\"  \"I'm ten,\" replied the proud owner of that venerable age.  \"I'm nine in February,\" chimed in the still-fluttered junior.  \"I'm about as old as you two put together.  How old's that, Freddy?\"  \"Nineteen,\" said Freddy.  By this time Jeffreys had gradually descended the bank and stood close to the two small brothers.  \"Bravo, young 'un, you can do sums, I see!\"  \"Compound division and vulgar fractions,\" said Freddy confidentially.  Jeffreys gave a whistle of admiration which won the heart of his hearer.  \"Are you going to school now?\" inquired the latter.  \"No; I've left school,\" said Jeffreys, \"last week.\"  \"Last week! why, it's only the middle of the term.  Were you sent away?\"  Jeffreys began to feel uncomfortable in the presence of this small cross-examiner.  \"I got into trouble and had to leave.\"  \"I know why,\" said the younger brother, plucking up courage.  \"Why?\" inquired Jeffreys, with an amused smile.  \"Because you were so ugly!\"  Jeffreys laughed.  \"Thank you,\" said he.  \"Was it because you killed the master?\" asked the more matter-of-fact Freddy.  Poor Jeffreys winced before this random shot, and hastened to divert the conversation.  \"Whose school do you go to?\" he inquired.  \"Trimble's; we hate her,\" said the two youths in a breath.  \"Why?  Does she whack you?\"  \"No; but she worries us, and young Trimble's worse still.  Do you know the school?\"  \"No.  What's the name of the house?\"  \"Oh, Galloway House, in Ebor Road.  It wasn't so bad when Fison was there,\" continued the open-hearted Freddy; \"but now he's gone. Trimble's a cad.\"  \"We hate her,\" chimed in the original Teddy.  \"We hope the new master will be like Fison, but I don't believe Trimble can get any one to come,\" said Freddy.  Jeffreys pricked up his ears and asked a good many questions about the school, which the youthful pair readily and gaily replied to, and then suggested that if Trimble was such a cad the boys had better not be late.  \"Have some parliament cake?\" said Freddy, opening his satchel and producing a large square of crisp gingerbread.  Jeffreys had not the heart to refuse a little piece of this delicacy, and enjoyed it more than the most sumptuous meal in an hotel.  Teddy also insisted on his taking a bite out of his apple.  \"Good-bye,\" said the little fellow, putting up his face in the most natural manner for a kiss.  Jeffreys felt quite staggered by this unexpected attention, but recovered his presence of mind enough to do what was expected of him.  Freddy, on the other hand, looked rather alarmed at his young brother's audacity, and contented himself with holding out his hand.  \"Good-bye, little chap,\" said Jeffreys, feeling a queer lump in his throat and not exactly knowing which way to look.  Next moment the two little brothers were trotting down the road hand-in- hand as gay as young larks.  Jeffreys thought no more about the navvies, or the delights of a labourer's life.  A new hope was in him, and he strolled slowly back into York wondering to himself if angels ever come to men in the shape of little schoolboys.  It was still early when he reached the city.  So he spent sixpence of his little store on a bath in the swimming baths, and another sixpence on some breakfast.  Then, refreshed in body and mind, he called at the post-office.  There was nothing for him there.  Though he hardly expected any letter yet, his heart sunk as he thought what news might possibly be on its way to him at that moment.  The image of Forrester as he lay on the football field haunted him constantly, and he would have given all the world even then to know that he was alive.  Hope, however, came to his rescue, and helped him for a time to shake off the weight of his heart, and address himself boldly to the enterprise he had in hand.  That enterprise the acute reader has easily guessed.  He would offer his services to the worthy Mrs Trimble, _vice_ Mr Fison, resigned.  He never imagined his heart could beat as quickly as it did when after a long search he read the words--\"Galloway House.  Select School for Little Boys,\" inscribed on a board in the front garden of a small, old- fashioned house in Ebor Road.  The sound of children's voices in the yard at the side apprised him that he had called at a fortunate time.  Mrs Trimble during the play-hour would in all probability be disengaged.  Mrs Trimble was disengaged, and opened the door herself.  Jeffreys beheld a stoutish harmless-looking woman, with a face by no means forbidding, even if it was decidedly unintellectual.  \"Well, young man,\" said she.  She had been eating, and, I regret to say, had not finished doing so before she began to speak.  \"Can I see Mrs Trimble, please?\" asked Jeffreys, raising his hat.  The lady, finding her visitor was a gentleman, hastily wiped her mouth and answered rather lest brusquely.  \"I am the lady,\" said she.  \"Excuse me,\" said Jeffreys, \"I called to ask if you were in want of an assistant teacher.  I heard that you were.\"  \"How did you hear that, I wonder?  I suppose he's a friend of that Fison.  Yes, young man, I am in want of an assistant.\"  \"I should do my best to please you, if you would let me come,\" said Jeffreys.  And then, anxious to avoid the painful subject of his character, he added, \"I have not taught in a school before, and I have no friends here, so I can't give you any testimonials.  But I am well up in classics and pretty good in mathematics, and would work hard, ma'am, if you would try me.\"  \"Are you a steady young man?  Do you drink?\"  \"I never touch anything but water; and I am quite steady.\"  \"What wages do you expect?\"  \"I leave that to you.  I will work for nothing for a month till you see if I suit you.\"  Mrs Trimble liked this.  It looked like a genuine offer.  \"Are you good-tempered and kind to children?\" she asked.  \"I am very fond of little boys, and I always try to keep my temper.\"  His heart sank at the prospect of other questions of this kind.  But Mrs Trimble was not of a curious disposition.  She knew when she liked a young man and when she didn't, and she valued her own judgment as much as anybody else's testimonials.  \"You mustn't expect grand living here,\" she said.  \"I was never used to anything but simple living,\" said he.  \"Very well, Mr --\"  \"Jeffreys, ma'am.\"  \"Mr Jeffreys, we'll try how we get on for a month; and after that I can offer you a pound a month besides your board.\"  \"You are very kind,\" said Jeffreys, to whom the offer seemed a magnificent one.  \"I am ready to begin work at once.\"  \"That will do.  You'd better begin now.  Come this way to the schoolroom.\"    CHAPTER SIX.  GALLOWAY HOUSE.  My business-like readers have, I dare say, found fault with me for representing a business conference on which so much depended as having taken place on the front doorstep of Galloway House, and without occupying much more than five minutes in the transaction.  How did Jeffreys know what sort of person Mrs Trimble was?  She might have been a Fury or a Harpy.  Her house might have been badly drained.  Mr Fison might have left her because he couldn't get his wages.  And what did Mrs Trimble know about the Bolsover cad?  She never even asked for a testimonial.  He might be a burglar in disguise, or a murderer, or a child-eater.  And yet these two foolish people struck a bargain with one another five minutes after their first introduction, and before even the potatoes which Mrs Trimble had left on her plate when she went to the door had had time to get cold.  I am just as much surprised as the reader at their rashness, which I can only account for by supposing that they were both what the reader would call \"hard up.\"  Jeffreys, as we know, was very hard up; and as for Mrs Trimble, the amount of worry she had endured since Mr Fison had left was beyond all words.  She had had to teach as well as manage, the thing she never liked.  And her son and assistant, without a second usher to keep him steady, had been turning her hair grey.  For three weeks she had waited in vain.  Several promising-looking young men had come and looked at the place and then gone away.  She had not been able to enjoy an afternoon's nap for a month.  In short, she was getting worn-out. When, therefore, Jeffreys came and asked for the post, she had to put a check on herself to prevent herself from \"jumping down his throat.\" Hence the rapid conference at the hall door, and the ease with which Jeffreys got his footing in Galloway House.  \"Come and have a bite of mutton,\" said Mrs Trimble, leading the way into the parlour.  \"Jonah and I are just having dinner.\"  Jonah, who, if truth must be told, had been neglecting his inner man during the last five minutes in order to peep through the crack of the door, and overhear the conference in the hall between his mother and the stranger, was a vulgar-looking youth of about Jeffrey's age, with a slight cast in his eye, but otherwise not bad-looking.  He eyed the new usher as he entered with a mingled expression of suspicion and contempt; and Jeffreys, slow of apprehension though he usually was, knew at a glance that he had not fallen on a bed of roses at Galloway House.  \"Jonah, this is Mr Jeffreys; I've taken him on in Fison's place.  My son, Mr Jeffreys.\"  Jonah made a face at his mother, as much as to say, \"I don't admire your choice,\" and then, with a half-nod at Jeffreys, said,--  \"Ah, how are you?\"  \"Jonah and I always dine at twelve, Mr Jeffreys,\" said Mrs Trimble, over whom the prospect of the afternoon's nap was beginning to cast a balmy sense of ease.  \"You two young men will be good friends, I hope, and look well after the boys.\"  \"More than you do,\" said the undutiful Jonah; \"they've been doing just as they please the last month.\"  \"It's a pity, Jonah, you never found fault with that before.\"  \"What's the use of finding fault?  No end to it when you once begin.\"  \"Well,\" observed the easy-going matron, \"you two will have to see I don't have occasion to find fault with you.\"  Jonah laughed, and asked Jeffreys to cut him a slice of bread.  Presently Mrs Trimble quitted the festive board, and the two ushers were left together.  \"Lucky for you,\" said young Trimble, \"you got hold of ma and pinned her down to taking you on on the spot.  What's she going to pay you?\"  The question did not altogether please the new assistant, but he was anxious not to come across his colleague too early in their acquaintanceship.  \"She pays me nothing the first month.  After that, if I suit, I'm to have a pound a month.\"  \"If you suit?  I suppose you know that depends on whether I like you or not?\"  \"I hope not,\" blurted out Jeffreys--\"that is,\" added he, seeing his mistake, \"I hope we shall _get_ on well together.\"  \"Depends,\" said Trimble.  \"I may as well tell you at once I hate stuck- uppedness (this was a compound word worthy of a young schoolmaster).  If you're that sort you'd better cry off at once.  If you can do your work without giving yourself airs, I shall let you alone.\"  Jeffreys was strongly tempted after this candid avowal to take the youthful snob's advice and cry off.  But the memory of yesterday's miserable experiences restrained him.  He therefore replied, with as little contempt as he was able to put into the words,--  \"Thanks.\"  Trimble's quick ear detected the ill-disguised scorn of the reply.  \"You needn't try on that sort of talk,\" said he; \"I can tell you plump, it won't do.  You needn't think because ma took you on for the asking, you're going to turn up your nose at the place!\"  \"I don't think so,\" said Jeffreys, struggling hard with himself.  \"How many boys are there here?\"  \"Forty-four.  Are you anything of a teacher?  Can you keep order?\"  \"I don't know; I haven't tried yet.\"  \"Well, just mind what you're about.  Keep your hands off the boys; we don't want manslaughter or anything of that sort here.\"  Jeffreys started.  Was it possible that this was a random shot, or did Trimble know about Bolsover and young Forrester?  The next remark somewhat reassured him.  \"They're looking sharp after private schools now; so mind, hands off. There's one o'clock striking.  All in!  Come along.  You'd better take the second class and see what you can make of them.  Precious little ma will put her nose in, now you're here to do the work.\"  He led the way down the passage and across a yard into an outhouse which formed the schoolroom.  Here were assembled, as the two ushers entered, some forty boys ranging in age from seven to twelve, mostly, to judge from their dress and manners, of the small shopkeeper and farmer class.  The sound of Trimble's voice produced a dead silence in the room, followed immediately by a movement of wonder as the big, ungainly form of the new assistant appeared.  Jeffreys' looks, as he himself knew, were not prepossessing, and the juvenile population of Galloway House took no pains to conceal the fact that they agreed with him.  \"Gordon,\" said Trimble, addressing a small boy who had been standing up when they entered, \"what are you doing?\"  \"Nothing, sir.\"  \"You've no business to be doing nothing!  Stand upon that form for an hour!\"  The boy obeyed, and Trimble looked round at Jeffreys with a glance of patronising complacency.  \"That's the proper way to do with them,\" said he.  \"Plenty of ways of taking it out of them without knocking them about.\"  Jeffreys made no reply; he felt rather sorry for the weak-kneed little youngster perched up on that form, and wondered if Mr Trimble would expect him (Jeffreys) to adopt his method of \"taking it out\" of his new pupils.  Just then he caught sight of the familiar face of Master Freddy, one of his friends of the morning, who was standing devouring him with his eyes as if he had been a ghost.  Jeffreys walked across the room and shook hands with him.  \"Well, Freddy, how are you?  How's Teddy?\"  \"I say,\" said Trimble, in by no means an amiable voice, as he returned from this little excursion, \"what on earth are you up to?  What did you go and do that for?\"  \"I know Freddy.\"  \"Oh, do you?  Freddy Rosher, you're talking.  What do you mean by it?\"  \"Please, sir, I didn't mean--\"  \"Then stay in an hour after school, and write four pages of your copy- book.\"  It took all Jeffreys' resolution to stand by and listen to this vindictive sentence without a protest.  But he restrained himself, and resolved that Freddy should find before long that all his masters were not against him.  \"That's your fault,\" said Trimble, noticing the dissatisfied look of his colleague.  \"How are we to keep order if you go and make the boys break rules?  Now you'd better get to work.  Take the second class over there and give them their English history.  James the Second they're at.  Now, you boys, first class, come up to me with your sums.  Second class, take your history up to Mr Jeffreys.  Come along; look alive!\"  Jeffreys thereupon found himself mobbed by a troop of twenty of the youngest of the boys, and haled away to a desk at the far end of the room, round which they congregated book in hand, and waited for him to commence operations.  It was an embarrassing situation for the new usher.  He had never been so fixed before.  He had often had a crowd of small boys round him, tormenting him and provoking him to anger; but to be perched up here at a desk, with twenty tender youths hanging on the first word which should fall from his lips, was to say the least, a novel experience.  He glanced up towards the far end of the room, in the hopes of being able to catch a hint from the practised Jonah as to how to proceed.  But he found Jonah was looking at him suspiciously over the top of his book, and that was no assistance whatever.  The boys evidently enjoyed his perplexity; and, emboldened by his recent act of friendliness to the unlucky Freddy, regarded him benevolently.  \"Will some one lend me a book?\" at last said Jeffreys, half desperate.  A friendly titter followed this request.  \"Don't you know it without the book?\" asked one innocent, handing up a book.  \"I hope you do,\" said Jeffreys, blushing very much as he took it. \"Now,\" added he, turning to the reign of James II, \"can any one tell we what year King James II came to the throne?\"  \"Please, sir, that's not the way,\" interposed another irreverent youngster, with a giggle.  \"You've got to read it first, and then ask us.\"  Jeffreys blushed again.  \"Is that the way?\" said he.  \"Very well.  James II succeeded his brother Charles in 1685.  One of his first acts on coming--\"  \"Oh, we're long past that,\" said two or three of his delighted audience at a breath; \"we've done to where Monmouth's head was cut off.\"  This was very uncomfortable for the new master.  He coloured up, as if he had been guilty of a scandalous misdemeanour, and fumbled nervously with the book, positively dreading to make a fresh attempt.  At last, however, he summoned up courage.  \"The death of this ill-fated nobleman was followed by a still more terrible measure of retribution against those who had--\"  \"Please, sir, we can't do such long words; we don't know what that means.  You've got to say it in easy words, not what's put in the book.\"  Jeffreys felt that all the sins of his youth were rising up against him that moment.  Nothing that he had ever done seemed just then as bad as this latest delinquency.  \"After Monmouth's death they made it very--(hot, he was going to say, but he pulled himself up in time), they made it very (whatever was the word?)--very awkward for those who had helped him.  A cruel judge named Jeffreys--\"  That was a finishing stroke!  The reader could have sunk through the floor as he saw the sensation which this denunciation of himself caused among his audience.  There was not a shadow of doubt in the face of any one of them as to his identity with the ferocious judge in question. What followed he felt was being listened to as a chapter or autobiography, and nothing he could say could now clear his character of the awful stain that rested upon it.  \"A cruel judge condemned more than three hundred persons--\"  \"You forgot to say his name, please, sir,\" they put in.  \"Never mind his name; that is, I told you once, you should remember,\" stammered the hapless usher.  \"I remember it.  Jeffreys, wasn't it, Mr Jeffreys?\" said one boy triumphantly.  \"He condemned more than--\"  \"Who, Jeffreys?\"  What was the use of keeping it up?  \"Yes; this wicked judge, Jeffreys, condemned more than three hundred people to death, just because they had helped Monmouth.\"  There was a low whistle of horror, as every eye transfixed the speaker.  \"Did he repent?\" asked one.  \"It doesn't say so,\" said the wretched Jeffreys, turning over to the next page in a miserable attempt to appear as if he was not involved in the inquiry.  \"How dreadful!\" said another.  \"Besides this, 849 people were transported.\"  \"By Jeffreys, sir?\"  \"Yes,\" replied the owner of the name, finally throwing off all disguise and giving himself up to his fate, \"by this wicked Jeffreys.\"  \"Yes, sir; and what else did he do?\"  Trimble, as he looked every now and then down the room, was astonished to notice the quiet which prevailed in the lower class, and the interest with which every boy was listening to the new master.  He did not like it.  He couldn't manage to interest his class, and it didn't please him at all that this casual newcomer should come and cut him out before his face.  After a while he walked down the room and approached the assistant's desk.  He was convinced this, unwonted order could not result from any legitimate cause.  \"You don't seem to be doing much work here, I must say,\" said he.  \"Give me the book, Mr Jeffreys: I want to see what they know of the lesson. Where's the place?\"  Jeffreys handed the book, putting his finger on the place.  Trimble glanced through a paragraph or two, and then pointing to a boy, one of the least sharp in the class, said,--  \"Now, Walker, what happened after Monmouth's death?\"  \"Oh, if you please, sir, a cruel judge, called Jeffreys, condemned--\"  \"That will do.  You, Rosher, how many people did he condemn to death?\"  \"More than three hundred, sir,\" answered Freddy promptly.  \"What for, Bacon?\"  \"Because they helped Monmouth.\"  Trimble felt perplexed.  He never had a class that answered like this. He tried once more.  \"Pridger, what else did he do?\"  \"He had 849 transported, sir.\"  Trimble shut the book.  It was beyond him.  If Pridger had said 848 or 850, he could have made something of it.  But it floored him completely to find the second class knowing the exact number of convicts in one given year of English history.  \"Don't let me catch any of you wasting your time,\" he said.  \"Farrar, what do you mean by looking about you, sir?  Stand on the form for half an hour.\"  \"Farrar has been very quiet and attentive all the afternoon,\" said Jeffreys.  \"Stand on the form an hour, Farrar,\" said Trimble, with a scowl.  Jeffreys' brow darkened as he watched the little tyrant strut off to his class.  How long would he be able to keep hands off him?  The rest of the afternoon passed uneventfully.  An unconscious bond of sympathy had arisen between the new master and his pupils.  His historical importance invested him with a glamour which was nearly heroic; and his kind word on Farrar's behalf had won him an amount of confidence which was quick in showing itself.  \"We like you better than Fison, though he was nice,\" said Bacon, as the class was about to separate.  \"I hope Trimble won't send you away,\" said another.  \"I wish you'd condemn young Trimble to death, or transport him, Mr Jeffreys,\" said a third confidentially.  \"Good-bye, Mr Jeffreys,\" said Freddy, with all the confidence of an old friend.  \"Did you like that parliament cake?\"  \"Awfully,\" said Jeffreys.  \"Good-bye.\"  Every one insisted on shaking hands with him, greatly to his embarrassment; and a few minutes later the school was scattered, and Jeffreys was left to go over in his mind his first day's experience.  On the whole he was cheerful.  His heart warmed to these simple little fellows, who thought none the worse of him for being ugly and clumsy. With Mrs Trimble, too, he anticipated not much difficulty.  Young Trimble was a rock ahead undoubtedly, but Jeffreys would stand him as long as he could, and not anticipate the day, which he felt to be inevitable, when he would be able to stand him no longer.  \"Well, Mr Jeffreys,\" said Mrs Trimble, as the dame and her two assistants sat down to tea, \"how do you manage?\"  \"Pretty well, thank you, ma'am,\" replied Jeffreys; \"they are a nice lot of little boys, and I found them very good and quiet.\"  \"Of course you would, if you let them do as they like,\" said Jonah. \"You'll have to keep them in, I can tell you, if you expect to keep order.\"  It did occur to Jeffreys that if they were good without being kept in, Jonah ought to be satisfied, but he was too wise to embark on a discussion with his colleague, and confined his attentions to Mrs Trimble.  The meal being ended, he said--  \"Will you excuse me, ma'am, if I go into the city for about an hour?  I have to call at the post-office for letters.\"  \"Look here,\" said Jonah, \"we don't let our assistants out any time they like.  It's not usual.  They ought to stay here.  There's plenty of work to do here.\"  \"It's very important for me to get the letters, Mrs Trimble,\" said Jeffreys.  \"Well, of course, this once,\" said the matron, glancing uneasily at her son; \"but, as Jonah says, we like our young men to stay in, especially at night.  We parted with Mr Fison because he was not steady.\"  \"Thank you, ma'am,\" said Jeffreys; \"if the letters have come to-day I shall not have to trouble you again.  Can I do anything for you in town?\"  \"That chap won't do,\" said Jonah to his mother when at last Jeffreys started on his expedition.  \"I think he will; he means well.  It wouldn't do, Jonah,\" said the good lady, \"to have all the trouble again of finding a young man.  I think Mr Jeffreys will do.\"  \"I don't,\" said Jonah sulkily, taking up a newspaper.  Jeffreys meanwhile, in a strange frame of mind, hurried down to the post-office.  The day's adventures seemed like a dream to him as he walked along, and poor Forrester seemed the only reality of his life.  Would there be a letter?  And what news would it bring him?  During the last twelve hours a new hope and object in life had opened before him. But what was it worth, if, after all, at this very moment Forrester should be lying lifeless at Bolsover?  \"Have you any letter for John Jeffreys?\" he asked; but his heart beat so loud that he scarcely heard his own voice.  The man, humming cheerily to himself, took a batch of letters out of a pigeon-hole and began to turn them over.  Jeffreys watched him feverishly, and marvelled at his indifference.  \"What name did you say--Jones?\"  \"No, Jeffreys--John Jeffreys.\"  Again he turned over the bundle, almost carelessly.  At length he extracted a letter, which he tossed onto the counter.  \"There you are, my beauty,\" said he.  Jeffreys, heeding nothing except that it was addressed in Mr Frampton's hand, seized the missive and hastened from the office.  At the first shop window he stood and tore it open.  \"My dear Jeffreys,--I was glad to hear from you, although your letter gave me great pain.  It would have been wiser in you to return here, whatever your circumstances might be; wiser still would it have been had you never run away.  But I do not write now to reproach you.  You have suffered enough, I know.  I write to tell you of Forrester.\"  Jeffreys gave a gasp for breath before he dare read on.  \"The poor fellow has made a temporary rally, but the doctors by no means consider him out of danger.  Should he recover, which I fear is hardly probable, I grieve to say the injuries he has received would leave him a cripple for life.  There is an injury to the spine and partial paralysis, which, at the best, would necessitate his lying constantly on his back, and thus being dependent entirely on others.  If he can bear it, he is to be removed to his home in a day or two.  He has asked about you, and on my telling him that I was writing to you, said, `Tell him I know it was only an accident.'  I am sure that this letter will grieve you; I wish I could say anything which will help you.  May God in His mercy bring good to us all out of this sorrow!  As for yourself, I hope that your guardian's resentment will be short-lived, and that you will let me hear of your welfare.  Count on me as a friend, in spite of all.  \"Yours always,--  \"T.  Frampton.\"  \"In spite of all!\" groaned poor Jeffreys, as he crushed the letter into his pocket.  \"Will no one have pity on me?\"    CHAPTER SEVEN.  WHAT A DAY FOR JONAH!  The six months which followed Jeffreys' introduction into the classical atmosphere of Galloway House passed uneventfully for him, and not altogether unpleasantly.  He had, it is true, the vision of young Forrester always in his mind, to drag him down, whenever he dwelt upon it, into the bitterest dejection; and he had the active spite and insolence of Jonah Trimble daily to try his temper and tax his patience.  Otherwise he was comfortable.  Mrs Trimble, finding him steady and quiet, treated him kindly when she had her own way, and indifferently when her son was with her.  The boys of the second class maintained the mysterious respect they had conceived for him on the day of his arrival, and gave him wonderfully little trouble or difficulty.  He had his evenings for the most part to himself, and even succeeded, after something like a battle-royal with the Trimbles, in carrying his point of having one \"evening out\" in the week.  It nearly cost him his situation, and it nearly cost Jonah a bone-shaking before the question was settled.  But Jeffreys could be stubborn when he chose, and stood out grimly on this point.  Had it not been for this weekly respite, Galloway House would have become intolerable before a month was over.  He heard occasionally from Mr Frampton; but the one question which would have interested him most was generally passed over.  Mr Frampton probably considered that any reference to Forrester would be painful to his correspondent, and therefore avoided it.  At last, however, in reply to Jeffreys' entreaty to know where the boy was and how he was progressing, the head-master wrote:--  \"I really cannot tell you what you want to know about Forrester, as I have heard nothing of him.  His father, as you know, is an officer in India, and his only relative in England was his grandmother, to whose house at Grangerham he was removed on leaving here.  The last I heard was a month after he had left here, when he was reported still to be lingering.  His grandmother, so I heard, was very ill.  He himself, as a last hope, was to be removed to a hospital (I could not hear which) to receive special treatment.  Since then--which is five months ago--I have heard nothing, and my last letter to Grangerham was returned by the Dead-Letter Office.  I wish I could tell you more.  You may depend on my doing so should I hear of him again,\" etc.  It is hardly to be wondered at after this that poor Jeffreys felt the weight upon him heavier than ever.  As long as he had known where Forrester was, and had the hope of hearing from time to time how he fared, he had been able to buoy himself up with the hope of some day making up to his victim for the injury he had inflicted; but when, suddenly, Forrester dropped hopelessly out of his life, the burden of his conscience grew intolerable.  He struggled hard, by devoting himself to his boys and by hard private study in his leisure hours, to drive the haunting memory away, but the effort succeeded only for a time.  At night, as he lay in bed, unable to escape from himself, the vision of that pale face and that cry of terror hardly once left him till merciful sleep came to his rescue.  And by day, when his small pupils vexed him, or the spiteful Jonah tempted him to revenge, the thought of Forrester cowed him into submission, and left him no choice but to endure what seemed to be his penance.  \"Ma,\" said Mrs Trimble's hopeful, one afternoon after school had closed, \"you've been nicely taken in over that Jeffreys, I can tell you.\"  \"What!\" said the lady.  \"He doesn't drink, does he?\"  \"Don't know.  But there's something queer about him, and I mean to find it out.  I'm not going to let it go on, I can tell you.\"  \"Why, what's he been doing, Jonah?\"  \"Doing?  You must go about with your eyes shut if you don't see he's been sulking ever since he came here.  I tell you there's something wrong.\"  \"Oh, don't say that, Jonah.\"  \"You never took a character with him, did you?\"  \"No; he hadn't been in a place before.\"  \"Depend on it, ma, he's skulking.  He's done something, and finds this a convenient place to hide away in.\"  \"But, Jonah, he's never shown any signs of not being all right.  He's very kind to the boys, and keeps them in wonderful order, better than you do almost.\"  Jonah did not like this, because he knew it was true.  His boys were neither fond of him nor obedient to his control, and the fact that Jeffreys' boys were both was additional proof that there was something wrong.  \"Do you suppose he can't manage to take you in, ma?  Of course, any one could.\"  \"But he makes himself very pleasant, and studies, and keeps very quiet out of school.\"  \"Of course.  Isn't that what I tell you?  He's hiding.  What do you suppose he skulks away into town for once a week--eh?\"  \"Not to drink, I do hope?\" said the lady.  \"Whatever it is, I mean to get to the bottom of it, for the sake of the school,\" said Jonah.  \"Fancy the mess we'd get into if it got known we had a shady character here as a teacher!\"  \"But, Jonah, dear, it's only suspicion.  He may be all right.\"  \"Oh, anything _may_ be,\" retorted the philosophic Jonah.  \"The thing is--is it?\"  As Mrs Trimble was unable to answer this question, she retired from the discussion, and hoped devoutly nothing was going to happen which would necessitate her doing more work about the school than she at present did.  The unconscious Jeffreys meanwhile was upstairs, washing himself before starting for his weekly \"evening out.\"  He had more than usual before him on this particular evening, as, besides calling at the post-office-- an errand he never missed--he had discovered another old bookshop across the river which kept open till seven o'clock.  And after that he had promised Freddy and Teddy, with whom from the first he had kept up a warm friendship, to call up at their house and help them mend their tricycle.  With this full programme before him, he lost no time in starting on his travels; little dreaming that the quick pace at which he strode along gave unwonted exercise to Mr Jonah Trimble, who, animated by an amiable curiosity, dogged his footsteps at a respectful distance.  It was about five o'clock when Jeffreys reached the post-office.  The clerk knew him by this time, and this evening handed him a letter without being asked.  It was a short friendly line from Mr Frampton with no news--at any rate about Forrester; and Trimble, as he watched him emerge from the office, letter in hand, and haggard in face, chalked down in in his own mind a first clue as to the mystery that was exercising him.  From the post-office Jeffreys strolled leisurely down the streets toward the bridge, stopping to look into some of the shops by the way, and occasionally making Trimble's heart jump by looking behind him.  In due time he pulled up at the bookseller's shop.  Trimble saw the proprietor welcome his visitor with a nod which bespoke an acquaintance of some standing.  He saw Jeffreys turning over the contents of some of the trays, taking up a book now and then and examining it, and sometimes propping himself up against the doorpost and reading page after page. It was not very entertaining work for the spy; but curiosity is patient, and Jonah as he watched the unconscious reader at a safe distance fortified himself by the conviction that he was watching the working-out of some deep-laid plot.  Presently he saw Jeffreys disappear into the shop, and what was his amazement, when presently he \"casually\" passed the door, to see him seated with the bookseller at a table earnestly poring over and discussing a small faded sheet of paper which lay between them!  Trimble would have given worlds to know what the mysterious document was, and what villainy was brewing.  Had he known it, he might not have stood out there in the evening air quite as patiently as he did.  For the mysterious document happened to be nothing but an old tattered and torn Commonwealth tract which Jeffreys had discovered folded up between the leaves of an ancient volume of poetry, and which he and his friend the bookseller were spending a very agreeable half-hour in piecing together and deciphering.  About seven o'clock Jeffreys rose to go, pocketing the precious relic, which his friend had given him; and Trimble, having carefully noted down the name of the shop and the personal appearance of the suspicious bookseller, followed gingerly back across the bridge.  The streets were getting less crowded, and Jonah had increasing difficulty in keeping himself concealed as he crawled along on the opposite side of the way some thirty or forty yards in the rear of his man.  Just as Jeffreys was crossing the space opposite the grand front of the minster a dog sprang forward to meet him with every token of joy.  It was Julius, and Jeffreys knew that the master could not be very far away.  He turned round for a moment, as though he meditated flight, and gave Jonah a spasm by the unexpected movement.  But before he could decide Mr Halgrove strolled pleasantly round the corner, and nodded to him as if he and his ward had not parted five minutes before.  \"Ah, John, fine evening for a stroll.  On your way home?\"  Mr Halgrove till that moment had not had the faintest idea that his ward was still in York.  \"No,\" said Jeffreys, patting the dog's head and looking very much the reverse of comfortable.  \"They say the front of the minster is beginning to crumble at places,\" said Mr Halgrove, looking up at the noble pile before them; \"I hope it's not true.  Are you much here?\"  \"No.  I live in another part of the town.\"  \"Very odd my meeting you,\" said Mr Halgrove.  \"I was thinking of you only to-day.  I had a letter from Mr Frampton.\"  \"Indeed, sir--about Forrester?\"  \"About--oh, your little victim?  Oddly enough, it was not.  It was to remind me that your last half-term's fees were not paid.  Don't you think it would be judicious to clear up this little score?  Looks bad, you know--to run away with score against you.\"  Jeffrey's face turned pale.  He had at least supposed that up to the time of his expulsion from his guardian's house Mr Halgrove would have considered himself responsible for his maintenance.  \"I never dreamt,\" he faltered.  \"How much is it?\"  \"Quite a little sum, isn't it?  Come, you were last at school.  Too bad to pose me with compound division at my time of life.  Half a term at 40 a year?\"  \"Seven pounds!\" gasped Jeffreys.  \"Not quite, 6 13 shillings, 4 pence.  Fancy my being better at mental arithmetic than you!\"  \"I haven't got any money.  I only get a pound a month and my board.\"  \"My dear boy, I congratulate you.  Twelve pounds a year!  Now, wasn't it a pity you didn't take that 5 note I offered you?  Suppose you take it now!\"  Mr Halgrove put his hand to his pocket and took out his purse.  \"No!\" exclaimed Jeffreys, in a tone that made Trimble, who was busy engaged in inspecting the architecture of the minster from behind a deep buttress close to the speaker, jump--\"I'd sooner die!\"  \"Don't do that, my dear fellow, don't do that,\" said Mr Halgrove, with a smile which belied the anger he felt at the refusal; \"rather than that I'll keep the money.  I have no wish to commit a murder.  It's not in my line.  That's one point in which you and I differ, isn't it?\"  Jeffreys made as though he would spring upon him.  What was it checked him?  Was it the solemn minster--was it a dread of his guardian's superior strength--was it fear of punishment?  Or was it a momentary glimpse of a pale face in a moonlit room far away, which took the spirit out of him and made his arm drop at his side?  \"Well, I won't keep you,\" said Mr Halgrove, who had also for a moment looked uneasy.  \"I dare say you are in a hurry like myself.  The fact is, I am going a trip to America next week and have a good deal to attend to.  That makes me doubly glad to have met you.  Good-bye, my dear boy, good-bye.  Come, Julius.\"  Julius as he slunk off at his master's heels, and heard the smothered oath which escaped Mr Halgrove's lips as soon as he found himself alone, looked round wistfully and pitifully, and wished he were allowed to go where he pleased.  Jeffreys walked on like a man in a dream.  For six months he had been working out what had been to him a penance, hoping to live down his bad name, even if he could never win a good.  But now in a moment it seemed as if the labour of those patient months had been dashed to the ground, and his guardian's bitter words branded themselves on his heart as he paced on out of the shadow of the noble minster into the dusk of the city.  Trimble, nearly bursting with excitement--for he had overheard all the latter part of the conversation--crept after him.  What a time he was having!  Jeffreys bent his steps almost aimlessly out of the city into the country beyond.  It was only half-past seven, and Teddy and Freddy were expecting him.  He had not the heart to fail them, though he would gladly have remained solitary that evening.  The Roshers lived in a small cottage some distance down the lane in which six months ago Jeffreys had first encountered the sunshine of their presence.  How long ago it seemed now!  Ah! that was the very bank on which he sat; and there beyond was the railway embankment at which the navvies were working, now finished and with the grass growing up its sides.  Trimble's little heart jumped to his mouth as he saw the man he was following stop abruptly and begin to climb the bank.  He was too close behind to be able to turn back.  All he could do was to crouch down in the ditch and \"lie low.\"  He heard Jeffreys as he gained the top of the bank sigh wearily; then he seemed to be moving as if in search of a particular spot; and then the lurker's hair stood on end as he heard the words, hoarsely spoken,--  \"It was this very place.\"  What a day Jonah was having!  After a quarter of an hour's pause, during which the patient Jonah got nearly soaked to the skin in his watery hiding-place, Jeffreys roused himself and descended into the lane.  Any one less abstracted could not have failed to detect the scared face of the spy shining out like a white rag from the hedge.  But Jeffreys heeded nothing and strode on to Ash Cottage.  Long before he got there, Freddy and Teddy, who had been on the look-out for him for an hour, scampered down to meet him.  \"Hurrah, Jeff!\" shouted Teddy (I grieve to say that these irreverent brethren had long ago fallen into the scandalous habit of calling their teacher by a familiar contraction of his proper name, nor had the master rebuked them).  \"Hurrah, Jeff! we were afraid you weren't coming.\"  \"The tricycle won't go,\" said Freddy; \"we've pulled it all to bits, and tried to make it right with a hammer, but it's very bad.\"  \"It's glorious you've come to do it.  Isn't Jeff a brick, Teddy?\"  \"Rather--and, oh, did you bring any oil?  We used all ours up.\"  \"We've got a screw-driver, though!\" said Freddy.  \"And lots of string!\" shouted Teddy.  \"You _are_ a brick to come and do it,\" shouted both.  Where in the world is there a tonic equal to the laugh of a light- hearted grateful little boy?  How could Jeffreys help forgetting his trouble for a time and devoting himself heart and soul to the business of that tricycle?  Trimble, as he dodged along after them perplexed and puffing, could hardly believe his eyes as he saw his morose colleague suddenly throw off the burden that was on him and become gay.  \"Come along, little chaps--let's see what we can do,\" said Jeffreys, as the three strode out to the cottage.  \"Where is he?\"  \"In the shed.  We've got a candle.\"  Trimble saw them disappear into the garden, and, guided by their cheery voices, soon discovered the back of the shed in which the momentous surgical operation was to take place.  It backed on the road, and might have been built for Trimble's purpose.  For the woodwork abounded in most convenient cracks, through which a spy might peep and listen luxuriously.  What a day Jonah was having!  The Roshers conducted their friend into the place like anxious relatives who conduct a physician into a sick-chamber.  The poor patient lay on the floor in a very bad way.  Two wheels were off, the axle was bent, the wire spokes were twisted, the saddle was off, and the brake was all over the place.  Jeffreys shook his head and looked grave.  \"It's a bad job,\" said he.  \"You see, we were giving mother a ride on it, and she's too heavy-- especially going downhill.  She thought we were holding it, but it got away.  We yelled to her to put on the brake, but she didn't, and it went bang into the wall.\"  \"And your mother?\" inquired Jeffreys, somewhat anxiously.  \"Oh, her face is much better now.  The doctor says there'll be hardly any marks left after all.\"  It was a long business putting the unlucky tricycle in order.  Jeffreys was not a mechanic.  All he could do was to put the parts together in a makeshift way, and by straightening some of the bent parts and greasing some of the stiff parts restore the iron horse into a gloomy semblance of his old self.  The boys were as grateful and delighted as if he had constructed a new machine out of space; and when at last a trial trip demonstrated that at any rate the wheels would go round and the saddle would carry them, their hearts overflowed.  \"You are a real brick, Jeff,\" said Teddy; \"I wish I could give you a hundred pounds!\"  \"I don't want a hundred pounds,\" said Jeffreys, with a smile; \"if you and Freddy and I are good friends, that's worth a lot more to me.\"  \"Why?\" demanded Freddy; \"are we the only friends you've got?\"  Jeffreys looked out of the window and said,--  \"Not quite--I've got one more.\"  \"Who--God?\" asked the boy naturally.  Poor Jeffreys!  He sometimes forgot that Friend, and it startled and humbled him to hear the little fellow's simple question.  \"Of course, he's got Him,\" interposed Teddy, without giving him time to reply.  \"But who else, Jeff?\"  \"I saw him not long ago,\" said Jeffreys.  \"His name's Julius.\"  \"You don't like him more than us, do you?\" asked Teddy rather anxiously.  \"Not a quarter as much, old chap,\" said Jeffreys.  There was a pause, during which Trimble chuckled to think how little the speaker guessed into whose ears he was betraying the name of his villainous accomplice!  Presently, however, he started to hear the sound of his own name.  \"Jeff,\" said Teddy, \"isn't Mr Trimble a beast?\"  \"Let's talk about something pleasant,\" suggested Jeffreys, by way of begging the question.  \"Let's talk about hanging him; that would be pleasant,\" said Teddy.  \"Would you be sorry if he was dead?\" demanded Teddy, in his matter-of- fact way.  \"I say, Jeff, wouldn't it be jolly if we could kill everybody we hated?\"  \"Wouldn't it be jolly if every little boy who talked like a little donkey were to have his ears boxed?\" said Jeffreys.  \"I wish he'd been on the tricycle instead of mother,\" continued Teddy, with a sigh of content at the bare idea.  \"Teddy, you are not as nice a little boy as I thought when you talk like that,\" said Jeffreys.  \"Come and let's have one more turn on the machine, and then I must hurry back, or Mrs Trimble will think I'm lost.\"  Jeffreys got back to Galloway House about ten o'clock, and found Jonah sitting up for him.  \"So you _have_ come back,\" said that individual pompously.  \"I hope you've enjoyed your evening out.\"  \"Yes,\" said Jeffreys, \"pretty well.\"  \"Oh!\" said Jonah to himself, as he went up to bed, bursting with excitement.  \"If he only knew what I know!  Let me see--\"  And then he went over in his mind the events of that wonderful evening, the visit to the post-office and the horrified look as he came out letter in hand; the mysterious conference with the bookseller, doubtless over this very letter.  And how artfully he had been pretending to look at the books outside till he saw no one was looking!  Then, the secret meeting with his accomplice in the minster yard--Mr Julius, yes, that was the name he had himself told the boys--and the altercation over the money, doubtless the booty of their crime, and Mr Julius's denunciation of Jeffreys as a murderer!  Whew!  Then that lonely country walk, and that search on the bank, and that exclamation, \"It was this very place!\" Whew!  Jonah had tied a bit of his bootlace on the hedge just under the spot, and could find it again within a foot.  Then the rencontre with the two boys and the strange, enigmatical talk in the shed, pointing to the plot of a new crime of which he--Trimble--was to be the victim.  Ha, ha!--and the business over that tricycle too, in the candle-light. Jonah could see through that.  He could put a spoke in a wheel as well as Jeffreys.  Two things were plain.  He must get hold of the letter; and he must visit the scene of the crime _with a spade_!  Then--  Jonah sat up half the night thinking of it, till at last the deep breathing of his colleague in the next room reminded him that now at any rate was the time to get the letter.  He had seen Jeffreys crush it into his side pocket after leaving the bookseller's and he had heard him before getting into bed just now hang his coat on the peg behind the door.  And it was hot, and the door was open.  What a day Jonah was having!  Fortune favours the brave.  It was a work of two minutes only.  The pocket was there at his hand before he had so much as put a foot in the room.  And there was the letter--two letters--and not a board creaked or a footstep sounded before he was safe back in his own room with the documentary evidence before him.  There was only one letter after all.  The other paper was a rubbishing rigmarole about General Monk and the Parliament 1660.  This Jonah tossed contemptuously into the grate.  But the other letter, how his flesh crept as he read it!  It had no date, and was signed only in initials.  \"Dear J.  There is no news.  I can understand your trouble and remorse, and this uncertainty makes it all the more terrible to you.  I know it is vain to say to you, `Forget,' but do not write about poor Forrester's blood being on your head!  Your duty is to live and redeem the past. Let the dead bury their dead, dear fellow, and turn your eyes forward, like a brave man.  Yours ever, J.F.\"  Do you wonder if Jonah's blood curdled in his veins--\"remorse,\" \"uncertainty,\" \"poor Forrester,\" \"his blood on your head,\" eh? \"bury your dead\"!  Whew!  _What_ a day Jonah had had, to be sure!    CHAPTER EIGHT.  I KNOW A BANK.  Jonah Trimble may not have been a genius of the first water, but he was at least wise enough to know that he could not both have his cake and eat it.  His discovery of Jeffreys' villainy was a most appetising cake, and it wanted some little self-denial to keep his own counsel about it, and not spoil sport by springing his mine until all the trains were laid.  Another consideration, moreover, which prevented his taking immediate action was that Jeffreys was extremely useful at Galloway House, and could not be spared just yet--even to the gallows.  In a few months' time, when the good name of the school, which had rapidly risen since he came upon the scene, was well established, things might be brought to a climax.  Meanwhile Jonah Trimble would keep his eye on his man, read his _Eugene Aram_, and follow up his clues.  Jeffreys awoke on the following morning with a feeling of oppression on his mind which for a little time he could not define.  It was not his guardian's words, bitter as they had been; it was not the insolence of his fellow-usher, intolerable as that was becoming.  When at last his wandering thoughts came in and gave the trouble shape, he found it took a much more practical form.  He was in debt seven pounds to Mr Frampton.  It never occurred to him to wonder whether Mr Halgrove had been telling him the truth or not, nor to his unbusinesslike mind did it occur that his guardian, as the trustee responsible for what money he once had, was liable for the debt, however much he might like to repudiate it.  No; all he knew was that Mr Frampton was owed seven pounds, and that he himself had nothing, or next to nothing, to pay.  By hard saving during the six months he had managed to save a sovereign, but of this only last week he had spent the greater part in boots and clothing.  Now his worldly wealth consisted of four shillings!  He was down early that morning, and was relieved to find that Mrs Trimble was in the parlour alone, without her son.  The good lady was in an amiable mood.  The school was getting on, and something told her that it was not greatly due either to her own exertions or the influence of Jonah.  Therefore, being a mathematical old lady, she subtracted herself and Jonah from the present school staff, and came to the conclusion that Jeffreys must have had a hand in the improvement.  \"Young man,\" said she, in reply to her assistant's greeting, \"you've been with me six months.  Are you comfortable?\"  \"Pretty well,\" said Jeffreys.  \"I'm very fond of my boys, and I always get on comfortably with you.\"  The mathematical dame once more went to work, and answered, \"You and Jonah don't hit it, I suppose.  You don't know Jonah, young man.  He may not be easily satisfied, but he's a gentleman.\"  \"I'm sure,\" said Jeffreys, to whom this tribute seemed the last he should expect to hear bestowed on his amiable fellow-usher, \"I try to get on with him, and shall go on trying.\"  \"That's right,\" said Mrs Trimble, once more shuddering at the prospect of being left short-handed.  \"What I was going to say to you was, that now you've been here six months, and are not a forward young man, and don't drink, I shall raise your wages, and give you thirty shillings a month instead of twenty.  How will that suit you?\"  \"You are very kind,\" said the grateful Jeffreys, with a tremble in his voice which quite moved the old lady's heart; \"it will be very acceptable.\"  \"Very good.  You need not mention it to Jonah,\" added she hurriedly, as that young gentleman's footsteps were heard that moment on the stairs.  The only difference which the unconscious Jeffreys was aware of in the conduct of Jonah Trimble towards himself was that the young gentleman was a trifle more hectoring and a trifle more facetious than before.  But even to the little mind of Jonah Trimble it had been revealed that at present it would be extremely awkward for Galloway House if Jeffreys went \"on strike.\"  He was a good teacher and manager; and his boys were devoted to him.  Of course, when a boy goes home from school full of the praises of his teacher, his parents are pleased too, and think well of the school, and tell their friends what a nice place it is for boys, and so on.  It is a good advertisement, in fact.  Besides, with Mrs Trimble so lazy, and Jonah himself so unattractive, it would involve a great deal of trouble all round if Jeffreys deserted it.  They knew by experience that young fellows of good education did not as a rule jump at the situation of second usher in Galloway House.  And they knew, also, something of the horrors of a prolonged vacancy in their staff.  Jonah was rather relieved when Jeffreys, immediately after school, shut himself up in his own room, and remained there studying for the rest of the evening.  The proceeding favoured a little idea of his own, which was to revisit the spot where he had tied his bootlace the evening before, and see if an examination of that fatal spot would throw any fresh light on his investigation.  Accordingly after tea he sallied forth with a trowel in his coat pocket.  It was rather a dismal expedition, for it rained, and there was a cool breeze.  The lane was muddy even in the roadway, and on the banks it was a quagmire.  Still Jonah was too full of his mystery seriously to mind the weather.  He trudged up and down the lane, sharply scrutinising the hedge for his bootlace.  For a long time his perseverance was unrewarded.  At length, however, his eye detected the welcome flutter of a bright tag among the leaves, and he recognised the scene of last night's damp sojourn.  He clambered up onto the bank, regardless of his garments, and commenced an anxious scrutiny.  The bank itself showed no signs of a \"mystery.\" Even the traces of Jeffreys' visit to it the night before were obliterated by the soaking rain.  The field on the other side was equally unsuggestive.  Jonah trampled around in circles on the young corn, but never a pistol, or a rusty knife, or a bottle of poison, did he discover.  Yet he had heard the villain say distinctly,--  \"This was the very place!\"  He scrambled back rather crestfallen on to the bank.  It was getting dark, and the rain came down ceaselessly, yet so strong was his certainty that here he should discover the evidence he was looking for, that for another half-hour he plied his trowel diligently.  Sometimes when it struck on a stone or the roots of a bramble, he trembled with anticipation; and once, when, groping under a hedge, his hand suddenly encountered a dead rat, his hair literally stood on end.  He began to get nervous and uncomfortable.  The night became suddenly dark, and the wind whistled all sorts of weird tunes among the trees. Jonah did not exactly believe in ghosts; still, if there were such things, this was just the night and just the place for the ghost he was looking for to take its walk abroad.  He did not like it, and began to wish he was safe at home.  The bushes round him began to rustle noisily, and a gate in the field swung to and fro with an almost human groan.  He fancied he could descry wandering lights and white gleams in the darkness, and the vague consciousness of something coming nearer and nearer.  At last, with a great effort, he roused himself from his moist seat, and leaped down from the bank into the lane.  The instant his feet touched the road he was conscious of a low growl, and next moment found himself pinned, with his back to the bank, by a furious dog.  His yell of terror had mingled with the wind for a couple of minutes before he became aware of the red glow of a cigar in front of him, and behind that the dim countenance of the man whose talk with Jeffreys he had overheard the previous evening.  \"Oh, Mr Julius!\" he howled; \"help me.  Call him off; I shall be torn to pieces.\"  \"And pray how come you to know the name of my dog?\" said Mr Halgrove; \"eh, my little highwayman?\"  \"Please, sir, I'm not a highwayman.  I was only looking for something on the bank.  Oh, Mr Julius!\"  \"My dog is not used to be called Mr,\" replied Mr Halgrove.  \"Oh, I--I thought that was your name,\" whimpered Jonah, not daring to stir an inch for fear of incurring the resentment of the dog.  \"And pray how came you to think my name was Julius?\" said Mr Halgrove, becoming interested.  \"Oh! please sir, wasn't it you that was talking to Jeffreys last night in the minster yard?\"  It was too dark for Jonah to see Mr Halgrove's eyebrows go up at this unexpected question.  \"Julius, come in, sir.  So you know the gentleman I was speaking to yesterday,\" said he, coolly.  \"What did you say his name was?\"  \"Jeffreys, sir.  He's an--\"  Jonah pulled up.  This man, whatever his name was, was Jeffreys' accomplice.  Jonah felt he must not commit himself.  \"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr Halgrove, noticing the abrupt pause.  \"I am saying--it's--it's rather a wet night, sir,\" said Jonah, making a move to walk on.  Mr Halgrove snapped his fingers to Julius, and next instant the wretched Jonah was pinned again to the bank.  \"What did you say he was?\" asked Mr Halgrove, lighting a fusee.  \"Oh, please, sir, please call him off.  My assistant, sir.\"  \"Oh! your assistant--in what?  Highway robbery?\"  \"No, sir.  In teaching a school.  Please, sir, call him off.\"  Mr Halgrove paid no heed to the entreaty, but proceeded to extract numerous particulars as to his ward's conduct and mode of life at Galloway House.  \"So he's taken to minding little boys, has he? and you are his employer? You are aware that you have a treasure of course?\"  Even Trimble was not so dense as to miss the sneer with which the inquiry was made.  It emboldened him considerably.  \"I dislike him; so does ma.  We consider him a dangerous character.\"  Mr Halgrove laughed.  \"What makes you think that?\"  \"There's a--oh, sir, please call off the dog--mystery about him. He's--\"  \"Is that the reason you spied on him yesterday?\"  \"No, sir--that is--\" for at that moment Julius growled--\"yes, sir.  I thought if there was anything wrong it was my duty to the school to know it, sir.\"  \"Exemplary pedagogue!  And now you know it?  Eh?\"  \"Well, sir, I have my suspicions.\"  \"No!  And what might your suspicions be?\"  \"Oh, sir,\" replied the wretched Jonah, feeling like a blue-bottle on a pin, \"I believe he's a murderer in hiding.  I really do.\"  \"Clever little ferret!  You've found that out, have you?\"  \"I feel no doubt about it,\" said Jonah, plucking up a little confidence.  \"Don't feel any.  When and where did the interesting event take place?\"  \"Oh, you could tell me that better than I can tell you,\" stammered Trimble.  \"Indeed!\" said Mr Halgrove, his eyebrows going up ominously in the dark.  \"Of course I shouldn't--that is--I should never dream of getting _you_ into trouble, sir.\"  Mr Halgrove took his cigar out of his mouth and stared at the speaker.  \"I'd wait till you were safe away in America, sir; and even then I wouldn't let your name be known, you know, as an accomplice.\"  Mr Halgrove put his cigar back into his mouth, and changed his cane from his left hand to his right.  \"Fetch him here, Julius,\" said he, stepping back into the middle of the road.  It was in vain the wretched Jonah howled and called for mercy.  \"So you won't let my name be known as an accomplice!  How very kind!\"  And he gave practical proof of his gratitude by caning Jonah till both were tired.  \"Now good-night,\" said Mr Halgrove when he had done, \"and thank you for a pleasant evening.  I dare say Mr Jeffreys will make up for any little deficiencies on my part if you ask him.  Ask him, with my compliments, to show you the little game he played with one of his old school- fellows.  Good-night, Mr Trimble.  Wish him good-night, Julius.\"  Julius once more pinned his affrighted victim to the bank, and then following at his master's heels, left the bruised and bewildered Jonah to limp home as best he could.  The day he had had yesterday had been nothing in comparison with to-day! In the school, meanwhile, there was jubilation and thanksgiving over the fact that Jonah had a bad headache.  Jeffreys, with the first and second classes merged for the occasion into one, amazed Mrs Trimble by the order and industry which he commanded.  \"The young man's worth his money,\" said the good lady, with a sigh of relief, for she had counted on losing her nap for that day at least, and was grateful beyond measure to find her fears disappointed.  As for the first class, they got completely spoiled by their day's change of teacher, and vowed they would all become dunces in order to be put back in the second class.  \"I say, Jeff,\" said Teddy confidentially, as the school was being dismissed, \"_is_ there any chance of his dying?  It's been so ripping to-day without him.\"  \"Hold your tongue, sir,\" said Jeffreys, in a tone which astonished his bloodthirsty young confidant; \"you're old enough to know better than talk like that.\"  Teddy looked very miserable at this rebuke.  \"Don't be in a wax with me, Jeff,\" he said appealingly.  \"Whatever would I do if you got to hate me?\"  Jeffreys was not proof against this, and walked home with his two young friends, beguiling the way with cheery talk, which effectually dispelled the cloud which his passing anger had roused.  On his way back he felt impelled to climb for a moment on the bank at his favourite spot.  It amazed him to see the ground all torn up, and to find a trowel lying half bedded in the turf at the top.  Still more did it surprise and perplex him to find a penknife, which he recognised at once as belonging to Trimble, and which he distinctly recollected having seen in that hero's hand during school the afternoon of the preceding day.  What did it all mean?    CHAPTER NINE.  A THUNDERSTORM.  It did not add to Jonah's happiness to see the looks of evident disgust with which the first class greeted his reappearance in the schoolroom. Their pleasant experience yesterday had demoralised them, and they settled down listlessly at Jonah's bidding like voyagers who, after a day in still waters, put out once more to the rough sea.  Teddy especially felt the hardships of the mighty deep.  Jonah's eye transfixed him all day.  If he spoke, if he fidgeted, if he looked about, the hand of the tyrant swooped down upon him.  He spent the greater part of the day standing on the form.  The contents of his pockets (including some priceless marbles) were impounded; he had two columns of dates to commit to memory before he could go home; and, hardest of all, because of a little blot, he was reduced to the ineffable humiliation of writing all his exercises on a slate!  It took all the big heart of the little fellow to bear up against this mountain of calamity, and had it not been for an occasional glimpse of Jeffreys' face, turned sympathetically in his direction, his courage might have failed him.  School closed, and still his dates were unlearnt.  His legs ached with standing hour after hour on the narrow form, and his head, lifted three feet higher than usual into the heated atmosphere of the room, swam ominously.  Freddy, after waiting about dismally for half an hour, had gone home alone.  The voices of boys remaining to play or talk in the yard outside had one after another ceased.  Jeffreys had long since taken himself and his books elsewhere, and only Jonah was left to keep watch over his prisoner.  The boy made a tremendous effort to master the dates, but they went through him like water through a sieve.  He could not even keep his eyes on the book, and when he turned them towards the master's desk, Jonah seemed to be half hidden in mist.  He edged cautiously to the end of the form nearest the wall, where at least he might get a little support.  It was a perilous voyage, for he was two feet away, and scarcely dare move at a greater rate than an inch a minute.  He got there at last, nearly done up, and with a sigh of relief leaned his head against the cold plaster.  \"Rosher, stand at the other end of the form immediately, and learn twenty more dates for being idle.\"  Alas poor Teddy!  He had held out long, and braved much.  But his heart quailed now.  He seemed glued to the wall, and the form all of a sudden seemed to contract into a tight-rope over a chasm.  \"I'm so tired, sir, I--\"  \"Silence, sir! and do what you're told,\" thundered Jonah.  Teddy staggered forward half a step, but shrank back before he had finished it to the friendly wall.  Trimble rose from his seat.  \"Do you hear me?\" he shouted furiously.  \"Stand where I tell you.\"  \"Please, sir, I can't.  I--\"  Here Trimble advanced towards him, and Teddy, fairly unnerved and almost fainting, slipped down from the bench and burst into tears.  \"That's it, is it?\" said Jonah; \"we'll see whether you can or--\"  At that instant the door opened, and Jeffreys entered the room.  It did not require the boy's sobbing appeal, \"Oh, Jeff, Jeff!\" to enable him to take in the situation at a glance.  Nor did it need a second glance at the face of the intruder to induce Jonah to turn pale.  Jeffreys advanced without a word to the form, brushing Jonah out of his way with a swing that sent him staggering six paces down the floor, and putting his arm round Teddy, led him without a word from the room.  \"Come along, little chap,\" said he, when they got outside; \"come home.\"  The sound of his voice revived Teddy like a cordial.  \"Do you hate me for blubbering?\" he asked anxiously; \"wasn't it like a baby?\"  \"How long had you been up there?\" asked Jeffreys.  \"It was half-past one when he stood me up.  I had only just been looking round to see where Freddy was; and oh, Jeff, I've got to write on a slate just because of a little blot.  What's the time now?\"  \"Half-past five,\" said Jeffreys, putting on his hat, and swinging Teddy's satchel over his own arm.  \"Are you coming with me Jeff?\" asked the boy eagerly.  \"Of course you couldn't get home alone.\"  Great was the content of the little fellow as he left Galloway House with his hand on the strong arm of his tutor.  Greater still were his surprise and content when, as soon as the streets were past, Jeffreys took him up on his back and carried him the rest of the way to Ash Cottage.  \"Thanks, awfully, old Jeff,\" said the boy, as they parted at the gate of the cottage.  \"What makes you so kind to Freddy and me?\"  \"I'm not good at riddles, Teddy.  Good-night,\" and he went.  Jonah, as he was not surprised to find, was expecting him, in a state of high ferment.  Jeffreys would fain have avoided an interview.  For he was constantly discovering that he was still far from sure of himself. That afternoon his passion had been within an ace of mastering him; and at any time he dreaded something might happen which would undo all the penance of those last six months.  He therefore resolved wisely in the present instance to avoid altercation as far as possible.  \"Well, sir, and what have you got to say for yourself?  Where have you been?\" demanded Jonah, in tones of lofty bitterness.  \"I have just taken Rosher home.  After standing four hours on the form he wasn't fit to walk himself.\"  \"Oh!\" snorted Jonah, nearly bursting with indignation; \"and pray how--\"  \"Excuse me, Trimble.  If you and Mrs Trimble wish me to leave, I'll do so.  If not, don't talk to me.  I don't want it.\"  Poor Jonah nearly had a fit.  He, head man of Galloway House, knowing what he did, to be spoken to like this by a stuck-up--murderer!  He had prepared a scene, and had counted on coming to an understanding then and there.  And lo and behold! before he had well opened his mouth, he had been ordered to shut it by the very being whom he had at his mercy.  It passed Jonah's comprehension.  Jeffreys waited a minute to give him a chance of accepting his former alternative.  Then, concluding he had decided on the latter, he betook himself to his own room and remained there.  Jonah, as soon as he could recover himself sufficiently to think at all, made up his mind that, come what would, he had had enough of this sort of life.  With which conviction he crushed his hat on his head, and sallied forth into the open air.  His feet almost instinctively turned in the direction of Ash Lane; but on this occasion they went past the fatal bank and brought their owner to a halt at the door of Ash Cottage.  \"Is Mr Rosher at home?\" inquired he of the servant.  Mr Rosher was at home--a jovial, well-to-do farmer, with a hearty Yorkshire voice and a good-humoured grin on his broad face.  \"Well, lad, what is't?\" he asked, as Trimble, hat in hand, was shown into the little parlour.  \"Man, it's the little school-maister.\"  \"Yes, Mr Rosher,\" said Trimble; \"I should like five minutes' talk with you if you can spare the time.\"  \"Blaze away, lad.  A've nothin' else to do.\"  \"I'm rather anxious about your two dear little boys,\" began Trimble.  \"Thee needn't be that; they're tight lads, and learn quite fast enough.\"  \"It's not that, Mr Rosher, though I hope they do justice to the pains we take with them.\"  \"They nearly killed their mother t'other day on the tricycle,\" said Mr Rosher, laughing like a young bull.  \"Was't thee or t'other young chap came to mend t'auld bone-shaker?  Twas a kindly turn to the little fellows, and I'm sorry thee didn't stay to tea, lad.\"  \"We always like to try to make them happy,\" said Jonah.  \"Indeed, that is what I came to see you about.  I'm sorry to say--\"  \"Thee's come to tell me why Teddy was blubbering when he got home. Thee'd better tell that to his mother,\" said the father.  \"I'm so sorry to say,\" pursued Jonah, beginning to wish he was over his task, \"my assistant-master is disappointing me.  I took him on half in charity six months ago, but lately he has been having a bad influence in the school, and I thought it, my duty--\"  \"Tut, tut!  The lads have been cheerier this last six months than ever before--\"  \"Of course we try all we can to make them happy, and shield them from harm,\" pursued Trimble, \"and I am glad you think we have made school happy for them--\"  \"And is that all thee's come to say?\" said the bewildered parent.  \"No, sir.  Of course in school I can look after the boys and see they come to no harm; but after school hours of course they are out of my control, and then it is I'm afraid of their coming to mischief.  My assistant, I hear, has been in the habit of walking home with them, and from what I know of him he is not a desirable companion for them, and I think it is my duty to put you on your guard, Mr Rosher.  They should not be encouraged to see too much of him out of doors or bring him to the house.\"  \"It bothers me why you keep the man if he's that sort!\" said Mr Rosher. \"What's wrong with him?\"  \"I'm afraid he's a bad character.  I have only discovered it lately, and intend to dismiss him as soon as I get a new assistant.\"  \"What dost mean by a bad character?  Is he a thief?\"  Trimble looked very grave.  \"I wish it was no worse than that.\"  The farmer's jaw dropped.  \"What?\" said he.  \"Dost mean to tell me the man's a murderer?\"  Jonah looked terribly shocked.  \"It's a dreadful thing to suspect any one,\" said he, \"but it would not be right of me to let things go on without warning you.  I shall keep your boys under my own eyes all school-time; and I advise you--\"  \"I don't want thy advice.  Take thyself off!\"  Jonah saw that to prolong the interview would only make matters worse. The good father was evidently roused; but whether against him, Jonah, or against Jeffreys, he could scarcely tell.  He departed decidedly crestfallen, and more than half repenting of his amiable expedition.  His misgivings were somewhat relieved next morning when Freddy and Teddy put in an appearance punctually at school-time.  Jonah considered it expedient under the circumstances not to refer to Teddy's mutinous conduct on the preceding day--a determination which afforded great comfort to that young gentleman and which he put down by a mysterious process of reasoning to Jeffreys' good offices on his behalf.  Jonah, however, on this particular morning felt far from comfortable. It may have been the hot sultry day, or it may have been the general oppression of his own feelings, which gave him a sense of something-- probably a thunderstorm impending.  His class remarked that he was less exacting than usual, and even Jeffreys became aware that his colleague for once in a way was not himself.  The clock had just struck twelve, and the boys were beginning to look forward to their usual break in half an hour's time, when the schoolroom door suddenly opened, and disclosed the broad figure of Mr Rosher, followed at a timid distance by Mrs Trimble.  Jonah's face turned pale; Freddy and Teddy opened their eyes to their widest.  Jeffreys, on hearing Freddy mutter \"Father,\" looked round curiously, to get a view of the father of his little friends.  Mr Rosher recognised Trimble with a nod.  \"I've coom, you see, lad.  I want to have a look at this murderer fellow thee was talking about.  Where is he?\"  It was a thunderclap with a vengeance!  Only two persons in the room guessed all it meant.  \"Coom, trot him out, man,\" repeated the farmer, noticing the hesitation in Jonah's scared face.  \"Is that the chap yonder thee was telling me of?\" added he, pointing to Jeffreys.  It was all up with Galloway House, and Jonah knew it.  \"Yes,\" said he.  Jeffrey's face became livid as he sprang to his feet.  \"Stay where thou art,\" said the brawny farmer, motioning him back. \"Let's have a look at thee.  So thee's a manslayer?  Thou looks it.\"  A terrible pause followed--the pause of a man who struggles for words that will not come.  He looked terrible indeed; with heaving chest and bloodless lips, and eyes like the eyes of a hunted wolf.  At length he gasped--  \"Liar!\" and advanced towards the affrighted Jonah.  But the sturdy Yorkshire-man stepped between.  \"Nay, nay,\" said he, \"one's enough.  Stay where thou art, and let him give chapter and verse--chapter and verse.  He came to me last night, and said thou wast a murderer, and I've coom to see if thou art.  Thou looks one, but maybe thou'rt right to call him a liar.\"  \"Ask him,\" gasped Jonah, \"what he did to his old schoolfellow, young Forrester, and then lot him call me a liar if he likes.\"  \"Dost hear, lad?  What was it thee did to thy old schoolfellow young Forrester?  That's a fair question.  Out with it.\"  If Jeffreys had looked terrible a moment ago, he looked still more terrible now, as he sank with a groan onto the bench, and turned a sickened look on his accuser.  The dead silence of the room almost stunned him.  He seemed to feel every eye that turned to him like a dagger in his heart, and there rose up in his mind a vision of that football field far away, and the senseless figure of the boy who lay there.  Everything came back.  The howl of execration, the frightened faces, the cap lying where the boy had flung it, even the chill autumn breeze in his face.  He knew not how long he sat there stupefied.  The voice of Mr Rosher roused him.  \"Coom, now, dost thou say liar still?\"  Jeffreys struggled to his feet, no longer furious, but still more terrible in his dejection.  \"Yes,\" snapped Jonah, astonished at the effect of his accusation, and just wise enough to see that to add to or take away from the story would be to spoil it.  \"What did you do to your poor schoolfellow, young Forrester?  Do you suppose we don't see through you?\"  \"Hold thy tongue, little donkey!\" said the farmer; \"let's hear what he has to say.\"  For a moment it seemed as if Jeffreys was about to take him at his word, and say something.  But his tongue failed him at the critical moment, and he gave it up.  He had caught sight of Teddy's eyes fixed on his in mingled misery and terror, and the sight unmanned him.  He moved slowly to the door.  They watched him, spellbound, and in a moment he would have gone, had not Teddy with a big sob made a spring forward and seized him by the arm.  \"Oh, Jeff it's a wicked he; we don't believe it.  Freddy, we don't believe it, do we?  Father, he's been good to us; he never did anything unkind.  Don't have him sent away!\"  This appeal fairly broke the spell.  Freddy was at his brother's side in an instant, and the rest of the school, had not Mr Rosher motioned them back, would have followed him.  \"Teddy and Freddy, my lads,\" said the farmer, \"go to thy seats like good lads.  Let him say yea or nay to what this--little--peacher says.\"  \"Say you didn't, Jeff,\" implored the boys.  Jeffreys shook his head sadly.  \"I can't,\" he said.  \"If he's dead--\"  \"Oh, he's dead,\" put in Jonah; \"I can tell you that.\"  Jeffreys gave one scared look at the speaker, and then hurried from the room.  Mrs Trimble followed him up to his room.  \"I don't believe it all,\" said she; \"you never did it on purpose, you're not so bad as that.  I won't believe it even if you tell me,\" said the good lady, bursting into tears.  Jeffreys put together his few books and garments.  \"You're going,\" said she, \"of course.  It's no use hoping you won't. Here's two pounds you're owed--and--\"  Jeffreys took the money, and kept her hand for a moment in his.  \"You are kind,\" said he hoarsely.  \"Good-bye, Mrs Trimble.\"  He kissed her hand and took up his bundle.  At the foot of the stairs a boy's hand was laid on his arm.  \"Oh, Jeff,\" whispered Teddy--he had stolen out of the schoolroom.  \"Poor Jeff!  I know you aren't wicked.  Say good-bye, Jeff.  What shall we do? What shall we do?\"  \"Good-bye, little chap,\" said Jeffreys, stooping down and kissing the boy's wet cheek.  \"But, Jeff, where are you going?  When will you--?\"  Jeffreys was gone.  In the schoolroom meanwhile the inevitable reaction had taken place.  As the door closed behind Jeffreys, Jonah, hardly knowing what he did, gave vent to a hysterical laugh.  It was the signal for an explosion such as he had little counted on.  \"Thou little dirty toad!\" said the farmer, rounding on him wrathfully; \"what dost mean by that?  Hey?  For shame!\"  \"Beast!\" shouted Freddy, choking with anger and misery.  \"Beast!\" echoed the school.  Some one threw a wet sponge across the room, but Mr Rosher intercepted it.  \"Nay, nay, lads; don't waste your clean things on him.  Freddy and Teddy, my lads--where's Teddy?--come along home.  You've done with Galloway House.\"  \"Why, sir--\" expostulated the wretched Jonah.  \"Hold thy tongue again,\" roared the farmer.  \"Coom away, lads.  Thee can take a half-holiday to-day, all of you, and if thy parents ask why, say Farmer Rosher will tell them.\"  \"I'll have you prosecuted,\" growled Trimble, \"for interfering with my--\"  \"Dost want to be shut up in yon cupboard?\" roared the hot-headed farmer. And the hint was quite enough.  Galloway House on that day turned a corner.  Farmer Rosher, who had sore doubts in his own mind whether he had done good or harm by his interference, spoke his mind freely to his neighbours on the subject of Jonah Trimble, a proceeding in which his two sons heartily backed him up.  The consequence was that that worthy young pedagogue found his scholastic labours materially lightened--for a dozen boys are easier to teach than fifty--and had time to wonder whether after all he would not have served his day and generation quite as well by looking after his own affairs, as after the most unprofitable affairs of somebody else.    CHAPTER TEN.  TOSSED ABOUT.  Jeffreys, as the reader will have discovered, did not possess the art of doing himself common justice.  He had brooded so long and so bitterly over his fatal act of violence at Bolsover, that he had come almost to forget that accident had had anything to do with poor Forrester's injuries.  And now, when confronted with his crime, even by a despicable wretch like Trimble, he had not the spirit to hold up his head and make some effort at any rate to clear himself of all that was charged against him.  Jeffreys was still a blunderer, or else his conscience was unusually sensitive.  You and I, reader, no doubt, would have put a bold face on the matter, and insisted the whole affair was entirely an accident, and that we were to be pitied rather than blamed for what had happened.  And a great many people would have pitied us accordingly.  But Jeffreys claimed no pity.  He saw nothing but his own ruthless fault; and he chose to take the whole burden of it, and the burden of the accident besides, on his own shoulders.  And so it was he left Galloway House without a word, and cast himself and his bad name once more adrift on a pitiless world.  But as he walked on he was not thinking of Galloway House, or Farmer Rosher, or Freddy or Teddy.  The last words of Trimble rang in his ears, and deafened him to all beside.  \"He's dead--_I_ can tell you that!\"  It never occurred to him to wonder whence Jonah had derived his information, or whether it was true or false.  Mr Brampton's letter five months ago had left little hope of the boy's recovery, but not till now had Jeffreys heard any one say, in so many words \"He is dead.\"  Jonah apparently knew the whole story.  How he had discovered it, it was useless to guess.  And yet for a moment Jeffreys was tempted to return and seize his accuser by the throat and demand the truth of him.  But he dismissed the notion with a shudder.  His steps turned, half mechanically, half by chance, towards his guardian's house.  He had never been in that quarter of York since the night of his expulsion, and he did not know why of all places he should just now turn thither.  His guardian, as he well knew, was even more pitiless and cynical than ever, and any hope of finding shelter or rest under his roof he knew to be absurd.  He might, however, be out; indeed, he had spoken of going to America, in which case Mrs Jessop might be there alone.  One clings to the idea of a home; and this place, such as it was, was the only place which for Jeffreys had ever had any pretensions to the blessed name.  His expectations--if he had any--vanished as he abruptly turned the corner of the street and stood in front of the house.  The shutters on the lower floor were closed, and the windows above were curtainless and begrimed with dust.  A notice \"To let,\" stared out from a board beside the front door, and the once cosy little front garden was weed-grown and run to seed.  Jeffreys felt a stronger man as he walked out of York in the deepening twilight.  He was in the way of old associations just now, for almost without knowing it he found himself quitting York by way of Ash Lane, every step of which by this time was familiar--painfully familiar ground.  The bank on which he had last found Jonah's knife had now new attractions for him.  Not so a garden shed, by the back of which he passed, and whence proceeded the glimmer of a light, and the sound of boys' voices.  He could not help standing a moment, and motioning Julius close to his heels, listening.  \"It's broken worse than ever now,\" said Freddy.  \"It's no use trying to mend it.\"  \"Jeff could have done it.  I say, Freddy, whatever did father mean?\"  \"I don't know.  All I know is I'll never forget dear old Jeff; shall you?\"  \"Rather not.  I'm going to pray for him once a day, Freddy.\"  \"All serene--so shall I.\"  Jeffreys stole one hurried glance through the cracked timbers, and then walked away quickly and with a heart brim full.  Whenever in after days his soul needed music, he had only to call up the voices of those two little fellows in the shed as he last heard them. Little heeded they what came of their childish words.  Little heeded they that they were helping to make a true man of the Jeff they loved, and that whatever true strength he came to possess for fighting life's battles and bearing life's burdens, he owed it beyond any one to them!  He walked on rapidly and steadily for two hours, until the last lingering glow of the summer light had faded from the sky, and the lights of York behind him were lost in the night.  A field of new-mown hay provided him with the most luxurious bedroom man could desire.  The thought uppermost in his mind when he awoke next morning was young Forrester.  He felt that it would be useless for him to attempt anything or hope for anything till he had ascertained whatever was to be known respecting the boy's fate.  Trimble's words, which rang in his ears, had a less positive sound about them.  At least he would find out for himself whether they were true or false.  Grangerham, the small country town in which he had ascertained Forrester lived, and to which he had been removed from Bolsover, was far enough away from York.  Jeffreys had many a time sought it out on the map, and speculated on how it was to be reached, should a summons arrive to call him thither.  It was seventy miles away as the crow flies.  Jeffreys had the way there by heart.  He knew what time the trains left York, what were the junctions along the line, and how far the nearest railway station would take him to his journey's end.  Now, however, it was a question of walking, not riding.  The two pounds in his pocket, all he possessed, scarcely seemed his at all as long as Mr Frampton's school bill was unsettled.  At any rate, it was too precious to squander in railway fares for a man who could walk for nothing.  It was a long, harassing journey, over moors and along stony roads.  It was not till the evening of the second day that the footsore traveller read on a sign-post the welcome words, \"Four miles to Grangerham.\"  He had eaten little and rested little on the way, and during the last twelve hours a broiling sun had beaten down pitilessly upon him.  If the journey of the two last days had been exhausting, the fruitless search of the day that followed was fully as wearisome.  Grangerham was a pretty big manufacturing town, and Jeffreys' heart sank within him as soon as he entered it.  For who among these busy crowds would be likely to know anything of an invalid old lady and her cripple grandson?  In vain he enquired in street after street for Mrs Forrester's address. Some had not heard the name.  Some knew a public-house kept by one Tony Forrester.  Some recollected an old lady who used to keep a costermonger's stall and had a baby with fits.  Others, still more tantalising, began by knowing all about it, and ended by showing that they knew nothing.  At the police-office they looked at him hard, and demanded what he wanted with anybody of the name of Forrester.  At the post-office they told him curtly they could not tell him anything unless he could give the old lady's address.  At length, late in the day, he ventured to knock at the door of the clergyman of that part of the town in which the only few residents' houses seemed to be, and to repeat his question there.  The clergyman, a hard-working man who visited a hundred families in a week, at first returned the same answer as everybody else.  No, he did not know any one of that name.  \"Stay,\" he said; \"perhaps you mean old Mrs Wilcox.\"  Jeffreys groaned.  Everybody had been suggesting the name of some old lady to him different from the one he wanted.  \"She had a nephew, I think, who was a cripple.  The poor fellow had had an accident at school, so I heard.  I almost think he died.  I never saw him myself, but if you come with me, I'll take you to the Wesleyan minister.  I think he knows Mrs Wilcox.\"  Thankful for any clue, however slight, Jeffreys accompanied the good man to the Wesleyan minister.  \"Mrs Wilcox--ah, yes,\" said the latter, when his brother pastor had explained their errand.  \"She died in Torquay five months ago.  She was a great sufferer.\"  \"And her nephew?\" inquired the clergyman.  \"Her grandson, you mean.\"  Jeffreys' heart leapt.  \"What was his name?\" he asked, excitedly.  \"Forrester; a dear young fellow he was.  His mother, who died out in India, was Mrs Wilcox's only daughter.  Yes, poor Gerard Forrester was brought home from school about six months ago terribly crippled by an accident.  It was said one of his school-fellows had--\"  \"But where is he now? tell me, for mercy's sake!\" exclaimed Jeffreys.  \"I cannot tell you that,\" replied the minister.  \"His grandmother was ordered to Torquay almost as soon as he arrived home.  He remained here about a month in charge of his old nurse; and then--\"  \"He's not dead!\" almost shouted Jeffreys.  \"Then,\" continued the minister, \"when the news came of his grandmother's death, they left Grangerham.  From all I can hear, Mrs Wilcox died very poor.  I believe the nurse intended to try to get him taken into a hospital somewhere; but where or how I never knew.  I was away in London when they disappeared, and have never heard of them since.\"  \"Isn't his father alive?\"  \"Yes.  I wrote to him by Mrs Wilcox's request.  He is an officer in India in the Hussars.  I have had no reply, and cannot be sure that the letter has reached him, as I see that his regiment has been dispatched to Afghanistan.\"  \"Did you never hear from the nurse?\" asked Jeffreys.  \"Never.\"  \"And was it thought Forrester would recover?\"  \"I believe it was thought that if he got special treatment in a hospital his life might be spared.\"  This then was all Jeffreys could hear.  Jonah Trimble might be right after all.  How he abused himself for flying from York as he had done without extracting the truth first!  It was too late now.  He begged to be taken to see the house where Forrester lived.  It was occupied by a new tenant, and all he could do was to pace up and down in front of it, in a lonely vigil, and try to imagine the pale face which only a few months back had gazed wearily from those windows on the active life without, in which he was never more to take a share.  He had not the courage to wait that night in Grangerham, although the minister urged him and Julius, tramps as they were, to do so.  He felt stifled in these narrow streets, and longed for the fresh heath, where at least he could be alone.  He accepted, however, the hospitality of his guide for half an hour in order to write a short note to Mr Frampton.  He said:--  \"I have come here hoping to hear something of Forrester.  But I can hear nothing more than what you told me four months ago.  He has left here in charge of his old nurse, and has not been heard of since.  You will wonder why I have left York.  The story of what happened at Bolsover reached the ears of my employer's son.  He accused me of it before all the school, and added that he knew Forrester was dead.  I could not stand it, and came away--though I feel now I was foolish not to ascertain first how he had learned what you and I have not yet been able to hear.  It is too terrible to believe! and I cannot believe it till I find out for myself.  Where I shall go next I do not know, and feel I do not care.  My guardian has left York.  I saw him two days before I came away, and he told me then he should refuse to pay my last half-term's bill, which came to 7.  I enclose thirty shillings now--all I have; and you may depend on my sending the rest as soon as I can earn it; for I shall be miserable as long as I owe a farthing to Bolsover.\"  Having written this dismal letter, and having posted it with its enclosure, he bade farewell to Grangerham, and wandered forth with the sympathetic Julius out on to the quiet heath, and there lay down--not to sleep, but to think.    CHAPTER ELEVEN.  WILDTREE TOWERS.  Jeffreys spoke truly when he wrote to Mr Frampton that he did not know and did not care where he was going next.  When he awoke in his heathery bed next morning, he lay indolently for a whole hour for no other reason than because he did not know whether to walk north, south, east or west. He lacked the festive imagination which helps many people under similar circumstances.  It did not occur to him to toss up, nor was he aware of the value of turning round three times with his eyes closed and then marching straight before him.  Had he been an errant knight, of course his horse would have settled the question; but as it was, he was not a knight and had not a horse.  He had a dog, though.  He had found Julius in possession of the caretaker at his guardian's house, and had begged her to let him have him.  \"Which way are we going, Julius?\" inquired the dog's master, leaning upon his elbow, and giving no sign which the dog could possibly construe into a suggestion.  Julius was far too deep an animal not to see through an artless design like this.  But for all that he undertook the task of choosing.  He rose from his bed, shook himself, rubbed a few early flies off his face, and then, taking up the bundle in his teeth, with a rather contemptuous sniff, walked sedately off, in the direction of the North Pole. Jeffreys dutifully followed; and thus it was that one of the most momentous turns in his life was taken in the footsteps of a dog.  Let us leave him, reader, tramping aimlessly thus o'er moor and fell, and hill and dale, leaving behind him the smoke of the cotton country and the noisy shriek of the railway, and losing himself among the lonely valleys and towering hills of Westmoreland--let us leave him, footsore, hungry, and desponding, and refresh ourselves in some more cheery scene and amidst livelier company.  Where shall we go? for we can go anywhere.  That's one of the few little privileges of the storyteller.  Suppose, for instance, we take farewell of humble life altogether for a while, and invite ourselves into some grand mansion, where not by the remotest possibility could Jeffreys or Jeffreys' affairs be of the very slightest interest.  What do you say to this tempting-looking mansion, marked in the map as Wildtree Towers, standing in a park of I should not like to say how many acres, on the lower slopes of one of the grandest mountains in the Lake country?  On the beautiful summer afternoon on which we first see it, it certainly looks one of the fairest spots in creation.  As we stand on the doorstep, the valley opens out before us, stretching far to the south, and revealing reaches of lake and river, broad waving meadows and clustering villages, wild crags and pine-clad fells.  We, however, do not stand on the doorstep to admire the view, or even to ask admission.  We have the storyteller's latchkey and invisible cap. Let us enter.  As we stand in the great square hall, hung round in baronial style with antlers, and furnished in all the luxury of modern comfort, wondering through which of the dozen doors that open out of the square it would be best worth our while to penetrate, a footman, bearing a tray with afternoon tea, flits past us.  Let us follow him, for afternoon tea means that living creatures are at hand.  We find ourselves in a snug little boudoir, furnished and decorated with feminine skill and taste, and commanding through the open French windows a gorgeous view down the valley.  Two ladies, one middle-aged, one young, are sitting there as the footman enters.  The elder, evidently the mistress of the mansion, is reading a newspaper; the younger is dividing her time between needlework and looking rather discontentedly out of the window.  It is quite evident the two are not mother and child.  There is not the slightest trace of resemblance between the handsome aquiline face of the elder, stylishly-dressed woman, and the rounder and more sensitive face of her quietly-attired companion.  Nor is there much in common between the frank eyes and mock-demure mouth of the girl, and the half- imperious, half-worried look of her senior.  \"Tell Mr Rimbolt, Walker,\" says the mistress, as she puts down her paper, and moves her chair up to the tea-table, \"and Master Percy.\"  A handsome gentleman, just turning grey, with an intellectual and good- humoured face, strolls into the room in response to Walker's summons.  \"I was positively nearly asleep,\" he says; \"the library gets more than its share of the afternoon sun.\"  \"It would be better for you, dear, if you took a drive or a walk, instead of shutting yourself up with your old books.\"  The gentleman laughs pleasantly, and puts some sugar in his tea.  \"You are not very respectful to my old friends,\" said he.  \"You forget how long we've been parted.  Where's Percy?\"  \"Walker has gone to tell him.\"  \"I think he is out,\" said the young lady; \"he told me he was going down to the river.\"  \"I consider,\" said Mrs Rimbolt rather severely, \"he should tell _me_ what he is going to do, not you.\"  \"But, aunt, I didn't ask him.  He volunteered it.\"  \"Fetch your uncle's cup, Raby.\"  Raby's mouth puckers up into a queer little smile as she obeys.  Walker appears in a minute to confirm the report of Master Percy's absence.  \"He's been gone this three hours, mem.\"  \"Let some one go for him at once, Walker.\"  \"I get so terrified when he goes off like this,\" says the mother; \"there's no knowing what may happen, and he is so careless.\"  \"He has a safe neck,\" replies the father; \"he always does turn up.  But if you are so fidgety, why don't you send Raby to look after him?\"  \"If any one went with him, it would need to be some one who, instead of encouraging him in his odd ways, would keep him in hand, and see he did not come to any harm.\"  \"Oh,\" says Raby, laughing, \"he wouldn't take me with him if I paid him a hundred pounds.  He says girls don't know anything about science and inventions.\"  \"He is probably right,\" observes Mrs Rimbolt severely.  \"Certainly, as regards the science _he_ practises,\" says her husband. \"What was it he had in hand last week?  Some invention for making people invisible by painting them with invisible paint?  Ha! ha!  He invited me to let him try it on me.\"  \"He _did_ try it on me,\" chimes in Raby.  \"It is nothing to laugh about,\" says the mother; \"it is much better for him to be of an inquiring turn of mind than--idle,\" adds she, looking significantly at her niece's empty hand.  \"It strikes me it is we who are of an inquiring turn of mind just now,\" said the father.  \"I fancy he'll turn up.  He generally does. Meanwhile, I will go and finish my writing.\"  And he politely retires.  \"Raby, my dear,\" says Mrs Rimbolt--Raby always knows what is coming when a sentence begins thus--\"Raby, my dear, it does not sound nice to hear you making fun of your cousin.  Percy is very good to you--\"  \"Oh yes!\" interrupts Raby, almost enthusiastically.  \"Which makes it all the less nice on your part to make a laughing-stock of him in the presence of his own father.  It may seem unlikely that people should be rendered invisible--\"  Mrs Rimbolt stops, conscious she is about to talk nonsense, and Raby gallantly covers her retreat.  \"I'm sure I wish I knew half what he does about all sorts of things.\"  \"I wish so too,\" replies the aunt, severely and ungratefully.  Several hours pass, and still Master Percy does not put in an appearance.  As Mrs Rimbolt's uneasiness increases, half a dozen servants are sent out in various directions to seek the prodigal.  It is an almost daily ceremony, and the huntsmen set about their task as a matter of course.  No one can recollect an occasion on which Master Percy has ever come home at the right time without being looked for.  If the appointed hour is four, every one feels well treated if his honour turns up at five.  Nor, with the exception of his mother, and now and then Raby, does any one dream of becoming agitated for three or four hours later.  When therefore, just as the family is sitting down to dinner at half- past six, Walker enters radiant to announce that Master Percy has come in, no one thinks any more about his prolonged absence, and one or two of the servants outside say to one another that the young master must be hungry to come home at this virtuous hour.  This surmise is probably correct, for Percy presents himself in a decidedly dishevelled condition, his flannel costume being liberally bespattered with mud, and his hair very much in need of a brush and comb.  You cannot help liking the boy despite the odd, self-willed solemnity of his face.  He is between fourteen and fifteen apparently, squarely built, with his mother's aquiline features and his father's strong forehead.  The year he has spent at Rugby has redeemed him from being a lout, but it is uncertain whether it has done anything more.  The master of his house has been heard to predict that the boy would either live to be hanged or to become a great man.  Some of his less diplomatic school- fellows had predicted both things, and when at the end of a year he refused point blank to return to school, and solemnly assured his father that if he was sent back he should run away on the earliest opportunity, it was generally allowed that for a youth of his age he had some decided ideas of his own.  The chief fault about him, say some, is that he has too many ideas of his own, and tries to run them all together.  But we are digressing, and keeping him from his dinner.  \"My dear boy, where have you been?\" says the mother; \"we have been looking for you everywhere.\"  \"Oh, out!\" replies Percy, hastily taking stock of the bill of fare.  \"Well, run and dress yourself, or dinner will be cold.\"  \"I'm too fagged,\" says Percy, coolly taking a seat.  \"Some soup, please.\"  \"I can't have you sit down in that state, Percy,\" says Mr Rimbolt; \"it is not polite to your mother and Raby.\"  \"If the poor boy is tired,\" says Mrs Rimbolt, \"we must excuse him this once.\"  So Mr Rimbolt, as has happened more than once before, gives in, and Percy does as he pleases.  He does full justice to his dinner, and takes no part in the conversation, which is chiefly carried on by Mr Rimbolt, sometimes with his wife, sometimes with Raby.  At length, however, the first cravings of appetite being subdued, he shows a readiness to put in his oar.  \"How goes the invisible paint, Percy?\" asks his father, with a twinkle in his eye.  \"Used up,\" replies the boy solemnly.  \"I'm sure it would answer.  I painted Hodge with it, and could scarcely see him at all from a distance.\"  \"I believe you paint yourself,\" says Raby, laughing, \"and that's why the men can't find you.\"  Percy is pleased at this, and takes it as a recognition of his genius. He has great faith in his own discovery, and it is everything to him to find some one else believing in it too.  \"If you like to come to the river to-morrow, I'll show you something,\" says he condescendingly.  \"It licks the paint into fits!\"  \"Raby will be busy in the village to-morrow,\" says her aunt.  \"What is it you are doing at the river?\"  \"Oh, ah!\" solemnly responds the son, whose year at a public-school has not taught him the art of speaking respectfully to his parents; \"wouldn't you like to know?\"  \"I wish you'd play somewhere else, dear.  It makes me so uneasy when you are down by the river.\"  \"Play!\" says Percy rather scornfully; \"I don't play there--I work!\"  \"I fear you are neglecting one sort of work for another, my boy,\" says Mr Rimbolt; \"we never got through Virgil yet, you know--at least, you didn't.  I've been through three books since you deserted our readings.\"  \"Oh, Virgil's jolly enough,\" replied the boy; \"I'm going to finish it as soon as my experiments are over.\"  \"What experiments?\"  \"Oh, it's a dodge to--I'd show it you as soon as it's finished.  It's nearly done now, and it will be a tremendous tip.\"  This is all that can be extracted from the youthful man of science--at least, by the elders.  To Raby, when the family retires to the drawing- room, the boy is more confidential, and she once more captivates him by entering heart and soul into his project and entreating to be made a party in the experiments.  \"I'd see,\" says he; \"but mind you don't go chattering!\"  Mr Rimbolt gravitates as usual to his library, and here it is that half an hour later his son presents himself, still in his working garb.  \"Father,\" says the hopeful, \"please can you give me some money?\"  \"Why, you have had ten shillings a week since you came home!\"  \"Aren't you a millionaire, father?\"  \"Some people say so.\"  \"Doesn't that mean you've got a million pounds?\"  \"That's what `millionaire' means.\"  \"Ten shillings a week is only twenty-six pounds a year.\"  \"Quite right, and few boys get such good pocket-money.\"  \"When I come into the property I shall allow my son more than that,\" says Percy gravely.  \"Not if you love him as much as I love my son,\" says Mr Rimbolt, with a pleasant smile.  \"Good-night, father.\"  \"Good-night!  Why, it's only half-past seven.\"  \"I know.  I'm going to _get_ up early; I've got a lot of work to do. Besides, I'm miserable.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Because I can't get any money.\"  \"Why not earn some?  I want some one to catalogue my books for me.  What do you say to doing it?  I shall pay half a crown a shelf.\"  Percy hesitates a bit, and looks at the bookcases, and makes a mental calculation.  \"That will be about twelve pounds, won't it?  Have you got a book to write the names on?\"  \"What!  Are you going to begin now?\"  \"Yes.\"  And Percy sits up till eleven o'clock, and succeeds in that time in cataloguing after a fashion, and not badly for a first attempt, two of the smallest shelves in the library, for which he receives then and there five shillings, much to his own comfort and to his father's amusement.  Mrs Rimbolt comes into the library just as the business is concluded.  \"Why, Percy, not in bed--and so tired too!\"  \"Oh, I've been doing some work for father,\" says the boy, chinking the two half-crowns in his pocket.  \"But your father, I'm sure, would not wish you to injure your health.\"  \"Certainly not.  Percy was hard up, and has just been earning five shillings.\"  \"What do you mean--earning five shillings?\"  \"Yes--father's been tipping me for cataloguing his books.  Jolly hard work, but he pays on the nail, don't you, father?\"  \"My dear boy,\" said the mother, as she and her son walks across the hall, \"why did you not tell me you wanted money?  You know I do not grudge it.  I don't like you to stay up so late to earn it, when you ought to be resting.\"  \"Well, I wouldn't mind another five shillings, mother.\"  The mother gives him a half-sovereign and kisses him.  Percy, as he walks up the stairs, ruminating on his good luck, feels considerably more self-respect when he looks at the two half-crowns than when looking at the half-sovereign.  At the top of the stairs he shouts down to Walker:--  \"I say, wake me at six, will you? and leave my waterproof and top-boots on the hall table; and, I say, tell Mason to cut me a dozen strong ash sticks about a yard long; and, I say, leave a hammer and some tacks on the hall table too; and tell Appleby to go by the early coach to Overstone and get me a pound of cork, and some whalebone, and some tar. Here's five shillings to pay for them.  Don't forget.  Tell him to leave them at the lodge before twelve, and I'll fetch them.  Oh, and tell Raby if she wants to see what I was telling her about, she had better hang about the lodge till I come.  I'm sure to be there somewhere between twelve and four.\"  With which the young lord of creation retires to his cubicle, leaving Walker scratching his head, and regarding the five shillings in his hand in anything but a joyful mood.  \"He ought to be put on the treadmill a week or two; that's what would do him good,\" observed the sage retainer to himself; \"one thing at a time, and plenty of it.  A dozen ash sticks before six o'clock in the morning! What does he want with ash sticks?  Now his schoolmaster, if he'd got one, would find them particular handy.\"  With which little joke Walker goes off to agitate Appleby and Mason with the news of their early morning duties, and to put the servants' hall in a flutter by announcing for the fiftieth time that summer that either he or the young master would have to leave Wildtree Towers, because, positively--well, they would understand--a man's respect for himself demanded that he should draw the line somewhere, and that was just what Master Percy would not allow him to do.  We have changed the scene once already in this chapter.  Just before we finish let us change it once more, and leaving beautiful Wildtree and its happy family, let us fly to a sorry, tumbledown, desolate shed five miles away, on the hill-side.  It may have once belonged to a farm, or served as a shelter for sheep on the mountain-slopes.  But it now scarcely possesses a roof, and no sign of a habitation is anywhere visible.  The night has come on rainy and dark, and a weary tramp with his dog has been thankful to crawl into its poor shelter and rest his limbs.  The wind has risen and howls dismally round the shed, breaking every now and then through the loose planks, and stirring up the straw which carpets the place.  But the traveller is too weary to heed it or the rain which intrudes along with it, and crouching with his dog in the darkest corner, curls himself up in true tramp fashion, and settles down to sleep.  He has lain there two hours or more, and the mountain storm begins to abate.  The dog has been uneasy for some time, and now in the midst of a peal of thunder awakens his master with a gruff yap.  The sleeper sits up in an instant.  It is not the thunder that has disturbed the dog, nor is it thunder that the tramp now listens to close at hand.  It is the sound of voices, either inside the shed or just outside it.  Not a strange thing, perhaps, in a storm like this, for two wayfarers like himself to seek shelter--and yet the tramp seems startled by the sound, and signals to the dog to lie down and hold his peace.  \"Will it do?\" says one voice; and the tramp perceives that the speakers are standing outside the shed under the shelter of the projecting eaves.  \"No.  No good.  Too well looked after, and the people about the wrong sort.\"  \"There's a pile of swag there--heaps.\"  \"Know that.  Better wait till the family are away.\"  \"There's a child, isn't there?\"  \"A boy--fourteen--only child.\"  \"Might work it that way; eh?  Get a trifle for him eh?\"  \"A thousand, and no questions asked.  It's settled.\"  \"It is!  Why didn't you say so?  How are you going to do it?\"  \"Never you mind.  Corporal and I have worked it out.  It will be done to-night.  Moon's down at ten.  You be here at midnight, and have your hay-cart handy.  Corporal and I will bring him here.  We know where to find him in daylight, and can keep him quiet in the woods till dark.\"  \"What then?  Who's to keep him?\"  \"Wait till you've got him.\"  \"Are you sure they'll go a thousand for him?\"  \"Probably two.  Sheer off now, and don't forget, twelve o'clock.\"  The footsteps move away through the wet heather, and the tramp, waiting motionless till the last sound has faded away, draws a long breath and curls himself back into his roost.  But not to sleep--to meditate a campaign.  \"Julius,\" says he to the dog, who appears to be fully alive to the brewing storm, \"you and I will have to stop this business.  There'll be three to two, unless the boy fights too.  We must be here at eleven, and tackle one of them before the other two come.  What do you say to that?\"  Julius looks only sorry the business is not to begin at once.  Then the tramp and he go carefully into the plan of their little campaign, and, as soon as day dawns, go out for a walk, Julius taking care before quitting the shed to acquaint himself with the scent of the two gentlemen who had lately sheltered outside it.  The tramp spends a quiet day on the mountain, reading Homer, and admiring the view.  Towards nightfall he descends to Overstone and spends a few of his remaining pence in a frugal meal.  Then, as the moon dips behind the shoulder of Wild Pike, he betakes himself, with the faithful Julius close at his heels, to the shed on the mountain-side.    CHAPTER TWELVE.  KIDNAPPING.  Percy Rimbolt, despite his unusual literary labours of the past evening, rose promptly when Walker knocked at his door at six o'clock, and arrayed himself once more in his flannels.  The storm of the night, which had disturbed Jeffreys and his dog five miles away, had not spread as far as Wildtree, and the early summer sun was already hot as he sallied forth with his waterproof over one arm, and his dozen ash sticks under the other in the direction of the river. Kennedy, at the lodge, was considerably astonished to be awakened by a shower of gravel against his window, and to perceive, on looking out, the young master in full fishing order standing below, \"Kennedy, Appleby's going to leave some things here for me about twelve o'clock. Mind you're in, and wait till I come for them.  And if Raby comes, tell her I'll be up about then; tell her not to go away.\"  \"Do you want me down at the river, sir?\" asked the old keeper.  \"No, keep away; and don't let any one else come below Rodnet Bridge.\" With which injunction the youthful man of science went on his way, leaving Kennedy to shake his head and wonder what little game the young master was up to now.  Percy plodded on a couple of miles down the stream, considerably beyond the park boundaries, till he reached Rodnet Bridge, under which the mountain torrent slipped in a swift, deep stream.  Just below the bridge, among the trees which crowded down to the water's edge, was a little hut, used by the Wildtree keepers for depositing their baskets and nets, but now appropriated by the young heir of Wildtree for far more important purposes.  It was here, in fact, that during the last two days he had conceived, and begun to put into practice, the never-before-heard-of invention of a machine for enabling a swimmer to swim up-stream at the rate of eight to ten miles an hour!  Percy's recent career had been made up of a large number of magnificent projects, admirable in every respect but one--they never quite came off. Just as they neared perfection they \"gave out,\" and something new took their place.  It would be treason, however, to hint that the \"anti- current swimmer\" was ever likely to give out.  There certainly seemed no signs of it in the manner in which the inventor set about his task that morning.  He had been provident enough to bring some sandwiches in his pockets (provided at the last moment by the much-enduring Walker), and on the strength of these he laboured half the morning.  It would puzzle me to explain on what scientific principle the wonderful apparatus was laid down, what mixture between the wing of a bird, the tail of a fish, and the screw of a steamer it embodied.  I never was good at mechanics, and certainly Percy Rimbolt's mechanics were such as it is given but to few to follow.  Suffice it to say that by eleven o'clock the structure had reached a critical stage, and stood still for want of the cork which Appleby had been charged to procure.  The day was hot, and an hour at least must elapse before the messenger could return from Overstone.  Percy, therefore, improved the shining hour by a bathe in the clear stream, with whose depths he was evidently familiar.  He made no attempt, pending the completion of the machine, to oppose the swift current, but diving into it from the bridge, allowed himself luxuriously to be carried down into the shallows a hundred yards below, and without even the trouble of swimming.  This refreshing performance ended, he returned to the hut and dressed.  He was in the act of locking the door, preparatory to his journey up to Kennedy's lodge, when a sack was suddenly thrown over his head from behind, and next moment he found himself pinned to the ground in the clutches of two men.  Before he was well aware of what had happened, his feet were tied together, and his arms firmly lashed to his sides.  The sack was lifted from his mouth, but not long enough to enable him to shout, for a gag was roughly forced between his teeth; and then, while one of his captors held his head, the other bandaged his eyes so completely that, had he not known it, he could not have told whether it was mid-day or midnight. Thus, in almost less time than it takes to narrate it, in broad daylight, and on the borders of his own father's estate, the unfortunate Percy was made captive, without so much as being able to give an alarm or to see the faces of his assailants.  He was deposited comfortably on the floor of his own hut, by the side, oh, cruel fate! of his own machine, and there left to work out any number of problems which might occur to him during the next six hours; while his custodians, having carefully padlocked the door, retired to a respectful distance among the trees, where they could smoke their pipes in peace, and at the same time keep an eye on the approaches to their young ward's dungeon.  It did not take Percy many minutes to convince himself that any attempt to struggle or extricate himself from his bonds would be labour thrown away.  His captors were evidently well up to their business, and there was no wriggling out of their neatly-tied bonds.  Nor did the onslaught which the boy made with his teeth on the gag result in anything but disaster.  It loosened at least two of his teeth, and gave him during the remainder of the day considerable pain in some of the others.  As to his eyes, he rubbed his forehead and the side of his head on the floor, in the hopes of shifting the bandage, but all in vain.  He got it over his ears as well as his eyes for his pains, and could scarcely hear a sound.  As the afternoon went on, the sun slanted its rays cruelly through the little skylight on to the spot where he lay, and the flies, attracted by the rare chance, swarmed in under the door and through the cracks to make merry with their defenceless victim.  Had the sun been seven times as hot, or the flies venomous and deadly, he would have preferred it, for it would have shortened his misery considerably.  When at last the sun got across the window, and left him at peace, he was scarcely in a position to appreciate his mercies.  Not long after the distant Overstone chimes had sounded four, his heart (about the only unfettered portion of him) leapt to his mouth as he heard his name called in Raby's voice outside.  Nor was his the only heart whom that cheery sound caused to palpitate.  The two watchers in the wood above heard it, and prepared to decamp at a moment's notice, should the girl display any undue curiosity as to the contents of the hut.  But she did not.  She was used to seeing it padlocked, and to listen in vain for an answer to her call.  Percy was evidently abroad, probably waiting for her up at Kennedy's lodge.  So she hurried back.  As soon as she had disappeared beyond the bridge, the two men put their pipes into their pockets.  \"If they've begun looking for him we'd best sheer off, Corporal.\"  \"That's right,\" replied Corporal--\"at once.\"  Whereupon they descended from their perches, and having looked carefully up and down, unlocked the dungeon door.  Their prisoner was lying so still and motionless, that for an instant they had their misgivings as to whether the gag had not been a trifle too much for his respiration.  But a moment's examination satisfied them the boy was alive--much to their relief.  The sack was once more brought into requisition, and turned out to be a great deal larger than it looked, for it was found quite roomy enough to accommodate the whole of the person of Percy Rimbolt, who in this dignified retreat quitted the scene of his labours on the back of one of his captors.  The hut having been once more carefully padlocked, the party travelled at least a mile into the depths of the lonely woods, where at least there was no lack of shade and seclusion.  Percy was deposited somewhat unceremoniously on the ground, and left in the sack (with just sufficient aperture in the region of his nose to allow of respiration) for some hours more, unheeded by his custodians except when he attempted to move or roll over, on which occasions he was sharply reminded of his duty to his company by an unceremonious kick.  Some time later--it may have been an hour or two, or only five minutes-- he was aware of a conversation taking place outside his sack.  \"Risky,\" said one voice.  \"More risky not to do it,\" said the other.  \"What use would he be if he was a dead 'un?  Besides, how are we to carry him all that way?\"  \"All right, have it your way,\" said the other surlily.  Then Percy was conscious of some one uncording the mouth of the sack and uncovering his head.  \"Young feller,\" said the gruffer of the two voices, \"do you want your throat cut?\"  Percy shook his head in mild deprecation of such a desire.  \"Do you want your tongue cut out?\"  Once more Percy disclaimed any consuming anxiety in that direction.  \"Then you won't move a step or speak a word unless you're told.  Do you mark that?\"  The boy nodded; he did mark it.  Thereupon, much to his relief, the gag was taken from his mouth, and he felt himself hauled out of the ignominious sack.  \"A drink!\" he gasped.  \"There he goes; I said he'd do it.  Clap the gag on again.\"  Poor blindfolded Percy could only wave his head appealingly.  He would sooner have his throat cut than feel that gag back between his teeth. His captors let him off this once, and one of them untied the cords from his legs.  He was too cramped to attempt to make any use of this partial liberty, even had he been so minded, and sank down, half fainting, to the ground.  \"Give him a drink,\" said one of the voices; and in a moment or two he felt a cup of delicious water held to his parched lips, reviving him as if by magic.  A few coarse pieces of bread were also thrust between his lips; these he swallowed painfully, for his jaws were stiff and aching, and his teeth had almost forgotten their cunning.  However, when the meal was over he felt better, and would gladly have slept upon it for an hour or two, had he been allowed.  But this was no part of his captors' programme.  They had not relaxed his bonds to indulge any such luxurious craving.  Overstone Church had already sounded eleven, and they were due in an hour at the mountain shed.  \"Get up and step out,\" said one of them, pulling the boy roughly to his feet.  \"All very well,\" said Percy to himself, as he stumbled forward on his cramped limbs; \"they'll have to give me a leg up if they want me to go the pace.  Where are we going to next, I'd like to know?\"  \"Come, stir yourself,\" said the man again, accompanying his words by a rough shake.  Percy responded by toppling over on his face.  He who knew the way to swim against stream ten miles an hour, was just now unable to walk half a dozen paces on solid ground.  \"Best shove him in the sack again,\" growled the other man.  The bare mention of that sack startled poor Percy to his feet.  If he might only have spoken he could easily have explained the trifling difficulty which prevented his \"stepping out.\"  As it was, all he could do was to struggle forward bravely for a few more paces, and then again fall.  The men seemed to perceive that there was something more than mere playfulness in this twice-repeated performance, and solved the difficulty by clutching him one under each arm, and materially assisting his progress by dragging him.  Any of Percy's acquaintances would have been greatly shocked had they been privileged to witness this triumphal midnight progress across the moors; his dragging legs feebly trying to imitate the motions of walking, but looking much more like kneeling, his head dropped forward on his chest, his shoulders elevated by the grip of his conductors under his pinioned arms, and his eyes bandaged as never a blind-man's-buff could bind them.  It was a long weary march that; but to Percy it was luxury compared with the morning among the flies on the hut floor.  His conductors settled into a jog-trot, which the light weight of the boy did not much impede; and Percy, finding the motion not difficult, and on the whole soothing, dropped off into a half-doze, which greatly assisted in passing the time.  At length, however, he became aware of a halt and a hurried consultation between his captors.  \"Is he there?  Whistle?\"  Corporal gave a low whistle, which after a second or two was answered from the hill-side.  \"That's all right!\" said the other, in tones of relief.  \"See anything of the cart?\"  Corporal peered round in the darkness.  \"Yes--all right down there.\"  \"Come on, then.  Keep your eye on Jim, though, he's a mighty hand at going more than his share.\"  \"Trust me,\" growled Corporal.  Then Percy felt himself seized again and dragged forward.  In about five minutes they halted again, and the whistle was repeated.  The answer came from close at hand this time.  \"All square?\" whispered Corporal.  \"Yes!\" replied a new indistinct voice--\"come on.\"  \"Jim's screwed again,\" said the other man; \"I can tell it by his voice; there's no trusting him.  Come on.\"  They had moved forward half a dozen steps more, when Corporal suddenly found his head enveloped in a sack--a counterpart of his own--while at the same moment the other man was borne to the ground with a great dog's fangs buried in his neckcloth.  \"Hold him!\" called Jeffreys to the dog, as he himself applied his energies to the subjugation of the struggling Corporal.  It was no easy task.  But Jeffreys, lad as he was, was a young Samson, and had his man at a disadvantage.  For Corporal, entangled with the sack and unprepared for the sudden onslaught, staggered back and fell; and before he could struggle to his feet Jeffreys was on him, almost throttling him.  It was no time for polite fighting.  If Jeffreys did not throttle his man, his man, as he perfectly well knew, would do more than throttle him.  So he held on like grim death, till Corporal, half smothered by the sack and half-choked by his assailant's clutch, howled for quarter.  Then for the first time Jeffreys felt decidedly perplexed.  If he let Corporal go, Corporal, not being a man of honour, might turn on him and make mincemeat of him.  If, on the other hand, he called the dog off the other man to hold Corporal while he bound him captive, the other man might abuse his opportunity in a like manner.  The boy was evidently too exhausted to take any part in the encounter?  What could he do?  After turning the matter over, he decided that Julius was the most competent individual to settle the business.  The dog was having a very easy time with the abject villain over whom he was mounting guard, and could well undertake a little more than he had at present on his hands.  \"Fetch him here, Julius,\" called Jeffreys, giving Corporal an additional grip; \"come here, you fellow, along with the dog.\"  The fellow had nothing for it but to obey; and in a couple of minutes he was lying across the body of Corporal, while Julius stood fiercely over them both.  \"Come here, boy,\" called Jeffreys next to Percy; \"let me take off those cords.\"  Percy groped his way to him.  \"What are you going to do with me?\" he gasped.  \"Loose you; and if you're half a man you'll help me tie up these brutes. Come on--watch them there, Julius.  Why, you're blindfolded, too, and how frightfully tight you're corded!\"  \"I've been like that since twelve o'clock.\"  A few moments sufficed to unfasten the captive's arms and clear his eyes.  \"Now you,\" said Jeffreys, indicating the topmost of Julius's captives with his toe, \"put your hands behind your back!\"  The fellow obeyed hurriedly; he had had quite enough of Julius's attentions already to need more.  Jeffreys and Percy between them lashed first his wrists together, and then his elbows tightly to his sides.  Then they secured his feet and knees in the same manner.  \"He'll do--let him go, Julius,\" and prisoner Number 1 was rolled over, to make room for Number 2 to undergo a similar process of pinioning.  It was fortunate that the hay-cart below, of which and its owner Jeffreys and Julius had already taken possession at their leisure, had been liberally provided with cord, or their supply would have been inadequate to the strain put upon it.  At last, however, Corporal and his friend were as securely tied up as they themselves could have done it, and dragged into the shed.  It was pitch dark, and they neither of them at first perceived a third occupant of the tenement in the person of their fellow-conspirator, who was lying, bound like themselves, on the floor, where for an hour at least he had been enjoying the sweets of solitary meditation.  \"Now, Julius,\" said Jeffreys, when his three guests were duly deposited, \"you'll have to watch them here till I come back.  Hold your tongues, all of you, or Julius will trouble you.  Watch them, good dog, and stay here.\"  \"Now,\" said he to the boy, when they found themselves outside, \"what's your name?\"  \"Percy Rimbolt.\"  \"Where do you live?\"  \"Wildtree Towers, five miles away.\"  \"We can be there in an hour.  We may as well use this cart, which was meant to drive you in another direction.  Can you walk to it, or shall I carry you?\"  Percy, as one in a dream, walked the short distance leaning on his rescuer's arm.  Then, deposited on the soft hay, too weary to trouble himself how he got there, or who this new guardian might be, he dropped off into an exhausted sleep, from which he was only aroused by the sound of his parents' voices as the cart pulled up at the door of Wildtree Towers.    CHAPTER THIRTEEN.  POLICEMAN JULIUS.  Wildtree Towers had been thrown into a state of unmistakable panic when, at the usual hour of retiring for the night, Percy had not put in an appearance.  His absence at dinner-time agitated no one but his mother; and the search instituted at her bidding began languidly, and with the usual assurance of a speedy discovery.  But as hour passed hour and no tidings came, things began to look serious, and even Walker pulled a long face.  Midnight came, and still no tidings.  Appleby came up to the house for a lantern, but had nothing to report beyond the fact that the search so far had been unsuccessful.  The minutes dragged on for the unhappy watchers.  It was harder far for them to sit there in the hall, listening to the unsympathetic tick of the clock and starting at every sound on the gravel without, than it was for the father to tramp through the woods and trace the footsteps along the river's bank.  At last the clock struck two, and scarcely had the chimes ceased, when Walker put up his finger, and exclaimed,--  \"Hist!\"  A moment of terrible silence ensued.  Then on their quickened hearing there came a distant rumble of wheels.  Almost at the same instant footsteps came tearing up the gravel drive.  It was Appleby, who rushed into the midst of the group assembled on the doorstep.  \"All right--he's found!\" gasped the lad.  \"Is he alive?\" cried the mother.  \"On a cart!\" exclaimed the panting Appleby.  Mrs Rimbolt gave a little shriek, and fell into her husband's arms. Raby, nerved by the very agony of the suspense, rushed out and ran down the drive to meet the cart.  \"Is Percy there?\" she cried.  The cart stopped abruptly, and a strange voice replied,--  \"Yes--safe and well and fast asleep.\"  The words fell like music on the girl's ears.  It was too dark to see anything but the shadowy form of the cart and of a man walking at the horse's head.  She darted back to the house with the joyful news, and in another minute the cart stood at the door.  Percy, who was decidedly enjoying his sleep, felt by no means as grateful as he should have been to find himself disturbed at this early hour of the night.  \"All serene! all serene!\" he growled, in response to his mother's caresses and Walker's effusive shaking of the hand.  \"I'm all right, mother; I want to go to bed.\"  \"Get the hot bath ready,\" said Mrs Rimbolt to the servants.  \"My poor boy!\"  \"I tell you I'm all serene; can't you let me go to bed?\" said the half- awake Percy.  \"I don't want anything except sleep.\"  \"Walker, help Master Percy up to bed; let him take our room, and light a fire in it, and put hot bottles in the bed.\"  Percy, thankful to get back to his slumbers at any price, allowed Walker to help him up stairs.  At the door of his own room he stopped.  \"That will do; you can cut.  Walker.\"  \"But you're to have the best room and a fire--\"  \"You be hanged!\" exclaimed the boy, unceremoniously slamming the door in Walker's face, and locking himself in.  Downstairs, meanwhile, Jeffreys was being besieged with questions on all hands, which he endeavoured as best he could to answer.  Mr Rimbolt, however perceiving that very little good was to be got out of this confused cross-examination, asked him to follow him into the library, once more suggesting to his wife and niece that they should go to bed. Jeffreys was thankful to find himself in a serene atmosphere, and despite all the agitation and excitement of the day, his heart warmed as he looked round on the bookshelves and their friendly occupants.  \"Now,\" said Mr Rimbolt, who had made no attempt to take part in the babel outside, \"will you please tell me everything?\"  Jeffreys obeyed, and told his story in a concise and intelligent manner, which convinced Mr Rimbolt he had not only an honest man but a gentleman to deal with.  The master of Wildtree was not an effusive man, and if Jeffreys had looked to be overwhelmed with grateful speeches he would have been disappointed.  But he had not looked for it, and valued far more the quiet confidential manner in which Mr Rimbolt entered into all the details of the narrative.  \"Then,\" said the latter, when the story was ended, \"as a matter of fact you have the three ruffians penned in the shed by your dog at this moment--an excellent piece of management.\"  He rang his bell, and Walker, who had felt quite out of it for the half- hour, appeared with great promptitude.  \"Walker, are any of the men about still?\"  \"Appleby is holding this man's horse at the hall door, sir.\"  \"Send Appleby here, and take the horse and cart round to the farm.\"  Poor Walker!  This was a sad cut.  The farm was half a mile away, across the park; and this order meant that for another hour at least he must be an outsider in the drama.  \"Appleby,\" said Mr Rimbolt, when that jaunty youth appeared, \"take Benbow, and ride as quickly as you can, to the police-office at Overstone.  Tell the inspector with my compliments, to meet me with three constables at Rodnet Bridge at six o'clock, that is, in three hours.  Come back as quickly as you can, and have the dog-cart at the door at five.\"  \"Now,\" said he to Jeffreys, when these various matters of business had been put in train, \"we may as well occupy our time by getting something to eat, supper and breakfast in one--I dare say you are hungry.\"  As Jeffreys had scarcely eaten anything for three days--in fact, since his visit to Grangerham--he could honestly admit being ready for a meal.  \"I'm afraid we must forage for ourselves, unless some one is about,\" said Mr Rimbolt, leading the way to the pantry.  It was a curious spectacle that of the millionaire and the tramp together investigating the contents of the pantry shelves and lockers, lifting up dish-covers here, and critically testing the consistency of pie-crusts there.  They made a fairly good selection of the good things which came nearest to hand, and retiring with them to the adjacent kitchen, accomplished a meal more luxurious to Jeffreys' mind than any he had tasted since he left Bolsover.  This done, to his great satisfaction they adjourned once more to the library, where, while Mr Rimbolt took a brief nap, he regaled himself with the luxury of a prowl among the bookshelves, by the light of the dawning day.  So absorbed was he in this occupation that he did not hear the sound of the dog-cart at the front door, or heed Mr Rimbolt's first summons to start.  \"You're fond of books, surely,\" said that gentleman, as the two got up into the trap and drove off, with Appleby perched behind.  \"I love them,\" said Jeffreys, in the same tone of sincerity which had attracted the York bookseller.  \"You're a reader, then?\"  \"I would be if I had the chance,\" said Jeffreys.  \"You are thinking of my library,\" said Mr Rimbolt; \"but it doesn't follow, you know, that having a house full of books makes a reader.  A man may often get more good out of one tattered volume than out of an entire Russia-bound library.\"  \"I can quite believe that,\" said Jeffreys.  \"Probably you know what a favourite book is?\" said Mr Rimbolt rather curiously.  Jeffreys replied by producing his well-worn copy of Homer, and it would be hard to say which of these two foolish persons evinced the most enthusiasm in discovering that they both alike had a friend in the old Greek bard.  At any rate the discovery levelled at once the social differences which divided them; and in the discussion which ensued, I blush to say they forgot, for the time being, all about Percy, and the shed on the mountain-side, and the three gentlemen there to whom the genial Julius was doing the honours.  The appearance of the inspector and three constables at Rodnet Bridge brought the two unpractical excursionists on Mount Olympus abruptly back to level ground.  The business was soon explained.  The police, of course, knew all about the \"parties\"--when do they not?  They had been following them up for days, had had their suspicions of that mountain shed for weeks, and so on.  They couldn't exactly say they had known all about the attempt to kidnap last night; but they knew all about it now, for Appleby had let it out, and the \"active and intelligent\" in consequence had nothing to learn.  Half an hour brought them to the mountain-side.  Mr Rimbolt and Jeffreys dismounted, leaving Appleby in charge of the trap, while they, followed in single file by the police, ascended the narrow track towards the shed.  Half-way up, Jeffreys whistled; and a joyous bark from Julius assured the party that their game was safe.  \"You'd better let me go first,\" said Jeffreys to the inspector, who showed some anxiety to be foremost in the capture, \"unless you want my dog to fly at you.\"  The official fell back promptly, his native modesty getting the better of his zeal; and the party halted twenty yards from the shed while Jeffreys advanced to reconnoitre.  He saw at a glance that things were not exactly as he had left them.  Two out of the three prisoners remained securely bound, but the unlucky Corporal had slipped his feet from the cords, and paid dearly for his folly.  Julius had him down on the ground, daring him to move a limb or even turn his head on pain of unheard-of laceration.  The wretched fellow had cursed a thousand times his own artfulness.  For three hours he had lain thus, not daring to stir a muscle; and if ever a night's experiences are enough to turn the hair grey, Corporal should not have a single black lock left that morning.  \"Come off, Julius, and let them alone,\" said Jeffreys.  Julius obeyed somewhat reluctantly, though the pleasant task of welcoming his master's return reconciled him somewhat to the abandonment of his sovereignty.  Jeffreys beckoned to the party to advance.  \"These are the three men, sir,\" said he to Mr Rimbolt.  \"Yes, sir, these are the parties,\" said the inspector (who had never set eyes on the men before), advancing towards Corporal as he slowly raised himself from the ground.  Julius, greatly to the officers' alarm, made a last attempt to assert his property in the captives, and in Corporal in particular; and in so doing came very near doing a grievous injury to the arm of the law.  But Jeffreys' authoritative order to him to come in and he down allowed the arrest to proceed without any further protest than a few discontented yaps as the cords were removed from the prisoners' legs, and they were led off by the force.  \"We had better go to Overstone, too,\" said Mr Rimbolt, \"and see these ruffians safely quartered.  The assizes are coming on in a week or two. Do you live anywhere near here?\"  \"No,\" said Jeffreys.  \"Julius and I are on a walking tour at present.\"  Mr Rimbolt looked at his companion, and for the first time took notice of his travel-stained, shabby appearance.  \"You mean,\" said he, guessing the truth, \"you have no particular address at present?\"  \"Quite so,\" replied Jeffreys, flushing up uncomfortably.  Mr Rimbolt said nothing more just then.  They had a busy hour or two at Overstone arranging for the comfortable housing of their three prisoners, until the law should decide as to their more permanent residence.  Then, having taken farewell of the police, and returning towards the dog-cart, Jeffreys stopped abruptly and said, raising his hat,--  \"Good-bye, sir.\"  Mr Rimbolt looked at him in surprise.  \"You are not going, surely!\" said he.  \"You must come back to the house with me.\"  \"Thank you; Julius and I have a long journey before us, and must be starting.\"  \"You are only on a walking tour, you know.  There is a great deal to see round here.  The place is worth exploring,\" said Mr Rimbolt feeling almost as embarrassed as his companion.  \"We shall be back here for the assizes,\" said Jeffreys.  \"Nonsense, my friend!\" said Mr Rimbolt, taking the bull by the horns; \"I insist on your coming back with me now, if it's only to ask how Percy is after his night's excitement.  Besides, you have not half explored the library.\"  Whether it was the cordiality of this delicate invitation, or the mention of the library, or both combined, I cannot say; but Jeffreys, with some misgivings, yielded, and ascended the dog-cart.  \"The ladies would never forgive me,\" said Mr Rimbolt rather unwisely, \"if I let you go without giving them an opportunity of thanking you for your goodness to Percy.\"  Jeffreys was sorry he had yielded.  Had he only had Mr Rimbolt and the cool Percy to deal with, he could have resigned himself to the ordeal. But the threat of being thanked by the ladies quite disconcerted him.  \"I'm--I'm afraid I'm not very--tidy,\" stammered he.  \"I'd really rather, if you don't object, go on.  Besides, Julius--\"  Mr Rimbolt laughed good-humouredly.  \"Julius is not shy, and wants breakfast and a rest after his night's work, don't you, Julius?\"  Julius could not deny that he was very ready for both.  Jeffreys gave it up, and with much sinking of heart awaited their arrival at Wildtree Towers.  To his infinite relief, the ladies were not visible.  Mrs Rimbolt, it was reported, was confined to her bed by the effects of her recent agitation, and Miss Atherton was out.  Master Percy was still fast asleep.  It broke the fall considerably to find himself left still to the gentlemanly and unembarrassing attentions of his host.  Julius was led with honour to the kitchen, there to be regaled in a baronial fashion, which it was well for his morals and digestion was not a daily festival.  Jeffreys, having seen him comfortably curled up on a mat, returned to the library.  His host was pacing up and down the floor, evidently a little nervous, and Jeffreys instinctively felt that the ordeal was upon him.  Mr Rimbolt, however, began by a little fencing.  \"I recollect taking a very pleasant tour through this district with two college friends when I was at Oxford.  See, here is the map I had with me at the time, and the route marked.  We were rather a rackety party, and boasted that we would go in a straight line from Ambleside to the sea, and stick at nothing.  Here's the line, you see.  That straight line took us over one or two places I wouldn't care to try now.  But Oxford men, they said in those days, had no necks to break.  Are you a University man?\"  Jeffreys glanced up, half doubtful whether the question was asked in seriousness or ironically.  \"No, sir, unfortunately not.\"  \"Well,\" said Mr Rimbolt, \"it has its advantages and disadvantages.  You would, I dare say, value it; but for the serious work of life it may sometimes be unsettling.  Is it fair to ask what your profession is, Mr Jeffreys?\"  \"None at all just now.  I was till lately usher in a private school,\" replied Jeffreys, wincing.  Mr Rimbolt observed the wince, and delicately steered away from the topic.  \"Ah, that must be a monotonous calling, and you, with your love of books and literary tastes, would find it specially irksome.  You must forgive me if I take an interest in your affairs, Mr Jeffreys.  May I ask if you have any engagement in prospect?\"  \"None at all,\" said Jeffreys.  \"My reason for asking is a selfish one, quite, and has been suggested by the interest you take in my library.  I have been inquiring for a month or two for some one who will assist me as a private librarian.  The fact is, Mr Jeffreys,\" continued Mr Rimbolt, noticing the look of surprised pleasure in his listener's face, \"with my time so much occupied in parliamentary and other duties, I find it quite impossible to attend to the care of my books as I should wish.  I made up my mind most reluctantly some time ago that I should have to entrust the duty to some one else, for it was always my pride that I knew where every book I had was to be found.  But my collection has grown beyond my control and wants a regular custodian.  Look here,\" said he, opening a folding door at the end of the room.  Jeffreys saw another room, larger than the one he was in, lined with shelves, and crowded on the floor with heaps of books in most admired disorder.  \"It was no use,\" said Mr Rimbolt half pathetically.  \"I cherished the hope as long as I was able of reducing this chaos to order, and putting away each one of these treasures (for they are no common volumes) in a place of its own.  Every day it grows worse.  I've fought against it and put it off, because I could find no one who would undertake it as much for the love of the work as for the small salary to which a private librarian would be entitled.  Now you see the selfish reason I have for mentioning the matter to you, Mr Jeffreys.  I offer you nothing to jump at; for it will need sheer hard work and a lot of drudgery to overtake the arrears of work, and after that I doubt if the keeping up of the library will leave you much leisure.  You would incur no little responsibility either, for if I handed the care of the library to you, I should hold you responsible for every volume in it, and should expect you to know something of the inside of the books as well as the outside. You may think a salary of 100 a year hardly adequate to this amount of work and responsibility; if so I must not press you further, for that is the sum I have arranged to give, and cannot see my way to offering more. It would include residence here, and board, of course.\"  Jeffreys felt almost dazzled by the prospect thus deprecatingly unfolded by Mr Rimbolt.  Had the offer been made in any less delicate way; had it savoured of charity to the outcast, or reward to the benefactor, he would have rejected it, however tempting.  As it was, it seemed like the opening of one of the gates of Providence before him.  The work promised was what of all others he coveted; the salary, with the casually-thrown in addition of board and lodging, seemed like affluence; his employer was a gentleman, and the opportunities of study and self-improvement were such as fall to the lot of few.  Above all, in hard work among those quiet and friendly bookshelves he would find refuge from his bad name, and perhaps be able to establish for himself what he had hitherto striven for in vain--a character.  \"I am most grateful, sir,\" said he, \"if you really think I should suit you.\"  \"I think you would,\" said Mr Rimbolt, in a tone which gratified Jeffreys far more than if he had launched out into idle flattery and compliments.  And so it was settled.  Jeffreys could scarcely believe what had happened to him when, half an hour later, Mr Rimbolt being called away on business, he found himself taking a preliminary survey of his new preserves, and preparing himself seriously for his duties as private librarian at Wildtree Towers.    CHAPTER FOURTEEN.  SNOB AND SNUB.  Jeffreys was not long in finding out the best and the worst of his new lot at Wildtree Towers.  To an ordinary thick-skinned fellow, with his love of books and partiality for boys, his daily life during the six months which followed his introduction under Mr Rimbolt's roof might have seemed almost enviable.  The whole of each morning was devoted to the duties of the library, which, under his conscientious management, gradually assumed the order of a model collection.  A librarian is born, not made, and Jeffreys seemed unexpectedly and by accident to have dropped into the one niche in life for which he was best suited.  Mr Rimbolt was delighted to see his treasures gradually emerging from the chaos of an overcrowded lumber-room into the serene and dignified atmosphere of a library of well-arranged and well-tended volumes.  He allowed his librarian _carte blanche_ with regard to shelves and binding.  He agreed to knock a third room into the two which already constituted the library, and to line it with bookcases.  He even went the length of supporting a clever bookbinder at Overstone for several months with work on his own volumes, and, greatest sacrifice of all, forebore his craze of buying right and left for the same space of time until the arrears of work should be overtaken, and a clear idea could be formed of what he already had and what he wanted.  Jeffreys revelled in the work, and when he discovered that he had to deal with one of the most valuable private collections in the country, his pride and sense of responsibility advanced step by step.  He occupied his leisure hours in the study of bibliography; he read books on the old printers and their works; he spent hours with the bookbinder and printer at Overstone, studying the mechanism of a book; he even studied architecture, in connexion with the ventilation and lighting of libraries, and began to teach himself German, in order to be able to master the stores of book- lore buried in that rugged language.  All this, then, was congenial and delightful work.  He was left his own master in it, and had the pride of seeing the work growing under his hands: and when one day Mr Rimbolt arrived from London with a great man in the world of old books, for the express purpose of exhibiting to him his treasures, it called an honest flush to the librarian's face to hear the visitor say, \"Upon my word, Rimbolt, I don't know whether to congratulate you most on your books or the way in which they are kept! Your librarian is a genius!\"  If all his life could have been spent in the shelter of the library Jeffreys would have had little to complain of.  But it was not, and out of it it needed no great discernment to perceive that he had anything but a friend in Mrs Rimbolt.  She was not openly hostile; it was not worth her while to wage war on a poor domestic, but she seemed for all that to resent his presence in the house, and to be possessed of a sort of nervous desire to lose no opportunity of putting him down.  After about a week, during which time Jeffreys had not apparently taken her hint as to the arranging of his person in \"respectful\" raiment. Walker waited upon the librarian in his chamber with a brown-paper parcel.  \"My lady's compliments,\" said he, with a grin--he was getting to measure the newcomer by his mistress's standard--\"and hopes they'll suit.\"  It was a left-off suit of Mr Rimbolt's clothes, with the following polite note: \"As Mr Jeffreys does not appear disposed to accept Mrs Rimbolt's advice to provide himself with clothes suitable for the post he now occupies at Wildtree Towers, she must request him to accept the accompanying parcel, with the wish that she may not again have occasion to refer to so unpleasant a subject.\"  Jeffreys flushed scarlet as he read this elegant effusion, and, greatly to Walker's astonishment crushed the letter up into a ball and flung it out of the window.  \"Take that away!\" he shouted, pointing to the parcel.  \"The mistress sent it for--\"  \"Take it away, do you hear?\" shouted Jeffreys, starting up with a face so terrible that Walker turned pale, and evacuated the room with the offending parcel as quickly as possible.  Jeffreys' outburst of temper quickly evaporated, and indeed gave place to a much more prolonged fit of shame.  Was this like conquering the evil in his nature, to be thus thrown off his balance by a trifle?  As it happened, he had ordered a suit of clothes in Overstone some days back, and was expecting them that very afternoon.  Mr Rimbolt, on the day after his engagement, had as delicately as possible offered him a quarter's salary in advance, which Jeffreys, guessing the source which inspired the offer, had flatly refused.  Mr Rimbolt's gentlemanly urging, however, and the consciousness that his present clothes were disreputable, as well as another consideration, induced him to accept a month's stipend; and on the strength of this he had visited the Overstone tailor.  But before doing so he had discharged his mind of a still more important duty.  The sense of the debt still due to Bolsover had hung round his neck night and day.  It was not so much on Mr Frampton's account.  He came gradually to hate the thought of Bolsover, and the idea of being a defaulter to the place worried him beyond measure.  It seemed like an insult to the memory of poor young Forrester to owe money to the place which had witnessed that terrible tragedy; and the hope of washing his hands once for all of the school and its associations was the one faint gleam of comfort he had in looking back on the events of last year.  It was therefore with a feeling of almost fierce relief that he procured a post-office order for the balance of his debt on the very afternoon of receiving the money, and enclosing it with merely his name added--for he wanted no receipt, and felt that even Mr Frampton's letters would now no longer be of service to him--he posted it with his own hands, and hoped that he was done with Bolsover for ever.  After that, with very different emotions, he visited the tailor.  The clothes arrived on the same afternoon which had witnessed the summary rejection of Mrs Rimbolt's gift.  That lady, from whom Walker had considered it prudent to keep back some of the particulars of his interview with the librarian, merely reporting \"that Mr Jeffreys was much obliged, but did not require the things,\" took to herself all the credit of his improved appearance when that evening Mr Rimbolt brought him in from the library to have coffee in the drawing-room.  Jeffreys, aware that he was undergoing inspection, felt very shy and awkward, but could not quite do away with the improvement, or conceal that, despite his ugly face and ungainly figure there was something of the gentleman about him.  Mrs Rimbolt by no means approved of her husband bringing his librarian into the drawing-room.  She considered it a slight to herself and dangerous to Percy and Raby to have this person added to their family circle; and she most conscientiously made a point of lessening that danger on every occasion, by reminding him of his place and rendering his temporary visits to exalted latitudes as uncomfortable as possible. Mr Rimbolt, good easy-going gentleman, shrugged his shoulders and felt powerless to interfere, and when, after a week or two, his librarian generally pleaded some pressing work as an excuse for not going in to coffee, he understood it quite well and did not urge the invitation.  Percy, however, had a very different way of comporting himself.  What he liked he liked; what he did not like he most conveniently ignored.  He was anything but a model son, as the reader has discovered.  He loved his parents, indeed, but he sadly lacked that great ornament of youth--a dutiful spirit.  He was spoiled, and got his own way in everything.  He ruled Wildtree Towers, in fact.  If his mother desired him to do what he did not like, he was for the time being deaf, and did not hear her.  If he himself was overtaken in a fault, he changed the subject and talked cheerily about something else.  If one of his great \"dodges\" came to a ridiculous end, he promptly screened it from observation by a new one.  From the day of the kidnapping adventure he was a sworn ally of Jeffreys.  It mattered nothing to him who else snubbed the new librarian, or who else made his life uncomfortable.  Percy liked him and thought much of him.  He established a claim on his afternoons, in spite of Mrs Rimbolt's protests and Mr Rimbolt's arrangements.  Even Jeffreys' refusal to quit work at his bidding counted for nothing.  He represented to his mother that Jeffreys was necessary to his safety abroad, and to his father that Jeffreys would be knocked up if he did not take regular daily exercise.  He skilfully hinted that Jeffreys read Aeschylus with him sometimes; and once, as a crowning argument, produced a complete \"dodge,\" perfected and mechanically clever, \"which,\" he asserted, \"Jeff made me stick to till I'd done.\"  Mr Rimbolt did not conceal the satisfaction with which he noticed the good influence on the boy of his new friend, and readily fell in with the arrangement that Jeffreys' afternoons should be placed at his own (which meant Percy's) disposal.  As for Mrs Rimbolt, she groaned to think of her boy consorting with quondam tramps, yet consoled herself with the knowledge that Percy had now some one who would look after him and keep him out of danger, even with a vulgar right arm.  Jeffreys accepted this new responsibility cheerfully, and even eagerly. It sometimes came over him with a shock, what would these people say if they knew about young Forrester?  Yet was not this care of a boy given to him now as a means, if not of winning back his good name, at least of atoning in some measure by the good he would try to do him, and the patience with which he would bear with his exacting ways for what was past?  It was in that spirit he accepted the trust, and felt happy in it.  As the summer passed on, Wildtree, the moors around which were famous for their game, became full of visitors.  The invasion did not disturb Jeffreys, for he felt that he would be able to retire into private life and avoid it.  The company numbered a few boys of Percy's age, so that even that young gentleman would not be likely to require his services for a while.  He therefore threw himself wholly into his work, and with the exception of an hour each afternoon, when he took a turn on the hill-side, showed himself to no one.  On one of these occasions, as he was strolling through the park towards the moor, he encountered Miss Atherton, very much laden with a camp- stool, a basket, a parasol, and a waterproof.  Shy as he was, Jeffreys could hardly pass her without offering to relieve her of part of her burden.  \"May I carry some of those things?\" said he.  He had scarcely exchanged words with Raby since the day of his first arrival; and though he secretly numbered her among his friends, he had an uncomfortable suspicion that she looked down on him, and made an effort to be kind to him.  \"Thanks, very much,\" said she, really glad to get rid of some of her burdens; \"if you wouldn't mind taking the chair.  But I'm afraid you are going the other way.\"  \"No,\" said Jeffreys, taking the chair, \"I was going nowhere in particular.  May I not take the waterproof and basket too?\"  \"The basket is far too precious,\" said Raby, smiling; \"it has grapes in it.  But if you will take this horrid waterproof--\"  \"There is not much use for waterproofs this beautiful weather,\" said Jeffreys, beginning to walk beside her.  Then, suddenly recollecting himself, with a vision of Mrs Rimbolt before his mind, he fell back, and said awkwardly,--  \"Perhaps I had better--I must not detain you, Miss Atherton.\"  She saw through him at once, and laughed.  \"You propose to follow me with those things as if I was an Eastern princess!  Perhaps I had better carry them myself if you are afraid of me.\"  \"I'm not afraid of you,\" said Jeffreys.  \"But you are afraid of auntie.  So am I--I hope she'll meet us.  What were you saying about the weather, Mr Jeffreys?\"  Jeffreys glanced in alarm at his audacious companion.  He had nothing for it after this challenge but to walk with her and brave the consequences.  There was something in her half-mutinous, half-confiding manner which rather interested him, and made the risk he was now running rather exhilarating.  \"Percy seems to have forsaken you,\" said she, after a pause, \"since his friends came.  I suppose he is sure to be blowing his brains out or something of the sort on the moors.\"  \"Percy is a fine fellow, and certainly has some brains to blow,\" observed Jeffreys solemnly.  Raby laughed.  \"He's quite a reformed character since you came,\" said she; \"I'm jealous of you!\"  \"Why?\"  \"Oh, he cuts me, now he has you!  He used about once a week to offer to show me what he was doing.  Now he only offers once a month, and then always thinks better of it.\"  \"The thing is to get him to work at one thing at a time,\" said Jeffreys, to whom Percy was always an interesting study.  \"As soon as he has learned that art he will do great things.\"  \"I think Percy would make a fine soldier,\" said Raby, with an enthusiasm which quite captivated her companion, \"he's so brave and honest and determined.  Isn't he?\"  \"Yes, and clever too.\"  \"Of course; but my father always says a man needn't be clever to be a good soldier.  He says the clever soldiers are the least valuable.\"  \"Was your father a soldier?\"  \"Was?  He is.  He's in Afghanistan now.\"  \"In the middle of all the fighting?\"  \"Yes,\" said Raby, with a shade across her bright face.  \"It's terrible, isn't it?  I half dread every time I see a letter or a newspaper.  Mr Jeffreys!\" added the girl, stopping short in her walk, \"my father is the best and bravest man that ever lived.\"  \"I know he is,\" said Jeffreys, beginning to wonder whether some of the father's good qualities were not hereditary.  Raby looked up curiously and then laughed.  \"You judge of him by seeing how heroic I am braving my aunt's wrath!  Oh dear, I do hope she meets us.  It would be such a waste of courage if she doesn't.\"  \"I have benefited by your courage,\" said Jeffreys, quite staggered at his own gallantry.  \"I expect you're awfully dull in that old library,\" said the girl; \"you should hear how uncle praises you behind your back!  Poor auntie--\"  At that moment they turned a corner of the shrubbery leading up to the house, and found themselves suddenly face to face with Mrs Rimbolt with a gentleman and two or three of her lady guests.  Jeffreys flushed up as guiltily as if he had been detected in a highway robbery, and absolutely forgot to salute.  Even Raby, who was not at all sure that her aunt had not overheard their last words, was taken aback and looked confused. Mrs Rimbolt bridled up like a cat going into action.  She took in the situation at a glance, and drew her own inferences.  \"Raby, my dear,\" said she, \"come with us.  Colonel Brotherton wishes to see Rodnet Force, and we are going there.  Oh, Mr Jeffreys,\" added she, turning frigidly upon the already laden librarian, \"when you have carried Miss Atherton's things into the house, be good enough to go to Kennedy and tell him to meet us at the Upper Fall.  And you will find some letters on the hall table to be posted.  By-the-way, Colonel Brotherton, if you have that telegram you want to send off, the librarian will go with it.  It is a pity you should have the walk.\"  To these miscellaneous orders Jeffreys bowed solemnly, and did not fail to exhibit his clumsiness by dropping Raby's waterproof in a belated effort to raise his hat.  Mrs Rimbolt would hardly have been appeased had he not done so; and it was probably in a final endeavour to show him off as he departed that she added,--  \"Raby, give Mr Jeffreys that basket to take in; you cannot carry that up to the Falls.\"  \"Oh, aunt, I've told Mr Jeffreys I can't trust him with it.  It has grapes in it.  Didn't I, Mr Jeffreys?\" she said, appealing gaily to him with a smile which seemed to make a man of him once more.  \"I will undertake not to eat them,\" said he, with a twitch of his mouth, receiving the precious basket.  After that he sacrificed even his afternoon constitutionals, and took to the life of a hermit until Wildtree Towers should be rid of its visitors.  But even so he could not be quite safe.  Percy occasionally hunted him out and demanded his company with himself and a few choice spirits on some hare-brained expedition.  Jeffreys did not object to Percy or the hare-brained expedition; but the \"choice spirits\" sometimes discomposed him.  They called him \"Jeffy,\" and treated him like some favoured domestic animal.  They recognised him as a sort of custodian of Percy, and on that account showed off before him, and demonstrated to Percy that he was no custodian of theirs.  They freely discussed his ugliness and poverty within earshot.  They patronised him without stint, and made a display of their own affluence in his presence.  And when once or twice he put down his foot and interdicted some illegal proceeding, they blustered rudely, and advised Percy to get the cad dismissed.  It was like some of the old Bolsover days back again, only with the difference that now he steeled himself to endure all patiently for young Forrester's sake.  It disappointed him to see Percy, led away by his company, sometimes lift his heel against him; yet it suited his humour to think it was only right, and a part of his penance, it should be so. Percy's revolt, to do that youth justice, was short-lived and speedily repented of.  As soon as his friends were gone he returned to Jeffreys with all his old allegiance, and showed his remorse by forgetting all about his recent conduct.  Perhaps the most trying incident in all that trying time to Jeffreys was what occurred on the last day of the Brothertons' visit.  The colonel and his family had been so busy seeing the natural beauties of Wildtree, that, till their visit was drawing to an end, they found they had scarcely done justice to the beautiful house itself, and what it contained.  Consequently the last evening was spent in a visit _en masse_ to the library where Jeffreys was duly summoned to assist Mr Rimbolt in exhibiting the treasures it contained.  As usual when the lady of the house was of the party, the librarian went through his work awkwardly.  He answered her questions in a confused manner, and contrived to knock over one or two books in his endeavour to reach down others.  He was conscious that some of the company were including him among the curiosities of the place, and that Mr Rimbolt himself was disappointed with the result of the exhibition.  He struggled hard to pull himself together, and in a measure succeeded before the visit was over, thanks chiefly to Mrs Rimbolt's temporary absence from the library.  The lady returned to announce that coffee was ready in the drawing-room, and Jeffreys, with a sigh of relief, witnessed a general movement towards the door.  He was standing rather dismally near the table, counting the seconds till he should be left alone, when Mrs Brotherton advanced to him with outstretched hand.  Imagining she was about to wish him good-evening in a more friendly manner than he had expected, he advanced his own hand, when, to his horror and dismay, he felt a half-crown dropped into it, with the half-whispered remark, \"We are much obliged to you.\"  He was too staggered to do anything but drop his jaw and stare at the coin until the last of the party had filed from the room, not even observing the look of droll sympathy which Raby, the last to depart, darted at him.  Left to himself, one of his now rare fits of temper broke over him.  He stormed out of the place and up into his room, where, after flinging the coin into the grate, he paced up and down the floor like an infuriated animal.  Then by a sudden impulse he picked the coin up, and opening a toolbox which he kept in the room, he took from it a hammer and bradawl. Two or three vicious blows sufficed to make a hole in the centre of the Queen's countenance.  Then with a brass-headed nail he pinned the miscreant piece of silver to the wall above the mantelpiece, and sat looking at it till the storm was over.  It was a week or two before he quite recovered from this shock and settled down again to the ordinary routine of his life at Wildtree Towers.  As the afternoons became shorter, and out-of-door occupations in consequence became limited, he found Percy unexpectedly amenable to a quiet course of study, which greatly improved the tone of that versatile young gentleman's mind.  Percy still resolutely set his face against a return to school, and offered no encouragement to his perplexed parents in their various schemes for the advancement of his education. Consequently they were fain to be thankful, until some light dawned on the question, that his education was not being wholly neglected, and Mr Rimbolt in particular recognised that under Jeffreys' influence and tuition the boy was improving in more ways than one.  The autumn passed uneventfully.  Mr Rimbolt had occasion once or twice to go up to London, and on these occasions Jeffreys was reminded that he was not on a bed of roses at Wildtree.  But that half-crown over the mantelpiece helped him wonderfully.  Raby continued to regard him from a distance with a friendly eye, and now and then alarmed him by challenging him to some daring act of mutiny which was sure to end in confusion, but which, for all that, always seemed to him to have some compensation in the fellow-feeling it established between the poor librarian and the dependent and kept-under niece.  News arrived now and then from India, bringing relief as to what was past, but by no means allaying anxiety as to what might be in store for the soldier there.  A week before Christmas, Raby told Jeffreys, with mingled pride and trepidation, that her father had written to say he had been made major, and expected to be sent in charge of a small advance force towards Kandahar, to clear the way for a general advance.  By the same post another letter came for Mrs Rimbolt, the contents of which, as the Fates would have it, also came to Jeffreys' ears.  \"My dear,\" said the lady, entering the library that evening, letter in hand, and addressing her husband, who was just then engaged with his librarian in inspecting some new purchases, \"here is a letter from my old friend Louisa Scarfe.  She proposes to come to us for Christmas, and bring with her her son, who is now at Oxford.  I suppose I can write and say Yes?\"  \"Certainly,\" said Mr Rimbolt; \"I shall be delighted.\"  A chill went to Jeffreys' heart as he overheard this hurried consultation.  If this should be the Scarfe he knew, he was not yet rid, he felt, of Bolsover or of his bad name.    CHAPTER FIFTEEN.  FALLEN IN A HOLE.  Mrs Scarfe and her son arrived a day or two later at Wildtree Towers. Jeffreys, who from the recesses of a bay window was an unseen witness of the arrival, saw at a glance that his forebodings were too true.  Scarfe had changed somewhat since we saw him at Bolsover fifteen months ago. He was older and better-looking and wore a trim black moustache.  His dress was in the best Oxford style; and in his easy, confident carriage there remained no trace of the overgrown schoolboy.  His mother, a delicate-looking widow lady, returned Mrs Rimbolt's greeting with the eagerness of an old friend, and introduced her son with evident pride.  It was hopeless for Jeffreys to think of avoiding a recognition for long.  Still, he anxiously put off the evil hour as long as possible. The first afternoon and evening this was not difficult, for the travellers had made a long journey and retired early.  The following day he went through his work on tenterhooks.  Every time the library door opened he felt his heart sink within him, and every footstep he heard crossing the hall seemed to be the one he dreaded.  In the evening he attempted to escape the inevitable by taking refuge in his room after dinner.  But as it happened a messenger arrived from Overstone with a parcel of books, which made it necessary for him to return to the library.  And while there Mr Rimbolt as usual came in.  As soon as the business matter had been arranged Mr Rimbolt said, \"Miss Atherton has been asking to see Blake's _Songs of Innocence_, Jeffreys; will you kindly take the book to her in the drawing-room?  I have one of my tenants to see here, but I shall be in shortly.\"  There was no possible escape from this dilemma.  With a groan he got the book down from its place and went.  Scarfe, as he entered the drawing-room, was engaged in turning over a book of prints with Raby, and did not notice him.  Nor did Mrs Rimbolt, siting on the sofa beside her friend, heed his entrance till Percy said,--  \"Hullo, Jeff!\"  Jeffreys became aware that the eyes of the whole party were suddenly centred on him--Mrs Rimbolt's from under lifted eyebrows, Mrs Scarfe's through raised eye-glasses, Raby's with a veiled welcome, Scarfe's in blank astonishment.  He advanced awkwardly into the room.  \"Close the door, please, Mr Jeffreys,\" said Mrs Rimbolt, in tones which left no manner of doubt in her visitors' minds as to the status of the librarian in the house.  Jeffreys obeyed, and advanced once more towards Raby.  \"Your uncle,\" stammered he, conscious of nothing but Scarfe's stare, \"asked me to bring you this book.\"  Then, turning with a desperate effort to his old schoolfellow, he said, \"How are you, Scarfe?\"  He scorned himself for the half-appealing tone in which the salutation was made.  What was Scarfe to him?  Nothing, save that Scarfe and he had both looked down that October afternoon on the motionless form of one small boy in the Bolsover meadow.  And was that nothing?  \"How do you do, Jeffreys?\" said Scarfe, stiffly extending his hand, and immediately afterwards returning to his examination of the prints with Raby.  \"Do you know Jeff?\" asked Percy, who had witnessed the recognition.  \"Yes.  Jeffreys and I have met,\" said Scarfe, not looking up from his book.  \"Who is that young man?\" said Mrs Scarfe, in an audible whisper to her hostess.  \"The librarian here.  Mr Jeffreys,\" added Mrs Rimbolt, as Jeffreys stood irresolute, not knowing whether to remain in the room or go, \"be good enough to tell Walker he can bring the coffee, and tell Mr Rimbolt we are expecting him.\"  \"Mr Rimbolt asked me to say you are not to wait coffee for him.  He may be detained with a tenant in the library.\"  \"Jeff, I say, you should have been with us this afternoon.  We had such larks.  We got one or two pot shots, but didn't hit anything except the dog.  So it's a good job we didn't borrow Julius.  Kennedy says we're in for a ripping frost, so save yourself up, old man.\"  \"Percy, you talk like a stable-boy.  Do remember you are in the drawing- room; and don't detain Mr Jeffreys from his work.\"  Under cover of this maternal exhortation Jeffreys withdrew.  \"Rum your knowing Jeff, Scarfe!\" said Percy, after he had gone; \"was he at Oxford?\"  \"No,\" said Scarfe.  \"It was at school.  Surely that must be one of Hogarth's engravings, Miss Atherton, it is exactly his style.\"  \"It wasn't much of a school, was it?\" persisted Percy.  \"Jeff told me he didn't care about it.\"  \"I don't think he did,\" replied Scarfe with a faint smile.  \"I suppose you are very fond of Oxford, are you not?\" said Mrs Rimbolt; \"every one who belongs to the University seems very proud of it.\"  This effectually turned the conversation away from Jeffreys, and the subject was not recurred to that evening, except just when Scarfe was bidding his mother good-night in her boudoir.  \"I hope you won't be dull here,\" said she.  \"Miss Atherton seems a pleasant girl, but it is a pity Percy is not older and more of a companion.\"  \"Oh, I shall enjoy myself,\" said Scarfe.  \"You don't seem very fond of that Mr Jeffreys.\"  \"No, I draw the line somewhere, mother,\" said the son.  \"What do you mean?  Is there anything discreditable about him?  He looks common and stupid, to be sure.  Mrs Rimbolt tells me Percy is greatly taken up with him.\"  \"They appear to have curious ideas about the kind of companion they choose for their boy,\" said Scarfe.  \"But it's no business of ours. Good-night, mother.\"  And he went, leaving Mrs Scarfe decidedly mystified.  Jeffreys and Scarfe occasionally met during the next few days.  Jeffreys was rather relieved to find that his late schoolfellow seemed by no means anxious to recall an old acquaintance or to refer to Bolsover.  He could even forgive him for falling into the usual mode of treating the librarian as an inferior.  It mattered little enough to him, seeing what Scarfe already knew about him, what he thought of him at Wildtree.  On the whole, the less they met and the less they talked together, the less chance was there of rousing bitter memories.  The Scarfes would hardly remain more than a month.  If for that time he could efface himself, the danger might blow over, and he might be left at the end of the time with the secret of his bad name still safe at Wildtree Towers.  Kennedy's prophecy of a hard frost turned out to have been a knowing one.  All through Christmas week it continued with a severity rare even in that mountainous region; and when on New Year's Day the report reached Wildtree that a man had skated across the upper end of Wellmere it was admitted to be a frost which, to the younger generation of the place at least, \"beat record.\"  Percy was particularly enthusiastic, and terrified his mother by announcing that he meant to skate across Wellmere, too.  Raby, though less ambitious, was equally keen for the ice; and Scarfe, indolently inclined as he was, was constrained to declare himself also anxious to put on his skates.  A day was lost owing to the fact that Percy's skates, which had lain idle for two years, were now too small for him and useless.  Mrs Rimbolt devoutly hoped the ironmonger in Overstone would have none to fit him, and used the interval in intriguing right and left to stop the projected expedition.  She represented to her husband that the head gardener was of opinion that the frost had reached its height two days ago.  She discovered that Scarfe had a cold, to which exposure might be disastrous.  Raby she peremptorily forbade to dream of the ice; and as for Percy, she conjured him by the love he bore her to skate on nothing deeper than the Rodnet Marsh, whereat that young gentleman gibed.  The Overstone ironmonger had skates which fitted the boy to a nicety, and by way of business sent up \"on inspection\" a pair which Mr Rimbolt might find useful for himself.  \"You surely will not allow Percy to go?\" said the lady to her husband, on the morning after the arrival of the skates.  \"Why not?  He's a good skater, and we don't often have a frost.\"  \"But on Wellmere!  Think of the danger!\"  \"I often skated across Wellmere when I was a boy.  I would not object to do it again if I had the time to spare.  I declare the sight of the skates tempted me.\"  \"I don't believe Mr Scarfe can swim.  What would happen if there were an accident?\"  \"I think you overrate the danger,\" said her husband; \"however, if it pleases you, I will get Jeffreys to go with them.  He can swim, and I dare say he can skate, too.\"  Mrs Rimbolt shied a little at the suggestion, but yielded to it as a compromise, being better than nothing.  Jeffreys would fain have evaded this unexpected service.  \"I have no skates,\" he said, when Mr Rimbolt proposed it.  \"Yes; the ironmonger sent up a pair for me, and as I can't use them you are welcome to them.\"  \"Did you not want the books from Sotheby's collated before to-morrow?\"  \"No, Saturday will do.  Honestly, Jeffreys, I would be more comfortable, so would Mrs Rimbolt, if you went.  We have experience of the care you take of Percy.  So, you see, I ask a favour.\"  It was useless to hold out.  \"I will go,\" said he; and it was settled.  An hour later Scarfe, Percy, Jeffreys, and Julius stood at the hall door ready to start.  \"Where's Raby, I say?\" cried Percy; \"she said she'd come.\"  \"I do not wish Raby to go.\"  \"Oh, look here, mother, as if we couldn't look after her; eh, Scarfe?\"  \"It will be no pleasure without Miss Atherton,\" said Scarfe.  \"Can't she come, father?\" said Percy, adroitly appealing to Caesar.  \"I really think it would be a pity she should miss the fun.\"  \"Huzzah!  Raby, where are you?  Look sharp! father says you can come, and we're waiting!\" cried Percy.  Raby, who had been watching the party rather wistfully, did not keep them long waiting.  Wellmere was a large lake some five miles long and a mile across.  In times of frost it not unfrequently became partially frozen, but owing to the current of the river which passed through it, it seldom froze so completely as to allow of being traversed on skates.  This, however, was an extraordinary frost, and the feat of the adventurer on New Year's Day had been several times repeated already.  The Wildtree party found the ice in excellent order, and the exhilarating sensation of skimming over the glassy surface banished for the time all the unpleasant impressions of the walk.  It was several years since Jeffreys had worn skates, but he found that five minutes was sufficient to render him at home on the ice.  He eschewed figures, and devoted himself entirely to straightforward skating, which, as it happened, was all that Percy could accomplish--all, indeed, that he aspired too.  It therefore happened naturally that Scarfe and Raby, who cultivated the eccentricities of skating, were left to their own devices, while Jeffreys, accompanied of course by Julius, kept pace with his young hero for the distant shore.  It was a magnificent stretch.  The wind was dead, the ice was perfect, and their skates were true and sharp.  \"Isn't this grand?\" cried Percy, all aglow, as they scudded along, far outstripping the perplexed Julius.  \"Better than smoking cigarettes, eh, old Jeff?\"  Jeffreys accepted this characteristic tender of reconciliation with a thankful smile.  \"I was never on such ice!\" said he.  \"Looks as if it couldn't thaw, doesn't it?\" said Percy.  \"It's better here in the middle than nearer the shore.  I hope those two won't get too near the river, it looks more shaky there.\"  \"Trust Scarfe!  He knows what's what!  I say, aren't he and Raby spoons?\"  \"Mind that log of wood.  It must be pretty shallow here,\" said Jeffreys, his face glowing with something more than the exercise.  They made a most successful crossing.  Returning, a slight breeze behind them favoured their progress, and poor Julius had a sterner chase than ever.  As they neared their starting-point Jeffreys looked about rather anxiously for Scarfe and Raby, who, tiring of their fancy skating, had started on a little excursion of their own out into the lake.  \"I wish they wouldn't go that way,\" said he, as he watched them skimming along hand-in-hand; \"it may be all right, but the current is sure to make the ice weaker than out here.\"  \"Oh, they're all serene,\" said Percy.  \"I'll yell to them when we get near enough.\"  Presently, as they themselves neared the shore, they noticed Scarfe turn and make for the land, evidently for something that had been forgotten, or else to make good some defect in his skates.  Raby, while waiting, amused herself with cutting some graceful figures and curvetting to and fro, but always, as Jeffreys noted with concern, edging nearer to the river.  Percy shouted and waved to her to come the other way.  She answered the call gaily and started towards them.  Almost as she started there was a crack, like the report of a gun, followed by a cry from the girl.  Jeffreys, with an exclamation of horror and a call to Julius, dashed in an instant towards her.  The light girlish figure, however, glided safely over the place of danger.  Jeffreys had just time to swerve and let her pass, and next moment he was struggling heavily twenty yards beyond in ten feet of icy water.  It all happened in a moment.  Percy's shout, the crack, the girl's cry, and Julius's wild howl, all seemed part of the same noise.  Percy, the first of the spectators to recover his self-possession, shouted to Scarfe, and started for the whole.  \"I'm all right, don't come nearer,\" called Jeffreys, as he approached; \"there's a ladder there, where Scarfe is.  Bring it.\"  Percy darted off at a tangent, leaving Jeffreys, cool in body and mind, to await his return.  To an ordinarily excitable person, the position was a critical one.  The water was numbing; the ice at the edge of the hole was rotten, and broke away with every effort he made to climb on to it; even Julius, floundering beside him, bewildered, and at times a dead weight on his arms and neck, was embarrassing.  Jeffreys, however, did not exhaust himself by wild struggles.  He laid his stick across the corner of the hole where the ice seemed firmest, and with his arms upon it propped himself with tolerable security.  He ordered the dog out of the water and made him lie still at a little distance on the ice.  He even contrived to kick off one boot, skate and all, into the water, but was too numbed to rid himself of the other.  It seemed an eternity while Scarfe and Percy approached with the ladder, with Raby, terrified and pale, hovering behind.  \"Don't come nearer,\" he shouted, when at last they got within reach. \"Slide it along.\"  They pushed it, and it slipped to within a yard of him.  Julius, who appeared to have mastered the situation, jumped forward, and fixing his teeth in the top rung, dragged it the remaining distance.  The remainder was easy.  Scarfe crawled along the ladder cautiously till within reach of the almost exhausted Jeffreys, and caught him under the shoulder, dragging him partially up.  \"I can hold now,\" said Jeffreys, \"if you and Percy will drag the ladder. Julius, hold me, and drag too.\"  This combined effort succeeded.  A minute later, Jeffreys, numbed with cold but otherwise unhurt, was being escorted on his one skate between Percy and Scarfe for the shore, where Raby awaited him with a look that revived him as nothing else could.    CHAPTER SIXTEEN.  A BRUSH NEAR KANDAHAR.  While Raby that night dreamed troublously of the events of the day, a soldier was sitting in his tent near Kandahar, some four thousand or more miles away, reading a letter.  He was an officer; his sword lay beside him on the table, his boots were off, and a flannel coat took the place of the regimental jacket which lay beside his saddle on the floor. If these signs were not sufficient to prove that for the time being he was off duty, his attitude as he lolled back in his camp-chair, with his feet on the table considerably above the level of his chin, reading his letter by the uncertain light of a lamp, would have left little doubt on the subject.  So engrossed indeed was he that he was unaware of the presence of his native servant in the tent preparing supper, and read aloud to himself.  The envelope of the letter, which lay on the table, was a foreign one with an English stamp, and addressed in a feminine hand.  The soldier, having completed his first perusal, turned back to the beginning, reading partly to himself, partly aloud.  \"`October 4'--three months ago or more!--before she heard of this business.  `You poor dull darling'--nice names to call one's father, true enough, though, at the time, it was brutally dull at Simla--`I can fancy how you hate loafing about all day with nothing to do but try and keep cool and find a place to sleep in where the flies can't worry you.' Hum!  Picture of a soldier's life!  A little different from the usual impression, but not very wide of the mark after all.\"  Then he read to himself for a bit something which made his weather- beaten face soften, and brought a sparkle to his eyes.  \"Bless the child!\" he murmured; \"she doesn't forget her old father! `How glad I shall be if you get sent to the front, for I know how you hate doing nothing.  If you are, I shall be foolish, of course, and imagine all sorts of horrors whenever I see a letter.'  That's the way girls back their fathers up!  `Oh, why couldn't I be a soldier too, and ride behind you into action, instead of dawdling here doing no good to anybody, and living like a fine young lady instead of a simple soldier's daughter?'  Whew! what a fine little colour-sergeant she'd make! Wouldn't Mrs Grundy sit up if she read that?  \"Hum!\" he went on, after reading a little further.  \"`I oughtn't to grumble.  Uncle Rimbolt is the kindest of protectors, and lets me have far too many nice things.  Aunt has a far better idea of what a captain's daughter should be.  She doesn't spoil me.  She's like a sort of animated extinguisher, and whenever I flicker up a bit she's down on me.  I enjoy it, and I think she is far better pleased that I give her something to do than if I was awfully meek.  It all helps to pass the time till my dear old captain comes home.'  Heigho! that means she's miserable, and I'm not to guess it!  I had my doubts of Charlotte Rimbolt when I let her go to Wildtree.  Poor little Raby! she's no match for an animated extinguisher!  \"`Percy,' continued the letter, `is as lively and full of \"dodges\" as ever.  He soon got over his kidnapping adventure.  Indeed, the only difference it has made is that we have now one, or rather two, new inmates at Wildtree, for Uncle Rimbolt has employed Percy's rescuer as his librarian, and the dog has, of course, taken up his abode here too. He is a perfect darling! so handsome and clever!  He took to me the first moment I saw him, and he would do anything for me.'  Really!\" said the father; \"that's coming it rather strong, isn't it, with the new librar-- Oh, perhaps she means the dog!  Ha, ha!  `Aunt Rimbolt gets some fine extinguisher practice with this newcomer, against whom she has a most unaccountable prejudice.  He is very shy and gentlemanly, but I am sure Percy never had a better friend.  He has become ever so much steadier.'  Did you ever know such letter-writers as these girls are? Which newcomer does she mean, the fellow who's a perfect darling, or the fellow who's shy and gentlemanly? and which, in the name of wonder, is the man and which the dog?  Upon my word, something awful might be going on, and I should be none the wiser!  `Julius nearly always escorts me in my walks.  He is _such_ a dear friendly fellow, and always carries my bag or parasol.  Aunt, of course, doesn't approve of our being so devoted to one another, for she looks upon Julius as an interloper; but it doesn't matter much to us.  Percy often comes with us, but Julius rather resents a third person.  He thinks--so do I, much as I like Percy--that two are company and three are none.'\"  Major Atherton--for the soldier was no other--leaned back in his chair, and fanned himself with the letter.  \"How _on earth_ am I to know who or what she is talking about?  If it's not the dog, upon my honour, Aunt Rimbolt-- It can't be the dog, though. She calls him Julius; and why should she take the boy along with them if it wasn't the librarian puppy she walked with?  Rimbolt ought to look after things better than that!  \"`Uncle Rimbolt thinks very highly of his new _protege_.  He is so quiet; it is quite painful sometimes talking to him.  I'm sure he has had a lot of trouble; he has a sort of hunted look sometimes which is quite pathetic.  Aunt hardly ever lets him come into the drawing-room, and when she does it is generally in order to snub him.  I fancy he feels his anomalous position in this house very much.'\"  \"My patience!  That's a mild way of putting it!\" exclaimed the major; \"the anomalous position of this hunted-looking, shy librarian who carries her parasol and escorts her about, and suggests to Percy that two are company and three are none!  All I can say is the sooner we get into Kandahar and are paid off home the better!\"  \"What's that you're saying about Kandahar, old man?\" said a voice at the door of the tent, and there entered a handsome jaunty-looking officer of about Atherton's age.  \"That you, Forrester?  Come in.  I've just had a letter from my little girl.\"  A shade crossed Captain Forrester's cheery face.  \"Your luck, my dear boy.  I haven't had a line.\"  \"Perhaps there's a letter for you at head-quarters.\"  \"I doubt it.  But don't talk about it.  How's your girl flourishing?\"  \"Upon my honour, she seems to be a little too flourishing,\" said the major, taking up his letter with a look of puzzled concern.  \"You may be a better English scholar than I am, Forrester, and be able to make head or tail of this.  As far as I can make it out, Raby is flourishing very decidedly.  Here, read this second sheet.\"  Captain Forrester took the letter, and read the part indicated carefully.  The major watched him anxiously till he had done.  \"Well?\" he asked, as his comrade handed it back.  \"It seems to be a case,\" said the latter.  \"That's what I thought.  I don't like that carrying her parasol, and telling the boy that two are company--\"  Captain Forrester burst into a loud laugh.  \"Why, you glorious old donkey, that's the dog!\"  \"Nonsense; she'd never say a dog was shy and gentlemanly, and looked as if he'd had a lot of trouble.\"  \"No,\" said the captain holding his sides, \"that's the librarian.\"  \"Who--the fellow Julius she talks about?\" asked the major, beginning to feel very warm.  \"The fellow Julius!  Why, Julius is the dog!\"  The major rose from his seat in agitation, and stood before his friend.  \"Forrester,\" said he solemnly, \"as soon as I see the joke I'll laugh. Meanwhile tell me this.  Who in the name of mystery is it who feels his anomalous position at Wildtree, the man or the dog?\"  Captain Forrester held gallantly on to his chair to prevent falling off; and the native without, hearing his shouts, looked in at the door to see what the sahib wanted.  \"My dear fellow,\" said he at last, \"I begin to think I know more than you.  Can't you see this daughter of yours is decidedly interested in this young _protege_ of her uncle?\"  \"Most decidedly I see that.\"  \"And that in order to throw dust in your fatherly old eyes, she makes a great gush about the dog Julius, and says hardly a word about the master, whose name does not appear.\"  Major Atherton took up the letter again and glanced through it, and a light began to break on his puzzled countenance.  \"Then,\" said he, \"the fellow who's handsome and clever and a perfect darling is--\"  \"Is the bow-wow.  And the fellow who's hunted-looking and not allowed in the drawing-room is his master.\"  Major Atherton resumed his chair, and once more planted his feet on the table.  \"That is a way of putting it, certainly.  If so, it's a relief.\"  \"My dear boy, keep your eye on that librarian, or he may change places with his dog in double-quick time.\"  The major laughed, and a pause ensued.  Then Forrester said--  \"Two or three days more, and we ought to be in Kandahar.\"  \"We are to have a stiff brush or two before we get there,\" said the major; \"any hour now may bring us to close quarters.\"  There was another pause.  Captain Forrester fidgeted about uneasily, and presently said--  \"It's possible, old man, only one of us may get through.  If I am the one who is left behind, will you promise me something?\"  \"You know I will.\"  \"That boy of mine, Atherton, is somewhere, I'm as sure of it as that I'm sitting here.  He's vanished.  My letters to Grangerham cannot all have miscarried, and they certainly have none of them been answered.  My mother-in-law, as I told you, died in the south of England.  The boy may have been with her, or left behind in Grangerham, or he may be anywhere. I told you of the letter I had from the school?\"  \"Yes; he had had an accident and gone home damaged--crippled, in fact.\"  \"Yes,\" said Captain Forrester, with a groan, \"crippled--and perhaps left without a friend.\"  \"You want me to promise to find him if you are not there to do it, and be a father to him.  You needn't ask it, old man, for I promise.\"  \"I've nothing to leave him,\" said Captain Forrester, \"except my sword and this watch--\"  \"And the good name of a gallant soldier.  I will, if it is left to me to do it, take the boy all three.\"  \"Thanks, Atherton.  You know that I would do the same by you, old fellow.\"  \"You may have the chance.  That girl of mine, you know,\" added the major, with a tremble in his voice, \"would have what little I have saved, which is not much.  She's a good girl, but she would need a protector if I was not there.\"  \"She shall have it,\" said his friend.  \"I'm not sure that she's happy at Wildtree,\" continued the father, with a smile, \"despite the dog and his master.  Rimbolt's a bookworm, and doesn't see what goes on under his nose, and her aunt, as she says, is an animated extinguisher.  It always puzzled me how Rimbolt came to marry Charlotte Halgrove.\"  \"Halgrove?  Was she the sister of your old college friend?\"  \"Yes.  Rimbolt, Halgrove, and I were inseparable when we were at Oxford. Did I ever tell you of our walking tour in the Lakes?  We ruled a bee- line across the map with a ruler and walked along it, neck or nothing. Of course you know about it.  We've sobered down since then.  Rimbolt married Halgrove's sister, and I married Rimbolt's.  I had no sister, so Halgrove remained a bachelor.\"  \"What became of him?\"  \"I fancy he made a mess of it, poor fellow.  He went in for finance, and it was too much for him.  Not that he lost his money; but he became a little too smart.  He dropped a hundred or two of mine, and a good deal more of Rimbolt's--but he could spare it.  The last I heard of him was about twelve years ago.  He had a partner called Jeffreys; a stupid honest sort of fellow who believed in him.  I had a newspaper sent me with an account of an inquest on poor Jeffreys, who had gone out of his mind after some heavy losses.  There was no special reason to connect Halgrove with the losses, except that Jeffreys would never have dreamed of speculating if he hadn't been led on.  And it's only fair to Halgrove to say that after the event he offered to take charge of Jeffreys' boy, at that time eight years old.  That shows there was some good in him.\"  \"Unless,\" suggested Captain Forrester, \"there was some money along with the boy.\"  \"Well, I dare say if he's alive still, Rimbolt will know something of him; so I may come across him yet,\" said the major; and there the conversation ended.  Major Atherton's prophecy of a brush with the enemy was not long in being fulfilled.  Early next day the expeditionary force was ordered forward, the cavalry regiment in which the two friends were officers being sent ahead to reconnoitre and clear the passes.  The march lay for some distance along a rocky valley, almost desolate of habitations, and at parts so cumbered with rocks and stones as to be scarcely passable by the horses, still less by the artillery, which struggled forward in front of the main body.  The rocks on the right bank towered to a vast height, breaking here and there into a gorge which admitted some mountain stream down into the river below, and less frequently falling back to make way for a wild saddle-back pass into the plains above.  Along such a course every step was perilous, for the enemy had already been reported as hovering at the back of these ugly rocks, and might show their teeth at any moment.  For an hour or two, however, the march continued uninterrupted.  The few scattered Afghans who had appeared for a moment on the heights above had fallen back after exchanging shots, with no attempt at serious resistance.  The main body had been halted in the valley, awaiting the return of the scouts.  The horses had been unharnessed from the guns, and the officers were snatching a hurried meal, when Captain Forrester at the head of a few troopers scampered into the lines.  The news instantly spread that the enemy had been seen ahead, and was even then being chased by the cavalry up one of the defiles to the right.  Instantly, and without even waiting for the word of command, every man was in his place ready to go on.  The guns, with Captain Forrester's troop as escort, dashed forward to hold the defile; while the main body, divided into two divisions--one to follow the guns, the other to reach the plain above by a nearer pass--started forward into action.  The cavalry, meanwhile, with Major Atherton at their head, were already engaged in a hot scrimmage.  Following their usual tactics, the Afghans, after exchanging shots at the entrance of the pass, had turned tail and dashed through the defile, with the English at their heels.  Then, suddenly turning as they reached the plain beyond, they faced round on their pursuers, not yet clear of the rocky gorge.  In the present instance, however, when within about a hundred yards of the head of the column, they wheeled round again, and once more bolted into the open.  A stern chase ensued over the rough broken ground, the enemy now and then making a show of halting, but as often giving way and tempting the cavalry farther out into the plain.  The Afghans numbered only about two hundred horsemen, but it was quite evident from their tactics that they had a much larger body in reserve, and Major Atherton was decidedly perplexed as to what he should do.  For if he pursued them too far, he might be cut off from his own men; if, on the other hand, he made a dash and rode them down before they could get clear, he might cut them off from their main body, and so clip the enemy's wings.  The enemy settled the question for him.  Just as he was looking round for the first sign of Forrester and the guns in the pass, the plain suddenly swarmed with Afghans.  From every quarter they bore down on him, horse and foot, and even guns, seeming almost to spring, like the teeth of Cadmus, from the earth.  It was no time for hesitation or doubt.  Retreat was out of the question.  Equally hopeless was it to warn the troops who were coming up.  There was nothing for it but to stand at bay till the main body came up, and then, if they were left to do it, fight their way out and join forces.  The major therefore brought his men to a corner of the rocks, where on two sides, at any rate, attack would be difficult; and there, ordering them to dismount and form square, stood grimly.  A cruel half-hour followed.  Man after man of that little band went down before the dropping fire of the enemy.  Had the guns been able to command the position, they would have fallen by tens and scores.  Major Atherton, in the middle of the square, had his horse shot under him before five minutes were past.  Alas! there was no lack of empty saddles to supply the loss, for before a quarter of an hour had gone by, out of a dozen officers scarcely half remained.  Still they stood, waiting for the first boom of the guns at the head of the pass, and often tempted to break away from their posts and die fighting.  For of all a soldier's duties, that of standing still under fire is the hardest.  Captain Forrester, dashing up the defile at the head of the artillery, had been prepared to find a lively skirmish in progress between his own comrades and the handful of Afghans who were luring them on.  But when, on emerging on to the plain, he found himself and the guns more than half surrounded by the enemy, and no sign anywhere of Atherton, he felt that the \"brush\" was likely to be a very stiff one.  The Afghans had set their hearts on those guns; that was evident by the wild triumphant yell with which they charged down on them.  Forrester had barely time to order a halt and swing the foremost gun into action when a pell-mell scrimmage was going on in the very midst of the gunners.  The first shot fired wildly did little or no execution, but it warned Atherton that his time was come, and signalled to the troops still toiling up the pass what to expect when they got through.  That fight round the guns was the most desperate of the day.  The Afghans knew that to capture them as they stood, meant the certain annihilation of the British troops as they defiled into the plain. Forrester knew it, too.  Unlike Atherton, he had no protected sides.  The enemy was all round him.  The little troop at his command was barely able to cover one side of the square; and the gunners, obliged to fight hand to hand where they stood, were powerless to advance a step.  Every moment was golden. Already a distant bugle-note announced that Atherton's horse had broken loose, and were somewhere within reach--probably cutting their way through the guns.  And within a few minutes the head of the column ascending the defile would also come upon the scene.  Hold the guns till then, and all might yet be safe.  So decided Captain Forrester, as with a cheery smile on his handsome face he shouted to his men to hold out, and fought like a lion beside the foremost gun.  The Afghans, baffled by the stubborn resistance, and aware of the danger of delay, hurled themselves upon that devoted little bond with a fury before which nothing could stand.  Man after man dropped across his gun; but still Forrester shouted to his men and swung his sabre.  It was no time for counting heads.  He hardly knew whether, when he shouted, thirty, or twenty, or only ten shouted back.  All he knew was the enemy had not got the guns yet, and that was sufficient!  A bugle!  Five minutes more, and they might still laugh at the foe.  The bugle-note came from Atherton's men, who at the first sound of the gun had vaulted with a cheer to their horses and dashed towards the sound. Many a brave comrade they left behind them, and many more dropped right and left as they cut their way forward.  Atherton, at their head, peered eagerly through the dust and smoke.  All he could see was a surging mass of human beings, in the midst of which it was impossible to discern anything but the flash of sabres, and at one spot a few British helmets among the turbans of the enemy.  That was enough for Major Atherton. Towards that spot he waved on his men, and ordered his bugler to sound a rousing signal.  The bugler obeyed, and fell at the major's side before the note had well ceased!  The struggle round the guns increased and blackened.  One after another the British helmets went down, and the wild shouts of the Afghans rose triumphantly above them.  At length Atherton saw a tall figure, bareheaded and black with smoke, spring upon a gun-carriage, and with the butt end of a carbine fell two or three of the enemy who scrambled up to dislodge him.  Atherton knew that form among a thousand, and he knew too that Forrester was making his last stand.  \"Cheer, men, and come on!\" cried he to his men, rising in his stirrups and leading the shout.  The head of the column, just then emerging from the gorge, heard that shout, and answered it with a bugle flourish, as they fixed bayonets and rushed forward to charge.  At the same moment, a cheer and the boom of a gun on the left proclaimed that the other half of the column had at that moment reached the plain, and were also bearing down on the enemy's flank.  But Atherton saw and heeded nothing but that tall heroic figure on the carriage.  At the first sound of the troopers' shout Forrester had turned his head, smiling, and raised his carbine aloft, as though to wave answer to the cheer.  So he stood for a moment.  Then he reeled and fell back upon the gun he had saved.    CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.  AN OFFICIAL REPORT.  Scarfe, on the return of the skating party to Wildtree, found himself the hero of the hour.  Whether the risk he ran in rescuing his old schoolfellow from his icy bath had been great or small, it had resulted in saving Jeffreys' life, and that was quite sufficient to make a hero of him.  Percy, easily impressed by the daring of any one else, and quite overlooking his own share in the rescue, was loud in his praises.  \"How jolly proud you must feel!\" said he.  \"I know I should if I'd saved a fellow's life.  That's never my luck!\"  \"You lent a hand,\" said Scarfe, with the complacency of one who can afford to be modest.  And, to do Scarfe justice, until he heard himself credited with the lion's share of the rescue, he had been a little doubtful in his own mind as to how much of it he might justly claim.  \"Oh,\" said Percy, \"a lot I did!  You might as well say Raby lent a hand by lending Jeff her shawl.\"  \"I was the cause of it all,\" said Raby.  \"But you forget dear old Julius; I'm sure he lent a hand.\"  \"The dog was rather in the way than otherwise,\" said Scarfe; \"dogs always are on the ice.\"  Jeffreys, as he walked silently beside them, could afford to smile at this last remark.  But in other respects he found little cause for smiling.  He was not yet a purified being, and even the peril he had been in had not cast out the fires of pride and temper that lurked within him.  It now stung him with an unspeakable misery to find that he was supposed to owe his life to one whom he so thoroughly mistrusted and dreaded as Scarfe.  He persuaded himself that it was all a delusion--that he could easily have extricated himself without anybody's aid but that of the faithful Julius; that Scarfe had run absolutely no risk in crawling out to him on the ladder; that, in short, he owed him nothing--if, indeed, he did not owe him resentment for allowing himself to be credited with a service which he had no right to claim.  Ungrateful and unreasonable, you will say, and certainly not betokening a proper spirit in one so recently in great danger.  Jeffreys, as he walked moodily along, was neither in a grateful nor reasonable mood, nor did he feel chastened in spirit; and that being so, he was too honest to pretend to be what he was not.  To any one less interested, there was something amusing in the manner in which Scarfe took his new and unexpected glory.  At first he seemed to regard it doubtfully, and combated it by one or two modest protestations.  Then, becoming more used to the idea, it pleased him to talk a little about the adventure, and encourage the others to recall the scene.  After that it seemed natural to him to be a little languid and done-up by his exertions, and, as a hero, to establish a claim on Raby's admiration.  And finally, being quite convinced he was a hero of the first water, he regarded Jeffreys with condescension, and felt a little surprise that he should remain both silent and apparently disdainful.  As Raby was beforehand with her in blaming herself, the wind was taken out of Mrs Rimbolt's sails in that quarter, even had she been disposed to let out in that direction.  But it was so much more convenient and natural to blame Jeffreys, that the good lady was never in a moment's doubt upon the subject.  \"How excessively careless of him!\" said she; \"the very one of the party, too, whom we expected to keep out of danger.  It is a mercy every one of you was not drowned.\"  \"It's a mercy he wasn't drowned himself,\" said Percy; \"so he would have been if it hadn't been for Scarfe.\"  \"It was a very noble thing of Mr Scarfe,\" said Mrs Rimbolt.  \"I'm sure, Louisa, my dear, you must be proud of your boy.\"  \"He jolly well deserves a Royal Humane medal, and I mean to write and get him one.\"  \"Don't be a young duffer,\" said the hero, by no means displeased at the threat; \"they would laugh at the notion.\"  \"Would they?  If they didn't give you one, we'd make them laugh on the wrong side of their faces.  I know that,\" replied the boy.  \"You know, auntie, it was I broke the ice,\" said Raby.  \"Mr Jeffreys did not come to that part till he heard it crack.\"  \"That is the ridiculously foolish part of it; he might have known that he ought to keep off when he heard it crack.  Any sensible person would.\"  \"Perhaps,\" said Raby, colouring, \"he imagined I was in danger.\"  \"You are a foolish child, Raby, to talk such nonsense, and should be thankful it was not you who fell in.  I hope, Mr Scarfe,\" added she, \"that Mr Jeffreys is grateful to you for your heroic service to him.\"  \"There is nothing to be grateful for,\" said Scarfe, in an off-hand way; \"indeed, I am afraid Jeffreys is rather offended with me for what I have done than otherwise.\"  \"He could not be so base, my boy,\" said his mother, \"when he owes you his life.\"  \"After all,\" said Scarfe, with interesting resignation, \"it really does not matter.  All I know is, if it were all to happen over again I should do just the same thing.\"  With which noble sentiment the hero was borne off to his room, where a hot bath, warm clothing, a rousing fire, and steaming cordials somewhat consoled him for his self-sacrificing exertions.  After dinner Mrs Rimbolt could not resist the gratification of seeing honour done to her guest by the object of his devotion; a project which was the more easy of accomplishment as Mr Rimbolt was from home on that particular evening.  Jeffreys, just beginning to recover himself by the aid of a little hard work, was petrified by Walker's announcement that \"the mistress desired that Mr Jeffreys would step into the drawing-room.\"  His good breeding was sorely taxed to find an excuse.  He was indisposed, certainly; but if he could work in the library, he could bow and scrape in the drawing-room.  Mr Rimbolt, too, was away, and to insult his lady in his absence seemed both cowardly and mean.  \"I'll come presently,\" said he to Walker, and nerved himself desperately for the ordeal.  For he knew what was coming, and was resolved on the part he would play. Whatever he ought to feel, he knew exactly what he did feel; and he was determined he would not be hypocrite enough to pretend anything more.  Whereupon he walked defiantly forth and opened the drawing-room door, this time without knocking.  \"Mr Jeffreys,\" said Mrs Rimbolt, feeling that the present was an \"occasion,\" and worked up accordingly, \"I have sent for you, as I have no doubt you will wish to express to Mrs Scarfe the feelings you entertain with regard to her son's brave conduct on the ice to-day.\"  \"Hear, hear, ma!\" cried the irreverent Percy, with mock-heroic applause. \"I beg leave to second that.\"  \"Percy, be silent, sir!  Louisa, my dear, this is Mr Jeffreys, whose life your son saved.\"  Mrs Scarfe put up her glasses and inclined her head languidly in response to Jeffreys' stiff bow.  An awkward silence ensued--so awkward that Percy began to whistle.  Mrs Rimbolt having made a wrong start, had not the tact to mend matters.  \"Mrs Scarfe would be interested to hear, Mr Jeffreys,\" said she, after a minute or two, \"your impressions of the accident.\"  \"The only impression I had,\" said Jeffreys solemnly--and he too was worked up, and the master of his nervousness--\"was that the water was very cold.\"  Percy greeted this with a boisterous laugh, which his mother instantly rebuked.  \"Surely, Mr Jeffreys,\" said she severely, \"this is hardly an occasion for a joke.\"  \"It was no joke,\" replied he with dismal emphasis.  Again Percy enjoyed the sport.  \"I should rather think it wasn't by the looks of you when you were fished out!\" said he; \"you were as blue as salmon!\"  \"Percy, cease your vulgar talk in this room, please!\" said Mrs Rimbolt, whose equanimity was beginning to evaporate.  \"Mr Jeffreys, as we are not likely to be amused by your levity--\"  \"Excuse me, madam, I am quite serious,\" said Jeffreys, on whom the apparent jocularity of his last remark had suddenly dawned; \"I had no intention of being rude, or treating your question as a joke.\"  \"Then,\" said Mrs Rimbolt, slightly appeased in the prospect of gaining her object, \"when I tell you Mrs Scarfe is kind enough to desire to hear about the accident from your own lips, perhaps your good manners will permit you to tell her about it.\"  \"Get upon the chair and give us a speech, Jeff,\" said the irrepressible Percy; \"that's what ma wants.\"  Jeffreys proceeded to give his version of the affair, distributing the credit of his rescue in the order in which he considered it to be due, and greatly disappointing both Mrs Rimbolt and her guest by his evident blindness to the heroism of Scarfe.  He acknowledged warmly Percy's readiness to come to his help, and his promptitude in going for the ladder, and he did full justice to Julius's share in the affair.  As to Scarfe's part, he stated just what had happened, without emotion and without effusiveness.  He despised himself for feeling so chilly on the subject, and would have been glad, for Mrs Scarfe's sake, had he felt more warmly his obligations to her son.  But he spoke as he felt.  \"You have had a narrow escape from a watery grave,\" said Mrs Scarfe, anxious to sum up in the hero's favour, \"and my son, I am sure, is thankful to have been the means of saving your life.\"  Jeffreys bowed.  \"I am glad he escaped falling in,\" said he.  \"He had no thought of himself, I am sure,\" said Mrs Rimbolt severely, \"and claims no thanks beyond that of his good conscience.\"  \"We're going to get him a Royal Humane medal, Jeff,\" added Percy; \"a lot of fellows get it for a good deal less.\"  \"I hope he may get one,\" said Jeffreys.  \"You and Julius should have one, too.  I thank you all.\"  This was all that could be extracted from this graceless young man, and the unsatisfactory interview was shortly afterwards terminated by Mrs Rimbolt's requesting him to go and tell Walker to bring some more coals for the fire.  His conduct was freely discussed when he was gone.  Mrs Rimbolt looked upon it as a slight put upon herself, and was proportionately wrathful. Mrs Scarfe, more amiable, imagined that it was useless to look for gratitude among persons of Jeffreys' class in life.  Scarfe himself said that, from what he knew of Jeffreys, he would have been surprised had he shown himself possessed of any good feelings.  Percy, considerably puzzled, suggested that he was \"chawed up with his ducking.\"  And Raby, still more perplexed, said nothing, and hardly knew what to think.  The next day, as Scarfe was smoking in the park, Jeffreys overtook him. A night's rest had a good deal softened the librarian's spirit.  He was ashamed of himself for not having done his rescuer common justice, and had followed him now to tell him as much.  \"Scarfe,\" said he, \"you will have considered I was ungrateful yesterday.\"  \"You were just what I expected you would be.\"  \"I am sorry,\" said Jeffreys, now beginning to feel he had better far have said nothing, yet resolved, now he had begun, to go through with it, \"and I wish to thank you now.\"  Scarfe laughed.  \"It is I who should be grateful for this condescension,\" said he sneeringly.  \"So disinterested, too.\"  \"What do you mean?  How could it be otherwise?\"  \"You have a short memory, Cad Jeffreys.  Possibly you have forgotten a little event that happened at Bolsover?\"  \"I have not forgotten it.\"  \"I dare say you have not thought it worth while to mention it to your employer, Mr Rimbolt.\"  \"I have not mentioned it.\"  \"Quite so.  That is what I mean when I say it is disinterested in you to come and make friends with me.\"  \"That is false,\" said Jeffreys glowing.  \"I neither want nor expect that.\"  \"Kind again.  At the same time you are not particularly anxious that people here should hear the tragical history of young Forrester?\"  \"For heaven's sake be silent, Scarfe!\" said Jeffreys, to whom the mention of the name, after so many months, came like a blow.  \"I cannot bear it.\"  Scarfe laughed.  \"Apparently not.  All I want to say is, that I believe less in your gratitude than in your fear, and you can spare yourself the trouble of keeping up that farce.\"  \"I am not afraid of you,\" said Jeffreys, drawing himself up.  \"Of my own conscience I am; and of the memory of poor young Forrester--\"  \"Hold your tongue.  I have no wish to hear my friend's name on your lips.\"  Jeffreys turned to go.  \"Look here,\" said Scarfe, calling him back, \"I want to say one word.  I am sufficiently interested in Percy Rimbolt to dislike the influence you use upon him.  Your influence upon young boys is not to be trusted, and I warn you to let Percy alone.  You are doing him no good as it is.\"  \"Is that all you want to say?\" said Jeffreys.  \"No.  I have my own reason for choosing that you cease to offend Miss Atherton by your attentions.  You are no fit companion for her; and she and I--\"  Jeffreys turned on his heel, and did not hear the end of the sentence. He marvelled at himself that he had not struck the fellow contemptuously to the ground; and he absolutely smiled in the midst of his misery at the idea of Scarfe taking upon himself the moral upbringing of Percy and the protector-ship of Raby!  In the midst of these reflections he became aware of the presence of Raby in the walk in front of him.  The rencontre was unexpected on both sides, and promised to be embarrassing for Jeffreys.  Raby, however, came to the rescue.  \"Mr Jeffreys,\" said she, holding out her hand, \"I do hope you are none the worse for yesterday.  I was greatly afraid you would catch cold.\"  \"You took the kindest possible way of preventing it,\" said Jeffreys.  \"I never enjoyed a meal as much as the one Walker brought me yesterday, and I thank the kind sender.\"  Raby blushed.  \"It was a shame no one else thought of it.  But, Mr Jeffreys, you are thanking me, when it is I who ought to thank you for risking your life for me.\"  \"That is a new version of the story,\" said Jeffreys.  \"It was somebody else who risked his life for me, and I know you despise me for appearing so churlish about it.\"  \"I was very sorry indeed for you in the drawing-room last night.\"  \"I deserved no sympathy.\"  \"I fancied you might have gushed a little when you saw how much auntie's heart and Mrs Scarfe's were set on it.  It would not have hurt you.\"  \"I cannot gush, Miss Atherton; but I can value your kindness to me, and I do.\"  Raby smiled one of her pleasantest smiles.  \"I wish I had half your honesty, Mr Jeffreys.  I am always pretending to be something here which I am not, and I get sick of it.  I wish I were a man.\"  \"Why?  Is honesty confined to the male sex?\"  \"No; I suppose we can be honest too.  But if I was a man I could go and be of some use somewhere; I'm no good to anybody here.\"  Jeffreys coloured up furiously, and looked as if he would run from the spot.  Then, apparently thinking better of it, he looked down at her and said--  \"Excuse me, you are.\"  They walked on a little in silence, then Raby said--  \"I am so glad, Mr Jeffreys, you managed Percy so well about that smoking yesterday; and how well he took it!\"  \"Of course; he's a gentleman and a fine fellow.\"  \"He forgets how much older Mr Scarfe is than he, and he imagines it is a fine thing to do whatever others do.  But I think it is such a pity he should waste so much time as he does now in the billiard-room and over the fire.  Don't you think it is bad for him?\"  \"I do.  The day on the ice yesterday made a new man of him.\"  \"Do try to coax him out, Mr Jeffreys, you always do him good; and you may be able to pull him up now before he becomes an idler.\"  \"I promise you I will do what I can.\"  \"He ought to be my brother, and not my cousin,\" said Raby, \"I feel so jealous on his account.\"  \"He is fortunate--may I say so?--in his cousin.  Here is Mr Rimbolt.\"  Mr Rimbolt had papers in his hand, and looked rather anxious.  Raby, with a daughter's instinct, rushed to him.  \"Uncle, have you news from the war?  Is anything wrong?\"  \"Nothing wrong,\" said her uncle reassuringly; \"I brought you this paper to see.  It reports that there has been an encounter with the Afghans near Kandahar, with complete success on the British side and comparatively trifling loss.  Particulars are expected almost immediately.  I telegraphed to town to get the earliest possible details.  Meanwhile, Raby, don't alarm yourself unduly.\"  \"I won't, uncle; but where exactly was the battle?\"  \"You will see the names mentioned in the telegram.  Jeffreys can show you the exact spot in the atlas; we were looking at it the other evening.\"  Jeffreys thankfully accepted the task.  He and Raby spent an hour over the map, talking of the absent soldier, and trying, the one to conceal, the other to allay, the anxiety which the incomplete telegram had aroused.  At the end of the hour Scarfe walked into the library.  His face darkened as he saw the two who sat there.  \"Miss Atherton,\" said he, looking not at her, but at Jeffreys, \"have you forgotten we were to have a ride this morning?\"  \"I am so sorry, Mr Scarfe, but I have a headache, and don't feel as if I could ride to-day.  You will excuse me, won't you?\"  \"Oh, certainly,\" replied Scarfe; \"don't you think a turn in the park will do you good?  May I have the pleasure of escorting you?\"  Raby said, \"Thank you.\"  She was very sorry to disappoint any one, and had no valid excuse against a walk.  \"Miss Atherton,\" said Scarfe, when they had gone some distance, chatting on indifferent topics, \"I am anxious just to say a word to you, not in my own interest at all, but your own.  Will you forgive me if I do?\"  \"What is it?\" said Raby, mystified.  \"I wish to put you on your guard against Jeffreys, who, I see, presumes on his position here to annoy you.  You may not perhaps know, Miss Atherton, that not two years ago--\"  \"Excuse me, Mr Scarfe,\" said Raby quietly, stopping in her walk, \"I hate talking of people behind their backs.  Mr Jeffreys has never annoyed me; he has been kind to me.  Shall we talk of something else?\"  \"Certainly,\" said Scarfe, startled at her decided tone.  He had laid his plan for a little revelation, and it disconcerted him to see it knocked on the head like this.  However, just then he was not in the humour for making himself obnoxious to Miss Atherton, of whom, being a susceptible youth, he was decidedly enamoured.  It was a deprivation, certainly, to find his tongue thus unexpectedly tied with regard to Jeffreys, of whose stay at Wildtree he had calculated on making very short work.  The one comfort was, that there was little enough danger of her seeing in the ill-favoured Bolsover cad anything which need make him--Scarfe-- jealous.  Doubtless she took a romantic interest in this librarian; many girls have whims of that sort.  But the idea of her preferring him to the smart Oxford hero was preposterous.  Jeffreys would still believe in the sword of Damocles which hung above him, and the time might come when Raby would cease to stand between him and his Nemesis.    CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.  WILD PIKE.  Before breakfast on the following morning, Scarfe, in fulfilment of a long-standing engagement with a college friend to spend a day with him, rode off to catch the train at Overstone, and consequently was not present when the post arrived, and with it a telegram from London for Mr Rimbolt.  Raby, who had been on the watch, could scarcely allow her uncle time to examine its contents before claiming it; and had it contained bad news, the chance of breaking them would have been out of the question.  But it did not contain bad news.  On the contrary, as Raby devoured the few official lines she became radiant with pride and happiness.  The telegram was a copy of a dispatch received the evening before at the War Office:--  \"News is to hand of a sharp brush with the Afghans on the 4th inst. at ---, two days' march from Kandahar.  About mid-day the--Hussars, commanded by Major Atherton, in advance of the main body, encountered and dislodged from a defile on the right bank of the river a considerable body of the enemy, who fled to the plain.  It becoming evident the enemy was at hand in force, a battery of field guns was pushed forward, under the escort of a troop of Hussars; and the main body followed in two columns.  The cavalry meanwhile, having cleared the defile and chased the enemy into the plain beyond, became involved in a desperate scrimmage, the Afghans having descended in full force into the plain with the evident intention of cutting them off from the main body. Major Atherton, completely hemmed in, made a desperate stand, in which upwards of twenty of his men perished, the gallant officer himself having his horse shot under him.  The guns meanwhile, escorted by Captain Forrester, of the--Hussars, gained the head of the defile, where they were immediately surrounded by the enemy.  A brilliant resistance here ensued, in which more than half of the escort were killed in their effort to save the guns.  Towards the end, Captain Forrester nearly single-handed kept the enemy at bay until the cavalry, breaking through, and joining forces with the two columns of the main body as they emerged on the plain, effectually turned the position and saved the guns.  The loss of the enemy was very considerable, and it is considered that this action clears the way to Kandahar, which the troops are expected to occupy in two days without further resistance.  Our loss, considering the perilous position of the cavalry and gunners, was comparatively slight.  Captain Forrester at the last moment fell after a resistance as heroic as any witnessed in the course of the campaign.  Major Atherton received a scratch on the wrist; which, however, is not likely to disable him even temporarily.  The main body never came into action at all, and suffered no casualties.  A full list of the killed and wounded is appended.\"  Jeffreys, who found himself almost as eager for news as if he had been personally interested, found it difficult to wait patiently until Mr Rimbolt came after breakfast to the library.  \"Is there news from the war?\" he asked.  \"Yes--good news, Miss Atherton has the telegram.  Her father took part in a very brilliant engagement a day or two ago, which appears to have cleared the way to Kandahar.  He was scratched, but not seriously.\"  Jeffreys received this good news with great satisfaction.  It was a relief to him to hear it in the first instance not from Raby's lips, for he never knew what to do or say on such occasions.  \"Miss Atherton must be very proud,\" said he, returning to his work.  He was not, however, destined to remain long undisturbed.  Raby, radiant and excited, entered the library a few minutes later.  \"Mr Jeffreys,\" said she, \"such splendid news.  Has uncle told you?  I thought you would like to read the telegram; here it is.\"  Jeffreys looked his congratulations as he took the paper.  \"Read it aloud, Mr Jeffreys,\" said the happy girl, \"I should like to hear how it sounds.\"  Jeffreys smiled and began to read; Raby, who knew it all by heart, seeming to check off every word.  Suddenly, however, in the middle of the narrative the reader started and changed colour, and became unaccountably breathless.  \"The guns meanwhile, escorted by--\" he had got so far.  \"`Captain Forrester of the--Hussars.'  Go on,\" said Raby.  It needed all his self-command to finish the reading, and when he came to the end and handed back the paper, Raby perceived that his hand shook and his face was deadly pale.  \"Why, what is the matter, Mr Jeffreys?\" said she, suddenly alarmed herself; \"it is good news, isn't it? and he has only got a scratch!\"  \"Yes, it is good news; and I congratulate you.\"  \"But you look--perhaps you know some one who has been killed.  You never told me you had any friend out there.\"  \"I have not.  I think I must be not quite well; will you excuse me?\"  And he went out into the open air, leaving Raby very much perplexed and concerned.  She was relieved, however, to see him half an hour later starting off with Percy for what, to judge by their mountain boots and the luncheon box strapped across Jeffreys' shoulders, promised to be a long walk.  Jeffreys' first sensations on finding himself alone had been those of stupefaction.  Although all that he knew of Forrester's father was that he had been in India, it never occurred to him now for a moment that the gallant officer mentioned in the telegram could be any other than the father whom he had so cruelly and irreparably wronged.  And now once more he seemed suddenly face to face with his crime.  He saw before him that fatal scene in the Bolsover meadow; he heard his comrades' howl of execration and saw the boy's white face on the grass turned up to meet his.  It seemed but yesterday.  Nay, it seemed all to be there that moment; he could feel the keen breeze on his cheek; his eye rested on the boy's cap where he had flung it; he was conscious of Mr Freshfield's look of horror--he could even see twenty yards away the football lying idle between the goals.  Strange, that the doubtful mention of an officer's name should call it all up thus!  But so it was.  He even seemed half guilty of that gallant death in Afghanistan.  Had he not wronged him worse than death? and now if anywhere the friendless boy, whose whole hope was in his father, should read those lines and find himself orphaned as well as crippled!  Jeffreys in his misery groaned aloud.  \"Hullo,\" said Percy, in the path before him, \"you in the blues too! What a jolly sell!  Here am I as miserable as an owl, and everybody I meet's miserable too.  Scarfe's gone to Sharpfield, and won't be back till late.  Raby's so taken up with her precious telegram that she won't look at me.  Ma and Mrs Scarfe, have bagged the pony trap and Appleby, and now you're looking as if you'd just been hung.\"  \"What are you in the blues about?\" said Jeffreys, brightening up a bit.  \"Oh, everything.  It's so slow here, nothing to do.  Can't play games all day, and you won't let me smoke, and the library hasn't a single story worth reading, and it's beastly cold; and upon my word,\" said the boy, who was genuinely miserable, \"I'd as soon go and sit on the top of Wild Pike as fool about here.\"  \"The best thing you could do--I'll go and sit with you,\" said Jeffreys.  \"What!\" said the boy, \"do you mean it?  Will you come?\"  \"Of course I will; I have nothing special to do to-day, and I've never been up a mountain in winter before.\"  \"We shall get a splendid view.  Sure it won't grind you?\" said the boy, who, under Scarfe's influence, had come to look upon every exertion as a thing to be shirked.  \"My dear fellow, I shall enjoy it, especially with you,\" said Jeffreys.  \"Hurrah--bring Julius too--and I'll get some grub to take.  It's only ten now, and it's not dark till after four, so we have a good six hours.\"  A few minutes later they started, Percy leaving word for his mother that they were going for a long tramp, and would be back for dinner.  It was a perfect winter's day.  The air was keen and frosty and promised magnificent views.  The wind was not strong enough to be benumbing, and the sun overhead was cheering and now and then even warm.  \"Hadn't we better take overcoats, in case it comes on cold at the top?\" said Jeffreys as they were starting.  \"Oh no--they're a frightful grind to carry, and we are sure to be baked before we get up.\"  \"I think I will take mine,\" said Jeffreys, \"and it will be no bother to carry yours.\"  Percy protested, but, luckily for them, Jeffreys carried his point.  Wild Pike was one of those mountains, not uncommon in that district, which are approached from the back by a long gradual slope, but on the front present a scooped-out precipitous face, as if broken in half on that side.  It was this steeper side which faced Wildtree, and Percy would have scorned to approach the monster from any other quarter.  From where they stood the narrow path zigzagged for about one thousand feet onto one of the upper shoulders of the mountain.  Following this, the track brought them to what seemed like the basin of some old volcano hollowed out under the summit.  It was necessary to cross this depression, and by a narrow ledge at the foot of the great cliff gain the other side, where another zigzag ascent brought them onto the rocky slope leading over a quarter of a mile of huge boulders to the summit.  The passage across the face of the mountain was the most difficult part of the ascent.  It lay along a narrow ledge hanging, so it seemed, half- way down the perpendicular cliff which rose out of the hollow, crater- like basin sheer up to the summit.  It was tolerably level, but the narrowness of the track and the precipitous height above and below called for a cool head and a steady foot.  In frosty weather like the present it needed special caution, and every step had to be carefully judged on the treacherous path.  However, they passed it safely.  Julius alone seemed to find it difficult.  The dog was strangely awkward to-day.  He slid about where the others walked steadily, and whimpered at obstacles which they seemed scarcely to heed.  \"Now for the grub,\" cried Percy, as they landed safely on the other side.  \"I say, Jeff, I call that something like a mountain, don't you? I'm quite sorry we're over the worst of it, aren't you?\"  \"We've got the view to see yet,\" responded Jeffreys.  \"We shall be up in half an hour.\"  \"And it will take us as long to come down as to go up to-day,\" said Jeffreys, \"so we ought not to lose much time.\"  Off they started again after a hurried but highly appreciated meal, in which the dog took only a very moderate share.  The remaining portion of the ascent was simple enough.  The zigzag onto the top shoulder was if anything less steep than the lower one, and the path, being rougher underfoot, was less treacherous.  The scramble over the loose rocks at the top onto the cairn was not altogether plain sailing.  In summer it was easy enough, but now, with the surface of the great boulders as slippery as glass, it was hardly to be traversed except on the hands and knees.  Poor Julius floundered about pitifully, unable to keep his feet, and disappearing bodily now and then among the interstices of the rocky way. Even Percy and Jeffreys stumbled once or twice awkwardly, and reached the summit with bruised limbs.  But _finis coronat opus_, especially on a mountain.  As they sprang up the cairn a view unequalled in grandeur broke upon them.  The frosty air was without haze in any quarter.  The Scotch hills beyond the border and the broad heaving sea lay apparently equally within reach, and on the farthest western horizon even the fairy-like outline of the distant Irish hills, never visible except in the clearest winter weather, shone out distinctly.  \"Isn't it scrumptious?\" exclaimed Percy, as he flung himself breathless onto the cairn.  \"If we had waited a year we couldn't have picked out such a day.  Why, that must be Snowdon we see over there, and the high ground out at sea, Holyhead?\"  Thus they went on, delightedly recognising the landmarks north, south, east, and west, and forgetting both the hour and the rising breeze.  \"Why, it's two o'clock!\" cried Percy presently, looking at his watch, and shivering at the same time.  \"Put on your coat,\" said Jeffreys; \"the wind's getting up a bit, and we shall have it in our faces going down.\"  As they started to descend they became aware of a sudden change in the hitherto cloudless day.  The western horizon, which had just now been unfolding its distant beauties, seemed lost in a fine haze, which spread north and south, blotting out one after another the glories of landscape on which they had scarcely ceased to feast their eyes.  \"There's a mist out there,\" said Percy, as they scrambled down the boulders; \"I hope to goodness it will keep away from us.\"  \"The wind is a little north-west; it may drive it south of us, but it is spreading at a great rate.\"  \"Never mind; it will be rather a joke if it comes.  I could find the way down with my eyes shut, and I've often wanted to be in a regular fog up here,\" said Percy.  \"I don't know what you feel,\" responded Jeffreys; \"but I'm rather glad we brought our coats.  Isn't it cold?\"  The wind which met them seemed charged with cold, and after a while began to scatter a feathery sleet in their faces.  Percy whistled.  \"We didn't bargain for that, I say,\" said he.  \"I hope it shuts up before we cross over the ledge down there.\"  Julius howled dismally.  He, too, guessed what this blinding shower-bath foreboded, and stumbled along, miserable and shivering.  The higher zigzag, which had seemed easy enough two hours ago, tried them sorely now.  The sleet half blinded them, and the fresh moisture, freezing as it fell, caused them to slip and slide at every step.  Still they got down it somehow, and turned to face the narrow track along the cliff.  Percy, much as he repined at the change in the elements, felt no doubt as to the possibility of getting over.  \"We may have to crawl a bit of the way if this sort of thing goes on,\" said he, \"but it's straight enough sailing.\"  \"Would it be better,\" suggested Jeffreys, \"to go to the top again and get down by the Sharpenholme track?\"  \"We shouldn't get home till midnight if we did; besides, I don't know the way.  We're all right this way if we look sharp.\"  The wind had now increased to a tempest, and beat against the side of the great cliff with a sound like the sea breaking on an iron-bound shore.  They could scarcely hear one another speak; and poor Julius's whines were drowned in the great clamour.  \"Do you mind my going first?\" said Percy; \"I know the path better than you.\"  Jeffreys nodded, and they started.  The first step they took on that ledge threatened for a moment to be their last.  The wind, gathering fury every moment, beat Percy to his knees, and nearly sent Jeffreys staggering over the ledge.  \"We shall have to crawl,\" said Percy.  \"It's no use waiting.  The wind and sleet are going to make a night of it, and we shall gain nothing by waiting.\"  The start was begun again--this time cautiously and on all-fours.  Even so the wind seemed once or twice as if it would sweep them from the ledge.  Yard by yard they crawled on.  The driving mist fell like a pall over the mountain, and in a few minutes they could not even see a yard in front of them.  Had the wind blown crosswise, or in any other way than that in which it came, they would have been swept off before twenty yards were accomplished.  As it was, they were almost pinned to the cliff by the fury of the blast.  They must have proceeded a quarter of the way across, and had reached a spot where the ledge rose slightly.  Even up this slight incline, with the mist freezing under them, it was impossible to crawl; and Percy, drawing himself cautiously to his feet, attempted to stand.  As he did so, the wind, gathering itself into a furious blast, caught him and hurled him against the rocky wall.  He recoiled with a sharp cry of pain, and next moment would have fallen into the abyss beneath, had not Jeffreys' strong arm caught him and held him.  His legs were actually off the ledge, and for a moment it seemed as if both he and his protector were doomed.  But with a tremendous effort the prostrate Jeffreys swung him back onto the track.  \"Are you hurt?\" he called.  \"My arm,\" said Percy.  \"I'm afraid I can't get on.  I'll try.\"  But the attempt only called up a fresh exclamation of pain.  \"We must wait,\" said Jeffreys.  \"Try to sit up, old fellow.  I'll help you.\"  It was evident that the boy's arm, if not broken, was so severely damaged as to render it powerless.  \"I could stay here, I think,\" said he, \"if you went on, Jeff.\"  \"Nonsense!\" said Jeffreys; \"we'll send Julius to fetch help.  Here, Julius, good dog,\" said he, patting the dog's head and pointing down to the valley, \"go and fetch them here.  Fetch Appleby, and Walker, and Mr Rimbolt.  Go along, good fellow.\"  The dog, who had been crawling behind them, looked wistfully at his master and licked the hand that caressed him.  Then, stepping carefully across them as they sat with their backs to the rock and their feet beyond the edge of the path, he departed.  He was out of sight almost a yard away, but they heard him whine once as the wind dashed him against the cliff.  \"Julius, good dog, fetch them!\" shouted Jeffreys into the mist.  A faint answering bark came back.  Next moment, through the storm, came a wild howl, and they heard him no more.  Jeffreys guessed only too well what that howl meant; but he never stirred, as with his arm round Percy, and his cloak screening him from the wind, he looked hopelessly out into the night and waited.    CHAPTER NINETEEN.  SCARFE PROMISES TO REMEMBER.  \"Jeff,\" said Percy, after a minute or two, \"it's nonsense your staying here to get frozen; do go on.\"  \"No, old fellow; I prefer your company to my own.\"  \"But, Jeff, we may not last out till the morning.\"  \"We won't give it up yet, though.\"  Jeffreys had great faith in the caloric of hope, especially for a boy of Percy's temperament.  For himself he saw enough to guess that their position was a desperate one. The ledge on which they sat was narrow and slanting, and the wind, shifting gradually to the west, began to get round them menacingly, and cause them now and then to grip at the stones while some specially furious gust blew past.  Add to that, Percy's arm was probably broken, and, despite a makeshift bandage and sling, adjusted at imminent peril of being swept away in the operation, increasingly painful.  The mist wrapped them like a winding-sheet, and froze as it fell.  \"How long will Julius take getting down?\" asked the boy.  \"Not long,\" said Jeffreys, with a shudder, not wholly caused by the cold.  \"An hour?  He could bring them up in three hours, couldn't he?\"  \"Less, perhaps.  We can hold out for three hours.\"  \"Jeff, old fellow, do go; what _is_ the use of you staying?\"  \"Harder work for the wind to lift two of us than one.  It can't last long, I'm certain; it's chopping already.\"  They relapsed into silence, and listened to the storm as it dashed on the cliffs above them.  A quarter of an hour passed.  Then Jeffreys felt the boy's head drop on his shoulder.  \"Percy, old man, no sleeping,\" said he, raising his head.  \"I'm not sleeping; only wondering where Julius is.\"  But his voice was drowsy, and the words drawled out slowly and dreamily.  \"Perhaps he's down the lower zigzag now,\" said Jeffreys, giving his companion a shake, under pretext of readjusting the wraps.  \"I guess he'll go to Raby first,\" said Percy.  \"Won't she be scared?\"  \"She will probably go to your father, and he'll get Appleby and Kennedy and some of the men, and they'll--Percy! hold up your head!\"  \"Scarfe would like to get engaged to Raby, but she would sooner--\"  \"Percy, old man, you're talking rubbish.  Unless you sit up and keep awake we shall both come to grief.\"  \"I'll try,\" said the boy, \"but I don't know how.\"  \"Tell me something about your year at Rugby.  I want to hear about it so much.  What form were you in?\"  Then followed a desperate half-hour of cross-examination, Jeffreys coming down with a question at the slightest symptom of drowsiness, and Percy, with all the cunning of a \"somno-maniac,\" taking time to think before each answer, and even shirking a syllable here or there in order to snatch a wink.  The daylight slowly faded out of the mist, but still the wind howled and shook them on their narrow perch at every gust.  Jeffreys, with dismay, found his limbs growing cramped and stiff, boding ill, unless relief soon came, for the possibility of moving at all.  Surely, though, the wind was abating.  The dash overhead sounded a trifle less deafening; and the driving sleet, which an hour ago had struck on their faces, now froze their ears.  Yes, the wind was shifting and falling.  In the half-minute which it took Jeffreys to make this discovery Percy had once more fallen asleep, and it required a shake more prolonged than ever to arouse him.  \"What!\" said he, as he slowly raised his head, \"are they here?  Is father there?\"  \"No, old boy, but the wind is going down, and we may be able to move soon.  Where did you field in that cricket match you were telling me of?\"  \"Short leg, and I made two catches.\"  \"Bravo!  Were they hard ones?  Tell me.\"  So for another half-hour this struggle with sleep went on.  Jeffreys had more to do than keep his companion awake.  He accompanied every question with a change of position of his knees and arms, that he might be able when the time came to use his limbs.  It was little enough scope he had for any movement on that narrow ledge, but he lost no chance, and his self-imposed fidgets helped not only himself but Percy.  At last the roar on the cliffs changed into a surly soughing, and the gusts edged slowly but surely round behind the great buttress of the mountain.  \"Percy,\" said Jeffreys, \"we must try a move.  Can you hold yourself steady while I try to get up?\"  Percy was wide awake in an instant.  \"I can hold on, but my other arm is no good for scrambling.\"  \"I'll see to that, only hold on while I get up.\"  It was a long and painful operation; every joint and muscle seemed to be congealed.  At length, however, by dint of a terrible effort, he managed to draw up his feet and even to stand on the path.  He kicked up the earth so as to make a firm foothold, and then addressed himself to the still more difficult task of raising the stiff and crippled Percy.  How he did it, and how he half dragged, half carried him back along the ledge to the firmer ground of the upper zigzag path, he never knew.  He always counted it as one of the miracles of his life, the work of that stronger than human arm which had already helped him along his path, and which in this act showed that it still was with him.  To stand even on that steep mountain path was, after the peril of that fearful ledge, like standing on a broad paved road.  \"Where next?\" said Percy.  \"Over the top and down by the Sharpenholme track.  Do you see the moon is coming out through the mist?\"  \"All serene!\"  The heroism of that night's adventure was not all absorbed by the elder traveller.  The boy who with indomitable hopefulness toiled up that steep ascent with a broken arm bandaged to his side, making nothing of his pain, was a type of English boy happily still to be met with, giving promise of men of the right stuff yet to come to maintain the good name of their country.  They were not much in the humour for admiring the wonderful beauty of the scene as the mist gradually cleared and above them rose the full white moon flooding the mountain and the hills beyond with its pure light.  They welcomed the light, for it showed them the way; but they would have sold the view twenty times over for a pot of hot coffee.  At the top they met the tail end of the gale spending its little remaining force on the mountain's back.  It seemed like a balmy zephyr compared with the tempest of a few hours ago.  The descent down the broad grass track with its slight covering of snow towards Sharpenholme had little difficulty; but the jolting tried Percy's arm as the steep climb with all its exertion had not done.  Jeffreys noticed the boy's steps become more unsteady, and felt him lean with increasing heaviness on his arm.  \"Percy, old boy, you are done up.\"  \"No--I--Suppose we rest a minute or two; I shall be all right.\"  But while he spoke he staggered faintly and would have fallen but for Jeffreys' arm in his.  \"I think if you went on,\" said he, \"I could rest a bit and follow slowly.\"  Jeffreys' answer was curt and decisive.  He took the boy up in his arms as if he had been a baby, and, despite all protestations, carried him.  On level ground and under ordinary circumstances it would have been a simple matter.  For Jeffreys was brawny and powerful; and the light weight of the slender, wiry boy was nothing to him.  But on that slippery mountain-side, after the fatigue and peril of the afternoon, it was as much as he could do to stagger forward under the burden.  Yet--was it quite unnatural?--a strange sort of happiness seemed to take possession of him as he felt this helpless boy's form in his arms, the head drooped on his shoulder, and the poor bruised arm tenderly supported in his hand.  There seemed hope in the burden; and in that brotherly service a promise of expiation for another still more sacred service which had been denied him!  He tramped down that long gradual slope in a contented dream, halting often to rest, but never losing heart.  Percy, too exhausted to remonstrate, yielded himself gratefully, and lay only half conscious in his protector's arms, often fancying himself at home in bed or lolling idly in the summer fields.  It may have been midnight, or later still, when Jeffreys, looking beyond the shadows projected by the moon in front of him, perceived a gleam of light far down in the valley.  \"Probably,\" thought he, \"some honest shepherd, after his day's work, is happily going to rest.  Think of a bed, and a pillow, and a blanket!\"  But no, the light--the lights, there were two--were moving--moving rapidly and evenly.  Jeffreys stood still to listen.  The wind had long since dropped into rest, and the clear night air would have carried a sound twice the distance.  Yes, it was a cart or a carriage, and he could even detect the clatter of the horses on the hard road.  Possibly some benighted wagoner, or a mail cart.  He raised a shout which scared the sleeping rabbits in their holes and made the hill across the valley wake with echoes.  The lights still moved on.  He set Percy down tenderly on the grass with his coat beneath him.  Then, running with all his speed, he halved the distance which separated him and the road, and shouted again.  This time the clatter of the hoofs stopped abruptly and the lights stood still.  Once more he shouted, till the night rang with echoes.  Then, joyful sound! there rose from the valley an answering call, and he knew all was safe.  In a few minutes he was back again where Percy, once more awake, was sitting up, bewildered, and listening to the echoes which his repeated shouts still kept waking.  \"It's all right, old fellow; there's a carriage.\"  \"They've come to look for us.  I can walk, Jeff, really.\"  \"Are you sure?\"  \"Yes, and they'd be so scared if they saw me being carried.\"  So they started forward, the answering shouts coming nearer and nearer at every step.  \"That's Appleby,\" said Percy, as a particularly loud whoop fell on their ears.  It was, and with him Mr Rimbolt and Scarfe.  When darkness came, and no signs of the pedestrians, the usual uneasiness had prevailed at Wildtree, increased considerably by Walker's and Raby's report as to the mountaineering garb in which the missing ones had started.  The terrible tempest which had attacked the face of Wild Pike had swept over Wildtree too, and added a hundredfold to the alarm which, as hour passed hour, their absence caused.  Scarfe, arriving at home about ten o'clock, found the whole family in a state of panic.  Mr Rimbolt had been out on the lower slopes of the mountain, and reported that a storm raged there before which nothing could stand. The only hope was that they had been descending the back of the mountain, and taken refuge somewhere in the valley for the night.  The carriage was ordered out, and Mr Rimbolt and Scarfe started on what seemed a forlorn hope.  For an hour or two they passed and repassed the valley road, inquiring at every cottage and farm without result.  At last, just as they were resolving to give it up for the night, Appleby pulled up the horses suddenly, and said he had heard a shout. Instantly they jumped out and shouted back; and now, following the direction of the voice, far up the great slope, they _met_ Jeffreys, with the boy leaning on his arm safe, but almost exhausted.  Neither of them retained a vivid recollection of that drive home. Jeffreys was vaguely conscious of them calling on the way for the doctor, and taking him along in the carriage.  He also heard Scarfe say something to Mr Rimbolt in tones of commiseration, in which something was added about the inconsiderateness and untrustworthiness of Jeffreys. But for the rest he reclined back in his seat, scarcely conscious of anything but the rest and warmth.  At Wildtree, the now familiar scene of the whole household gathered panic-struck an the threshold drove him precipitately to his room.  He knew what to expect if he stayed there.  Jeffreys dropped asleep with the dog's howl ringing weirdly in his ears. In his dreams it seemed to change into that still more terrible howl which had stunned him long ago on the Bolsover meadow.  It followed him as he carried young Forrester in his arms across that fatal ledge.  It was pitch dark; and on the ledge Scarfe stood to drive him back.  Then suddenly a new bright path seemed to open at his side, into which he stepped with his precious burden.  And as he did so he saw, far off, Raby standing at the end of the way.  It was ten o'clock when he awoke; but the house was still asleep.  Only a few servants were stirring; and even Walker had taken advantage of the occasion to \"sleep in.\"  Jeffreys was tough and hardy; and the night's rest had done more for him than twenty doctors.  He got up, shook himself, and behold his limbs were strong under him, and his head was clear and cool.  He dressed himself quietly and descended to the kitchen, where he begged an early breakfast of the servants.  Then he sallied forth with his stick towards Wild Pike.  The grand pile on this bright winter's morning looked almost hypocritically serene and benignant.  The sunlight bathed the stern cliff which yesterday had buffeted back the wind with a roar as fierce as itself; and in the quiet spring-like air the peaceful bleating of sheep was the only sound to be heard on the steep mountain-side.  But Jeffreys did not turn his steps upward.  On the contrary, he kept to the lowest track in the valley, and took the path which led him nearest to the base of that terrible wall of rock.  A hard scramble over the fallen stones brought him to a spot where, looking up, the top of the wall frowned down on him from a sheer height of five hundred feet, while half-way down, like a narrow scratch along the face of the cliff, he could just detect the ledge on which last night they had sat out the storm.  There, among the stones, shattered and cold, lay all that remained of the brave Julius.  His fate must have overtaken him before he had gone twenty yards on his desperate errand, and almost before that final howl reached his master's ears all must have been over.  Jeffreys, as he tenderly lifted his lost friend in his arms, thought bitterly and reproachfully of the dog's strange conduct yesterday--his evident depression and forebodings of evil--the result, no doubt, of illness, but making that last act of self-devotion all the more heroic.  He made a grave there at the base of that grand cliff, and piled up a little cairn to mark the last resting-place of his friend.  Then, truly a mourner, he returned slowly to Wildtree.  At the door he encountered Mrs Rimbolt, who glared at him and swept past.  \"How is Percy this morning?\" he inquired.  \"No thanks to you, Mr Jeffreys,\" said the lady, with a double venom in her tones, \"he is alive.\"  \"His arm, is it--?\"  \"Go to your work, sir,\" said the lady; \"I have no wish to speak to you.\"  Jeffreys bowed and retreated.  He had expected such a reception, and just now it neither dismayed nor concerned him.  On the staircase he met Raby.  She looked pale and anxious, but brightened up as she saw him.  \"Mr Jeffreys,\" said she, \"are you really up, and none the worse?\"  \"I am well, thank you,\" said he, \"but very anxious to hear about Percy.\"  \"He has had a bad night with his arm, but the doctor says he is going on all right.  What a terrible adventure you had.  Percy told me a little of it.  Oh, Mr Jeffreys, it is all my fault!\"  Jeffreys could not help smiling.  \"By what stretch of ingenuity do you make that out?\"  \"It was I suggested your coaxing Percy out, you know; I might have been the death of you both.\"  \"You did not send the wind, did you, or the mist?  If you did, of course you are quite entitled to all the credit.\"  \"Don't laugh about it, please.  Percy was telling me how if it had not been for you--\"  \"He would never have been in any danger.  Perhaps he is right.  By the way.  Miss Atherton, is there any chance of seeing him?\"  \"He has asked for you already; but auntie, I believe, would have a fit if you went near him.  She seems to consider you are his evil genius; instead of being just the opposite.  Tell me how Julius is--he went with you, did he not?\"  \"I have been out this morning to bury Julius at the place where he fell.\"  Raby, already unduly excited by the events of the past few days, broke into tears, and at the same moment Scarfe, descending the stairs, stood before them.  He looked first at Jeffreys, next at the girl.  Then, taking her arm, he said--  \"What is the matter?  May I take you downstairs?\"  \"Oh no,\" she cried, pushing away his hand, and dashing the tears from her eyes.  \"Mr Jeffreys, I am so sorry, do forgive me!\" and she ran upstairs to her own room.  Jeffreys and Scarfe stood facing one another.  \"What is the meaning of this?\" said the latter wrathfully.  \"It would not interest you.  I was telling Miss Atherton about my dog.\"  \"Hang your dog!  Did not I tell you that I did not choose for you to obtrude yourself on Raby?\"  \"You did, and I should be sorry to obtrude myself on any one, whether you choose it or not.\"  \"You appear to forget, Cad Jeffreys--\"  \"I forget nothing--not even that I am keeping you from your breakfast.\"  And he quitted the scene.  Later in the morning, as he was working in the library, Mr Rimbolt entered and greeted him cordially.  \"Jeffreys, my dear fellow, you are constantly adding new claims on my gratitude.  What can I say to you now to thank you for your heroism yesterday, about which Percy has just told us?\"  \"Pray say nothing, and discount Percy's story heavily, for he was the hero.  With his broken arm and in all the danger he never lost heart for a moment.\"  \"Yes, he is a brave boy, too.  But I came now to tell you he is asking for you.  Will you come and see him?\"  Jeffreys followed the father gratefully to the sick-chamber.  At the door he encountered Mrs Rimbolt, who, having evidently been present at the boy's narrative, was pleased to regard him almost graciously, and, delightfully ignoring the previous encounter, to wish him good morning. Percy looked hot and feverish, but brightened up at once as he caught sight of his protector.  \"Hullo, old Jeff,\" said he, \"isn't this all nonsense?  They say I'm in for a mild congestion, and shall have to stick in bed for a fortnight. Just sit down; do you mind, and stay with me.  You've pulled me through so far; you may as well finish the job.\"  Thus informally, and without consulting anybody, Jeffreys was constituted nurse-in-chief in the sick-chamber.  The boy would tolerate no discussion or protest on the part of the authorities.  He must have old Jeff.  Bother a hospital nurse, bother the doctor, bother Scarfe, bother everybody.  He wanted Jeff; and if Jeff couldn't come he didn't mean to take his medicine or do anything he ought to do.  Walker had better put up a chair-bed in the dressing-room for Jeff, and Jeff and he (Percy) could have their grub together.  Of course all the others could come and see him, especially Raby--but he meant to have Jeff there for good, and that was flat.  Thus this selfish young invalid arranged for his own pleasure, and upset all the sober arrangements of his friends.  Jeffreys delightedly accepted his new duty, and faced the jealousy of Mrs Rimbolt and Scarfe unflinchingly.  It was certainly an unfortunate position for the fond mother; and little wonder if in her mind Jeffreys' brave service should be blotted out in the offence of being preferred before herself in the sick-chamber.  She readily lent an ear to the insinuations which Scarfe, also bitterly hurt, freely let out, and persuaded herself miserably that her boy was in the hands of an adventurer who had cajoled not only the boy but the father, and in short personated the proverbial viper at the fireside.  So the fortnight passed.  Percy turned the corner; and the time for the departure of Mrs Scarfe and her son drew near.  Percy on the evening before they went had been less bright than usual, and had alarmed Jeffreys by a slight return of feverishness.  He had just dropped off to sleep, and seemed about to settle quietly for the night, when the door opened and Scarfe came in.  Jeffreys was there in an instant with his hand raised in warning.  \"Hush, please,\" said he, \"he has just gone over.\"  \"Whom are you telling to hush? you canting brute!\" said Scarfe, raising his voice in a passion unusual for him.  \"Let me come in, do you hear?\"  And he moved forward, as if to force his way into the room.  Jeffreys caught him by the two elbows and lifted him bodily out into the landing, and then stood with his back to the door.  Scarfe, livid with rage, made no attempt to get back into the room. Turning on his adversary, he said between his teeth--  \"I shall remember this,\" and departed.    CHAPTER TWENTY.  A POLITE LETTER-WRITER.  Scarfe descended to the drawing-room, where he found Mrs Rimbolt alone.  \"I am so sorry you are going,\" said she.  \"Your visit has been greatly spoiled, I fear.  You must come to us at Easter, when we shall be in London, you know.\"  \"Thank you; I shall be glad to come.  I hope to find Percy well again. I went to wish him good-bye just now, but was pretty abruptly denied admission, so I must ask you to say good-bye for me.\"  \"Dear me, it is very annoying.  I cannot understand the craze the boy has taken for this companion of his.  I am so sorry you should have been annoyed.\"  \"I assure you I am far more annoyed on Percy's account than my own.  I happen to know something of Jeffreys before he came to Wildtree.  To tell you the truth, Mrs Rimbolt, I don't think he is a safe companion for Percy at all.\"  \"I have long felt the same; but what is to be done, Mr Scarfe?  Mr Rimbolt has almost the same craze as Percy for this librarian of his, and I have really no voice in the matter.  He contrives to leave nothing definite to lay hold of; I should be thankful if he did.  But it is most uncomfortable to feel that one's own son is perhaps being ruined under this roof.\"  \"It must be.  It is no business of mine, of course, except that I am fond of Percy, and should be sorry to see harm come to him; and knowing what I do--\"  At that moment Mr Rimbolt, with Mrs Scarfe, entered the room.  \"What secrets are you two talking?\" said the latter.  \"Your son was just telling me how fond he is of Percy; and I am sure it will be a great loss to Percy when he is gone.  He has promised me to come to see us in town at Easter.\"  \"It is a satisfaction that you can leave with the assurance that Percy is virtually well again,\" said Mr Rimbolt.  \"Really, I do not know how we should have got on without Mr Jeffreys to nurse him.  I never knew such devotion.  He has never wanted for a thing all the time; and Jeffreys' influence is of the highest and manliest sort.  Percy will be able to reckon this illness among the blessings of his life.\"  Mr Rimbolt spoke feelingly and warmly.  Scarfe and Mrs Rimbolt exchanged glances; and the conversation shortly afterwards turned to the journey before the travellers.  Scarfe had come down to the drawing-room resolved, cost what it would, to settle scores with Jeffreys there and then by denouncing him to the family on whose favour he was dependent; and had Mr Rimbolt's entrance been delayed a few minutes, Mrs Rimbolt would have known all about young Forrester.  Once again, however, he was stopped in time, and a few moments' reflection convinced him it was as well.  Raby, he knew, whatever she might think of Jeffreys, would never forgive the informant who should be the means of turning him out of Wildtree, still less would Percy.  Nor was Mr Rimbolt likely to esteem his guest more highly in the capacity of tale-bearer; and he decidedly wished to \"keep in\" with all three.  And there was another reason still.  Scarfe was at the bottom of his heart not quite a villain, and much as he detested Jeffreys, and longed to be revenged--for what injury do certain minds feel half so much as that which one man commits in being better than another?--he had an uncomfortable suspicion in his mind that after all Jeffreys was not quite the miscreant he tried to imagine him.  That he was guilty in the matter of young Forrester there was no doubt; but much as he should have liked to believe it, he could not be quite sure that the accident at Bolsover was the result of a deliberate murderous design, or indeed of anything more than the accidental catastrophe of a blundering fit of temper--criminal, if you like, and cowardly, but not fiendish.  And his conscience made coward enough of him just now to cause him to hesitate before plunging into ruin one who, hateful as he was to him, was after all a poor wretch, miserable enough for any one.  Not having done what he intended to do, Scarfe felt decidedly virtuous, and considered himself entitled to any amount of credit for his forbearance!  It seemed a pity Raby should not know of this noble effort of self-denial.  \"Miss Atherton,\" said he, just as they were about to separate for the night, \"I'm afraid you will have forgotten all about me when you see me next.\"  \"You are very uncomplimentary, Mr Scarfe.\"  \"I do not mean to be; and I'm sure I shall not forget you.\"  \"Thank you.  This has been a very eventful visit.\"  \"It has; but I shall never regret that day on the ice, although I fear I made one enemy by what I did.\"  \"You don't understand Mr Jeffreys; he is very shy and proud.\"  \"I understand him quite well, and wish for Percy's sake every one here did too.  But I am not going to disobey you, and talk of people behind their backs, Miss Atherton.  I am sure you will approve of that.\"  \"I do; I never like it unless it is something nice of them.\"  \"Then I certainly had better not talk to you about Mr Jeffreys,\" said Scarfe with a sneer, which did him more damage in Raby's eyes than a torrent of abuse from his lips.  \"Do you know you have never yet shown me the telegram you had about your father's last battle?  It came the morning I was away, you know.\"  \"Yes.  I fancied perhaps you did not care to see it, as you never asked me,\" said Raby, producing the precious paper from her dress, where she kept it like a sort of talisman.  \"How could you think that?\" said Scarfe reproachfully, who had quite forgotten to ask to see it.  He took the paper and glanced down it.  \"Hullo!\" said he, starting as Jeffreys had done.  \"Captain Forrester!  I wonder if that's poor young Forrester's father?\"  \"Who is poor young Forrester?\" inquired Raby.  Scarfe read the paper to the end, and then looked up in well-simulated confusion.  \"Poor young Forrester?  Oh--well, I dare say Jeffreys could tell you about him.  The fact is, Miss Atherton, if I am not allowed to talk of people behind their backs it is impossible for me to tell you the story of poor young Forrester.\"  \"Then,\" said Raby, flushing, as she folded up the paper, \"I've no desire to hear it.\"  Scarfe could see he had gone too far.  \"I have offended you,\" said he, \"but really I came upon the name so unexpectedly that--\"  \"Do you expect to be working hard this term at Oxford?\" said Raby, doing the kindest thing in turning the conversation.  It was hardly to be wondered at if she retired that night considerably perplexed and disturbed.  There was some mystery attaching to Jeffreys, which, if she was to set any store by Scarfe's insinuations, was of a disgraceful kind.  And the agitation which both Scarfe and Jeffreys had shown on reading the telegram seemed to connect this Captain Forrester, or rather his son, whom Scarfe spoke of as \"poor young Forrester,\" with the same mystery.  Raby was a young lady with the usual allowance of feminine curiosity, which, though she was charity itself, did not like to be baulked by a mystery.  She therefore opened a letter she had just finished to her father, to add the following postscript:--  \"Was this brave Captain Forrester who saved the guns a friend of yours? Tell me all about him.  Had he a wife and children?  Surely something will be done for them, poor things.\"  Early next morning Mrs Scarfe and her son left Wildtree.  Jeffreys, from Percy's window, watched them drive away.  \"Very glad you must be to see the back of them,\" said Percy.  \"I am glad,\" responded Jeffreys honestly.  \"I'm not so frightfully sorry,\" said Percy.  \"Scarfe's a jolly enough chap, but he's up to too many dodges, don't you know?  And he's dead on Raby, too.  Quite as dead as you are, Jeff.\"  \"Percy, a fortnight's congestion has not cured you of the bad habit of talking nonsense,\" said Jeffreys.  \"All very well, you old humbug, but you know you are, aren't you?\"  \"Your cousin is very good and kind, and no one could help liking her. Everybody is `dead on her,' as you call it, even Walker.\"  Percy enjoyed this, and allowed himself to be led off the dangerous topic.  He was allowed to sit up for the first time this day, and held a small _levee_ in his room.  Jeffreys took the opportunity to escape for a short time to the library, which he had scarcely been in since the day on the mountain.  He knew Mrs Rimbolt would enjoy her visit to the sick-chamber better without him, and he decidedly preferred his beloved books to her majestic society.  Percy, however, was by no means satisfied with the arrangement.  \"Where's old Jeff?\" said he presently, when his mother, Raby, and he were left alone.  \"Raby, go and tell Jeff, there's a brick.  You can bet he's in the library.  Tell him if he means to cut me dead, he might break it gently.\"  \"Raby,\" said Mrs Rimbolt, as her niece, with a smile, started on his majesty's errand, \"I do not choose for you to go looking about for Mr Jeffreys.  There is a bell in the room, and Walker can do it if required.  It is unseemly in a young lady.\"  \"One would think old Jeff was a wild beast or a nigger by the way you talk,\" said Percy complainingly.  \"All I know is, if it hadn't been for him, you'd all have been in deep mourning now, instead of having tea up here with me.\"  \"It is quite possible, Percy,\" said his mother, \"for a person--\"  \"Person!\" interrupted the boy.  \"Jeff's not a person; he's a gentleman. As good as any of us, only he hasn't got so much money.\"  \"I fear, Percy, your illness has not improved your good manners.  I wish to say that Mr Jeffreys may have done you service--\"  \"I should think he has,\" interrupted the irrepressible one.  \"But it by no means follows that he is a proper companion for a good innocent boy like you.\"  Percy laughed hilariously.  \"Really, ma, you are coming it strong.  Do you see my blushes, Raby?\"  \"You must make up your mind to see a great deal less of Mr Jeffreys for the future; he is not the sort of person--\"  \"Look here, ma,\" said Percy, terrifying his parent by the energy with which he sprang to his feet.  \"I'm jolly ill, and you'd be awfully sorry if I had a fit of coughing and brought up blood, wouldn't you?  Well, I shall if you call Jeff a person again.  Where _is_ Jeff, I say?  I want Jeff.  Why don't you tell him, Raby?\"  After this, for a season at any rate, Percy was allowed to have his own way, and jeopardised his moral welfare by unrestricted intercourse with the \"person\" Jeffreys.  They spent their time not wholly unprofitably.  For, besides a good deal of reading of history and classics (for which Percy was rapidly developing a considerable taste), and a good deal of discussion on all sorts of topics, they were deep in constructing the model of a new kind of bookcase, designed by Percy, with some ingenious contrivances for keeping out dust and for marking, by means of automatic signals, the place of any book which should be taken from its shelf.  This wonderful work of art promised to eclipse every bookcase ever invented.  The only drawback to it was that it was too good.  Percy insisted on introducing into it every \"dodge\" of which he was capable, and the poor model more than once threatened to collapse under the burden of its own ingenuity. However, they stuck to it, and by dint of sacrificing a \"dodge\" here and a \"dodge\" there, they succeeded in producing a highly curious and not unworthy model, which Percy was most urgent that his father should forthwith adopt for his library, all the existing bookcases being sacrificed for firewood to make way for the new ones.  Mr Rimbolt diplomatically promised to give the matter his consideration, and consult authorities on the subject when next in London, and meanwhile was not unsparing in his compliments to the inventor and his coadjutor.  So the time passed happily enough for Jeffreys, until about three weeks after the Scarfes' departure, when the following amiable letter reached him with the Oxford post-mark on the envelope:--  Christ Church, _February 20th_.  \"Jeffreys,--You may have supposed that because I left Wildtree without showing you up in your proper character as a murderer and a hypocrite, that I have changed my opinions as to what is my duty to Mr Rimbolt and his family in this matter.  It is not necessary for me to explain to you why I did not do it at once, especially after the blackguardly manner in which you acted on the last evening of my stay there.  You being Mr Rimbolt's servant, I had to consider his convenience.  I now write to say that you can spare me the unpleasant duty of informing the Wildtree household of what a miscreant they have in their midst by doing it yourself.  If, after they know all, they choose to keep you on, there is nothing more to be said.  You are welcome to the chance you will have of lying in order to whitewash yourself, but either I or you must tell what we know.  Meanwhile I envy you the feelings with which I dare say you read of the death of poor young Forrester's father in Afghanistan.  How your cowardly crime must have brightened his last hours!  \"Yours,--  \"E.  Scarfe.\"  Jeffreys pitched this elegant specimen of polite Billingsgate contemptuously into the grate.  He was not much a man of the world, but he could read through the lines of a poor performance like this.  Scarfe, for some reason or other, did not like to tell the Rimbolts himself, but he was most anxious they should know, and desired Jeffreys to do the dirty work himself.  There was something almost amusing in the artlessness of the suggestion, and had the subject been less personally grievous, Jeffreys could have afforded to scoff at the whole business.  He sat down on the impulse of the moment and dashed off the following reply:--  \"Dear Scarfe,--Would it not be a pity that your sense of duty should not have the satisfaction of doing its own work, instead of begging me to do it for you?  I may be all you say, but I am not mean enough to rob you of so priceless a jewel as the good conscience of a man who has done his duty.  So I respectfully decline your invitation, and am,--  \"Yours,--  \"J.  Jeffreys.\"  Having relieved himself by writing it, he tore the note up, and tried to forget all about it.  But that was not quite so easy.  Scarfe's part in the drama he could not forget, but the question faced him, not for the first time.  Had he any right to be here, trusted, and by some of the family even respected? Was he not sailing under false colours, and pretending to be something he was not?  True, he had been originally engaged as a librarian, a post in which character was accounted of less importance than scholarship and general proficiency.  But he was more than a librarian now.  Circumstances had made him the mentor and companion of a high-spirited, honest boy.  Was it fair to Percy to keep a secret what would certainly shut the doors of Wildtree against him for ever?  Was it fair to Mr Rimbolt to accept this new responsibility without a word?  Was it fair to Raby, who would shrink from him with detestation, did she know the whole story?  Scarfe would have been amply satisfied had he been present to note the disquietude which ensued for some days after the arrival of his letter. Jeffreys felt uncomfortable in his intercourse with Mr Rimbolt; he avoided Raby, and even with Percy he was often unaccountably reserved and pensive.  \"What are you in the blues about?\" demanded that quick-sighted young gentleman on the first day out of doors after his illness.  \"Are you sorry I'm all serene again?\"  \"Rather,\" said Jeffreys; \"it's not been a bad time.\"  \"No more it has; but I must say I don't mind feeling my legs under me. I shall soon be ready for the top of Wild Pike again.  But, I say, aren't you well?  I expect you've been knocking yourself up over me?\"  \"Not a bit of it; I'm as well as anything.\"  Percy, however, was not satisfied.  He had a vague idea that young gentlemen in love were as a rule sickly, and by a simple process of reasoning he guessed that Jeffreys and Raby \"had had a row.\"  He therefore took an early opportunity of mentioning the matter to his cousin, greatly to that young lady's confusion.  \"Raby, I say, look here!\" he began, a day or two afterwards, as he and his cousin were walking together.  \"What makes you so jolly down on Jeff?\"  \"I down on Mr Jeffreys?  What do you mean?\"  \"Well, he's so dismal, I'm certain he's eating his heart out about you! Why don't you back him up?  He's a good enough chap and no end of a brick, and say what you will, he meant to fish you out that day on the ice.  He went off like a shot directly after the ice cracked.\"  \"Percy, you ridiculous boy!\" said Raby, biting her lips; \"how can you talk such nonsense?\"  \"Oh! but he did,\" persisted the boy.  \"I'm not talking about the ice,\" said she.  \"Mr Jeffreys and I are very good friends; chiefly on your account, too,\" added she, with a vague idea of qualifying her admission.  \"Oh, ah, that won't wash, you know,\" said Percy.  \"Anyhow, it's nonsense you being so precious stiff with him; I'm sure he's as good as Scarfe.\"  \"Percy, if you cannot talk sense,\" said Raby, nearly crying with vexation, \"I shall not listen to you.\"  \"Oh, all serene!\" responded Percy.  \"Of course you're bound to make out it's all humbug, but I know better.  Come, don't be in a rage, Raby; you forget I'm an invalid.\"  So they made it up on the spot, and Percy flattered himself he had done a great deal to make things right for Jeffreys.  Jeffreys, however, was still harassed by perplexity, and was gradually veering round to the conclusion that he must at all costs relieve his mind of his secret to Mr Rimbolt.  He put the task off day after day, shrinking from the wrench of all the ties which made his life happy.  One day, however, finding himself alone with Mr Rimbolt in the library, he suddenly resolved then and there to speak out.  \"Oh, Jeffreys,\" began Mr Rimbolt, \"I am very anxious to get those books from the Wanley Abbey sale looked through and catalogued within the next few days if you can manage it.  We all go up to London, you know, next week, and I should be glad to have all square before we start.\"  \"I have no doubt they can all be gone through before then.\"  \"I should like you to come to town, too,\" said Mr Rimbolt.  \"Percy sets great store by your companionship; besides which, there are some very important book sales coming on in which I shall want your help.\"  \"I had been going to ask you--\" began Jeffreys, feeling his temples throbbing like two steam-engines.  \"Oh, by the way,\" interrupted Mr Rimbolt, taking a letter from his pocket, \"did not you tell me you were at a school called Bolsover?\"  \"Yes,\" faltered Jeffreys, wondering what was coming.  \"It's very odd.  I have a letter from an old Oxford acquaintance of mine, called Frampton, who appears to be head-master there, and whom I have never heard of for about sixteen years.  He is fond of books, and writes to ask if he may come and see the library.  I've asked him to stay a night, and expect him here to-morrow.  I dare say you will be glad to meet him.  Perhaps he knows you are here?\"  \"No, I don't think so,\" said Jeffreys.  \"Ah, then I dare say you will be glad to see one another again.\"  Jeffreys was considerably staggered by this unexpected announcement, but it relieved him of all present perplexity as to speaking to Mr Rimbolt of young Forrester.  He would at least wait till Mr Frampton came, and put himself in his hands.  Mr Frampton came, as young and fresh as ever.  He was taking a three days' run in the Lake country during a term holiday, and, determined to do and see all he could, had decided to visit his old college friend, and look over the now famous Wildtree library.  His surprise at meeting Jeffreys was very considerable; and at first it seemed to the quondam pupil that his old master was shy of him.  This, however, was explained as soon as they were alone, and had to do with the seven pounds, which had burned holes in Mr Frampton's pockets ever since he received them, but which, not knowing Jeffreys' address, he had never been able to return.  \"I was never more pained than when I received this money,\" said he. \"Your guardian was written to by the clerk in ordinary course, but I never imagined the bill would be passed on to you.\"  Jeffreys had nothing for it but to take the money back, much as he disliked it.  Until he did so, Mr Frampton was too fidgety to be approachable on any other subject.  The morning after his arrival, they went up Wild Pike together--the first time Jeffreys had been on the mountain since the death of Julius. They had a fine day and no difficulty; but the long talk which beguiled the way amply made up to Jeffreys for the lack of adventure.  Mr Frampton told him much about Bolsover, and of how it was at last beginning to thrive and recover from the dry-rot; how this winter the football team had got up a name for itself; how the school discussion society was crowded with members; how the cricket prospects were decidedly hopeful; and how two fellows had lately gained scholarships at Oxford.  Then he began to ask Jeffreys about himself, and got from him a full account of all that had befallen him since he left school.  Mr Frampton was a most sympathetic listener, and the poor \"dog with a bad name,\" who had almost forgotten the art of speaking his mind fully to any one, warmed insensibly to this friend as they talked, and reproached himself for the pride and shortsightedness which had induced him to shut himself out so long from his friendship.  Then they talked of young Forrester.  Mr Frampton made no attempt to gloss over the wickedness of that unhappy act of passion.  But he showed how fully he made allowances for the poor blundering offender, and how he, at least, saw more to pity than to upbraid in it all.  He knew nothing of young Forrester's fate.  He had seen in the papers the notice of Captain Forrester's death, from whom, months before, he had had a letter of inquiry as to his son's whereabouts, and to whom he had written telling all he knew, which was but little.  Then Jeffreys unfolded his present uncomfortable dilemma, and his intention of speaking to Mr Rimbolt, and they talked it over very seriously and anxiously.  At last Mr Frampton said,--  \"Let me speak to Mr Rimbolt.\"  \"Most thankfully I will.\"  So Mr Frampton spoke to Mr Rimbolt, and told him frankly all there was to tell, and Mr Rimbolt, like a gentleman who knew something of Christian charity, joined his informant in pitying the offender.  \"Jeffreys,\" said he, the day after Mr Frampton's departure, \"your friend has told me a story about you which I heard with great sorrow. You are now doing all that an honest man can do, with God's help, to make up for what is past.  What I have been told does not shake my present confidence in you in any way, and I need not tell you that not a single person in this house beyond yourself and me shall know anything about this unhappy affair.\"    CHAPTER TWENTY ONE.  \"GOING IT.\"  Jeffreys started for London with a lighter heart than he had known since he first came to Wildtree.  When he contrasted his present sense of relief with the oppression which had preceded it, he marvelled how he could ever have gone on so long, dishonestly nursing his wretched secret under Mr Rimbolt's roof.  Now, in the first reaction of relief, he was tempted to believe his good name was really come back, and that Mr Rimbolt having condoned his offence, the memory of Bolsover was cancelled.  It was a passing temptation only.  Alas! that memory clung still. Nothing could alter the past; and though he might now feel secure from its consequences, he had only to think of young Forrester to remind him that somewhere the black mark stood against his name as cruelly as ever.  Yet, comparatively, he felt light-hearted, as with the Rimbolt family he stood at last on the London platform.  It was new ground to him.  Some years ago Mr Halgrove had lived several months in the Metropolis, and the boy, spending his summer holidays there, and left entirely to his own devices, had learned in a plodding way about as much of the great city as a youth of seventeen could well do in the time.  The Rimbolts' house in Clarges Street was to Jeffreys' mind not nearly so cheerful as Wildtree.  The library in it consisted of a small collection of books, chiefly political, for Mr Rimbolt's use in his parliamentary work; and the dark little room allotted to him, with its look-out on the mews, was dull indeed compared with the chamber at Wildtree, from which he could at least see the mountain.  Nor did he by any means enjoy the constant round of entertainments which went on in London, at which he was sometimes called upon in a humble way to assist.  He had been obliged, in deference to Mrs Rimbolt's broad hints, to buy a dress suit, and in this he was expected on occasions to present himself at the end of a grand dinner-party, or when Mr Rimbolt required his professional attendance.  For, there being no books to take care of here, Mr Rimbolt availed himself of his librarian's services as a private secretary in some important political business, and found him so efficient and willing, that he proposed to him a considerable increase in his salary, in consideration of his permanently undertaking a good share of his employer's ordinary correspondence.  The chief portion of Jeffreys' time, however, still belonged to Percy, and it was a decided relief to him that that young gentleman scoffed at and eschewed the endless hospitalities and entertainments with which his mother delighted to fill up their life in London.  \"I don't see the fun of gorging night after night, do you, Jeff?  A good spread's all very well now and again, but you get sick of it seven nights a week.  Makes me sleepy.  Then all these shows and things!  I've a good mind to get laid up again, and have a real good time.  There's to be no end of a crowd here to-night--everybody.  I shall cut it if I can; shan't you?\"  \"Mr Rimbolt wants me to come into the drawing-room after dinner,\" said Jeffreys.  \"All serene!  That won't be till nine.  Come up to Putney, and have a row on the river this afternoon.\"  Percy was an enthusiastic oarsman, and many an afternoon Jeffreys and he, flying from the crowd, had spent on the grand old Thames.  Jeffreys enjoyed it as much as he, and no one, seeing the boy and his tutor together in their pair-oar, would have imagined that the broader of the two was that ungainly lout who had once been an object of derision in the Bolsover meadows.  The party that evening was, as Percy predicted, a very large one, and Jeffreys had the discomfort of recognising a few of the guests who last autumn had helped to make his position so painful.  They, to do them justice, did not now add to his discomfort by recognising him.  Even the lady who had given him that half-crown appeared wholly to have forgotten the object of her charity.  What, however, made him most uncomfortable was the sight of Mrs Scarfe, and hearing her say to Percy, \"Edward is coming on Saturday, Percy; he is looking forward with such pleasure to taking you about to see the University sports and the Boat Race.  Your dear mamma has kindly asked two of his college friends to come too, so you will be quite a merry quartette.\"  Jeffreys had nearly forgotten Scarfe's existence of late.  He no longer dreaded him on his own account, but on Percy's he looked forward to Saturday with dismay.  He would have liked to know also, as a mere matter of curiosity of course, what Raby thought about the promised visit.  His own communications with that young lady had not been very frequent of late, although they continued friendly.  Percy's nonsense gave them both a considerable amount of embarrassment; for although Jeffreys never for a moment supposed that Mr Rimbolt's niece thought twice about him except as a persecuted dependant and a friend to Percy, to have anything else suggested disturbed his shy nature, and made him feel constrained in her presence.  \"You'll have to mind your eye with Raby now that Scarfe's coming,\" said Percy that night.  \"You bet he'll try to hook her.  I heard his mother flying kites with ma about it, to see how the land lies.\"  Jeffreys had given up the formality of pretending, when Percy launched out on this delicate subject, not to know what he was talking about.  \"Whatever Scarfe does,\" said he, \"is nothing to me.\"  \"What I don't you and Raby hit it off, then?\"  \"Hit what off?\"  \"I mean aren't you dead on her, don't you know?--spoons, and all that sort of thing?\"  \"I am not aware that I entertain feelings towards anybody which could be described by any article of cutlery at all.\"  \"Well, all I can say is, when I blowed her up for being down on you, she blushed up no end, and cried too.  I should like to know what you call that, if it isn't spoons?\"  \"I think it would be kinder, Percy, if you did not talk to your cousin about me; and I fancy she would as soon you did not talk about her to me.\"  \"Well, that's rather what I should call a shut-up,\" said Percy.  \"It bothers me how people that like one another get so precious shy of letting the other fellow know it.  I know I shan't.  I'll have it out at once, before any other chap comes and cuts me out.\"  With which valiant determination Percy earned Jeffreys' gratitude by relapsing into silence.  He was, however, destined to have the uncomfortable topic revived in another and more unexpected quarter.  On the day before Scarfe's proposed visit, Walker accosted him as he was going out, with the announcement that my lady would like to speak to him in the morning-room.  This rare summons never failed to wring a groan from the depths of the librarian's spirit, and it did now as he proceeded to the torture- chamber.  The lady was alone, and evidently burdened with the importance of the occasion.  \"Mr Jeffreys,\" said she, with a tone of half conciliation which put up Jeffreys' back far more than her usual severe drawl, \"kindly take a seat; I wish to speak to you.\"  \"It's all up with me!\" groaned the unhappy Jeffreys inwardly, as he obeyed.  Mrs Rimbolt gathered herself together, and began.  \"I desire to speak to you, Mr Jeffreys, in reference to my niece, Miss Atherton, who, in her father's absence, is here under my protection and parental control.\"  Jeffreys flushed up ominously.  \"It does not please me, Mr Jeffreys, to find you, occupying, as you do, the position of a dependant in this house, so far forgetting yourself as to consider that there is anything in your respective positions which justifies you in having communications with Miss Atherton other than those of a respectful stranger.\"  Jeffreys found himself frivolously thinking this elaborate sentence would be an interesting exercise in parsing for the head class at Galloway House.  He barely took in that the remarks were intended for him at all, and his abstracted look apparently disconcerted Mrs Rimbolt.  \"I must request your attention, Mr Jeffreys,\" said she severely.  \"I beg your pardon.  I am all attention.\"  \"I am quite willing to suppose,\" continued she, \"that it is ignorance on your part rather than intentional misconduct which has led you into this; but from henceforth I wish it to be clearly understood that I shall expect you to remember your proper station in this house.  Miss Atherton, let me tell you, has no need of your attentions.  You perfectly understand me, Mr Jeffreys?\"  Jeffreys bowed, still rather abstractedly.  \"You do not reply to my question, Mr Jeffreys.\"  \"I perfectly understand you, madam.\"  \"I trust I shall not have to speak to you again.\"  \"I trust not,\" said Jeffreys, with a fervour which startled the lady.  He left the room, outraged, insulted, sorely tempted to shake the dust of the place once and for all from off his feet.  The evil temper within him once more asserted itself as he flung himself into his room, slamming the door behind him with a force that made the whole house vibrate.  The narrow room was insupportable.  It stifled him.  He must get out into the fresh air or choke.  On the doorstep he met Mr Rimbolt, alighting from his brougham.  \"Oh, Jeffreys, so glad to have caught you.  Look here.  I find I must be in the House to-night and to-morrow, and I intended to go down to Exeter to attend that four days' sale of Lord Waterfield's library.  I must get you to go for me.  You have the catalogue we went through together, with the lots marked which I must have.  I have put an outside price against some, and the others must be mine at any price--you understand.  Stick at nothing.  Take plenty of money with you for travelling and expenses. Do things comfortably, and I will give you a blank cheque for the books. Mind I must have them, if it comes to four figures.  Go down by the Flying Dutchman to-night, and send me a telegram at the end of each day to say what you have secured.\"  The proposal came opportunely to Jeffreys.  He was in the humour of accepting anything for a change; and this _carte blanche_ proposal, and the responsibility it involved, contained a spice of excitement which suited with his present mood.  He went down to Exeter that night, trying to think of nothing but Lord Waterfield's books, and to forget all about Raby, and Percy, and Mrs Rimbolt, and Scarfe.  The last-named hero and his two friends duly presented themselves at Clarges Street next day.  Scarfe was in great good-humour with himself, and even his antipathies to the world at large were decidedly modified by the discovery that Jeffreys was out of town.  His two friends were of the gay and festive order--youths who would have liked to be considered fast, but betrayed constantly that they did not yet know the way how.  Percy, with his usual facile disposition, quickly fell into the ways of the trio, and rather enjoyed the luxury of now and then getting a rise out of the undergrads by showing that \"he knew a thing or two\" himself.  They spent their first few days together in \"going it\"--that is, in seeing and doing all they could.  Scarfe's friends began shyly, feeling their way both with their host and hostess and with their son.  But then they saw that Mr Rimbolt was far too engrossed to think of anything beyond that they should all enjoy themselves and do as they liked--when they saw that Mrs Rimbolt swore by Scarfe, and, to use the choice language of one of them, \"didn't sit up at anything as long as the Necktie was in it\"--and when they saw that Percy was a cool hand, and, whatever he thought, did not let himself be startled by anything, these two ingenuous youths plucked up heart and \"let out all round.\"  They haunted billiard saloons, but failed to delude any one into the belief that they knew one end of a cue from another.  They went to theatres, where the last thing they looked at was the stage.  They played cards without being quite sure what was the name of the game they played.  They smoked cigars, which it was well for their juvenile stomachs were \"warranted extra mild\"; and they drank wine which neither made glad their hearts nor improved their digestions; and they spiced their conversation with big words which they did not know the meaning of themselves, and would certainly have never found explained in the dictionary.  Percy, after a few days, got sick of it.  He had never \"gone it\" in this style before; and finding out what it meant, he didn't see much fun in it.  Late hours and unwholesome food and never-ending \"sport\" did not agree with him.  He had looked forward to seeing a lot of the boat practice on the river, and hearing a lot about University sport and life.  But in this he was disappointed.  The \"boats\" were voted a nuisance; and whenever the talk turned on Oxford it was instantly tabooed as \"shop.\"  Scarfe sneered to him in private about these two fools, but when with them he \"went it\" with the rest, and made no protest.  \"Percy,\" said Raby, two or three days after this sort of thing had been going on, \"you look wretchedly pale and tired.  Why do you stay out so late every night?\"  \"Oh,\" said Percy wearily, \"I don't know--we humbug about.  Nothing very bad.\"  \"If it makes you ill and wretched, I say it is bad, Percy,\" said the girl.  \"Oh, I don't know.  Scarfe goes in for it, you know.\"  \"I don't care a bit who goes in for it.  It's bad.\"  \"You don't mean to say you think Scarfe is a bad lot?\"  \"Don't speak to me of Mr Scarfe.  I hate him for this!\"  Percy whistled.  \"Hullo, I say! here's a go!\" he cried.  \"Then you're really spoons on Jeff after all?  How awfully glad he'll be when I tell him!\"  \"Percy I shall hate _you_ if you talk like that!\" said the girl.  \"I hate any one who is not good to you; and it is certainly not good to you to lead you into folly and perhaps wickedness.\"  This protest had its effect on Percy.  The next day he struck, and pleaded an excuse for accompanying the precious trio on an expedition to Windsor, to be consummated by a champagne supper at the \"Christopher.\"  They urged him hard, and tempted him sorely by the prospect of a row on the river and any amount of fun.  He declined stubbornly.  He was fagged, and not in the humour.  Awfully sorry to back out and all that, but he couldn't help it, and wanted to save up for the Sports and Boat Race on Friday and Saturday.  They gave him up as a bad job, and started without him.  He watched them go without much regret, and then, putting on his hat, walked off towards Paddington to meet Jeffreys, who was due in about an hour.  The quiet walk through the streets rather revived him; and the prospect of seeing Jeffreys again was still more refreshing.  Of course he knew he should have to tell him of his folly, and Jeff would \"sit on him\" in his solemn style.  Still, that was better than getting his head split open with cigars, and having to laugh at a lot of trashy jokes.  Jeffreys was delighted to see him; and the two were leaving Paddington arm-in-arm when Scarfe and his two friends, alighting from a cab, suddenly confronted them.    CHAPTER TWENTY TWO.  THE BAD NAME.  Percy was riotously greeted by Scarfe's two friends.  \"Hullo, old man!\" cried one of them; \"then you thought better of it, after all, and mean to join us!  That's the style!\"  \"Bring your handsome friend with you.  More the merrier.  There'll be champagne enough for the lot.\"  \"Look alive,\" said Percy; \"you'll lose your train.  Jeff and I aren't coming.\"  \"Why not?\" said they.  \"Because we're going the other way,\" replied Percy, who, when his mind was made up, did not appreciate anybody's importunity.  \"I've not seen Jeff for a week.\"  \"Who is this precious Jeff?\" said one of Scarfe's friends, pointing over his shoulder to the librarian.  \"He's a gentleman employed by the month to look after Percy's morals,\" said Scarfe, with a sneer.  \"A parson!  What a game!  No wonder Percy draws in his horns a bit when he comes home.  Anyhow, we must save him from the paws of the lion if we can.  I say, Percy, you must come, old man.  We made all the arrangements for four, boat and everything; and if you don't want to stay late we'll give up the supper.  Only don't spoil our day, there's a good fellow.  You'll be able to see lots of your friend when we've gone.\"  \"You be hanged,\" observed Percy, now in an uncomplimentary mood; \"haven't I told you I'm not coming?  What more do you want?\"  \"Oh, of course, if you're so taken up with this reverend thing of beauty,\" said one of them sulkily, \"we're out of it.  I should have thought he could have snuffled to himself for a day without wanting you to help him.\"  Scarfe all this time stood by in a rage.  The sight of Jeffreys was to him like the dead fly in the apothecary's ointment.  It upset him and irritated him with everybody and everything.  He had guessed, on receiving no reply to his recent polite letter, that he had exposed his own poor hand to his enemy, and he hated him accordingly with a double hatred.  He contrived, however, to keep up an appearance of scornful indifference.  \"You are still reaping the rewards of virtue, pious homicide,\" he sneered.  \"I still envy the upright man who does his duty,\" replied Jeffreys, scarcely less bitterly.  \"What do you mean, you--\"  \"I mean what I say,\" said Jeffreys, turning on his heel, and taking Percy's arm.  They walked home, and before Clarges Street was reached Percy had told his friend an unvarnished story of the follies of the last few days, and enlisted his support in his determination to pull up.  There was something touching in the mingled shame and anger of the proud boy as he made his confession, not sparing himself, and full of scorn at those who had tempted him.  Jeffreys was full of righteous wrath on his behalf, and ran up a score against Scarfe which would have astonished that worthy, listlessly loafing about at Windsor, had he guessed it.  \"I've promised to go and see the Boat Race with them,\" said Percy; \"but you must come too.  I know you'll hate it, and so will they; but somehow I can't do without a little backing up.\"  \"I'll back you up, old fellow, all I can, I only wish,\" added he, for the boy's confidence in him humiliated him, \"I had a better right to do it.\"  \"Why, Jeff, I don't suppose you ever did a bad thing in your life.\"  \"Don't say that,\" said Jeffreys almost appealingly, \"I have!\"  The boy looked up at him, startled for a moment by his tone.  Then he said, with a return of his old look of confidence--  \"Poor old Jeff!  That's what makes you so blue sometimes.  If it weren't for you, I'd have a precious good right to be in the blues too.\"  Jeffreys, who had not entered the house since his interview with Mrs Rimbolt, felt anything but comfortable as he again set foot within it; and had it not been for Percy's countenance, he would have felt it still more of an ordeal.  He had, however, plenty to occupy his mind during the hour or two which followed.  Mr Rimbolt was waiting for him eagerly, to hear all about the sale and the purchases which had been made.  \"You've done a capital stroke of business for me, Jeffreys,\" said he, when the report had been concluded.  \"Those three Caxtons I would not have missed for anything.  I am quite glad that business will take me North next week, as I shall be able to run over to Wildtree and see some of the treasures unpacked.  I shall, however, leave them for you finally to arrange when we all go back in June.  You've seen Percy?  I fancy he has been racketing rather too much with these friends of his; but I imagine Scarfe would see he went into no mischief.  However, I am glad you have come back, for the boy's sake, as you understand him.  This summer I think you should take him a little run in Normandy or Switzerland.  It would do him good, and you, too, to knock about abroad for a week or two.  However, there's time enough to talk about that. And I dare say you will be glad now to get a little rest after your journey.\"  Jeffreys returned to his room very contentedly.  The confidence Mr Rimbolt reposed in him was soothing to his spirits, and went far to obliterate the memory of that hideous interview last week.  Percy was out when, after washing and changing his travelling garb, he came down to the morning-room, which he usually occupied during the afternoon.  To his surprise, and even consternation, Raby was there, writing.  She rose, brightly, almost radiantly, as he entered.  \"Oh, Mr Jeffreys, how glad I am to see you back!  Poor Percy has been in such want of you!  These Oxford friends of his, I am certain, have not been doing him any good.  Have you seen him?  I am so happy you have come back!\"  Jeffreys was not made of adamant, and a greeting like this, even though it was offered on some one else's behalf, was enough to drive Mrs Rimbolt completely out of his head.  \"I am very fortunate to be able to make you happy so easily,\" said he. \"Yes, I have seen Percy, and heard all his troubles.  How could any one help being grateful for a confidence like his?  You know, Miss Atherton, I would do anything for him.\"  \"I believe you,\" said she warmly.  \"You are good and unselfish.\"  \"Do you mind my saying,\" said Jeffreys, colouring, \"that it is an additional pleasure to do what I can for Percy if it makes you happy?\"  \"I don't mind your saying it if it is true.  It does make me happy.\"  And her face was the best witness to her sincerity.  Jeffreys was not the only person who saw that bright smile.  Mrs Rimbolt, entering the room at that moment, saw it too, and heard the words which it accompanied.  She glared round witheringly on Jeffreys.  \"So, Mr Jeffreys, _you_ are here.  What brings you here?\"  \"Mr Jeffreys--\" began Raby, feeling and looking very confused.  \"Silence, Raby, I asked Mr Jeffreys.\"  \"I came here not knowing the room was occupied.  It was a pleasant surprise to find Miss Atherton here, and she has been making me happy by talking to me about Percy.\"  \"Mr Jeffreys,\" said the lady, \"allow me to say I do not believe you.\"  \"Auntie!\" exclaimed Raby, firing up in a manner unusual to her; \"it is true.  Mr Jeffreys always tells the truth!\"  \"Raby, my dear, you had better leave the room.\"  \"No, auntie!\" exclaimed the girl.  \"You have no right to charge Mr Jeffreys with saying what is not true.  It's not fair--it's wrong--it's wicked!\"  \"You forget, my dear, of all persons you should not address me like this.\"  \"No,\" said the girl, going to the door, which Jeffreys opened for her. \"I don't forget, and I shall not forget.  You have no right to say it. I wish father was home again, and would take me away!\"  In the midst of his own indignation, Jeffreys could not help admiring this outbreak of righteous indignation on the part of the spirited girl.  Mrs Rimbolt little guessed how much she herself was doing to defeat her own ends.  \"Mr Jeffreys,\" said she, after Raby had gone, \"after our interview last week, your conduct is both disgraceful and dishonourable.  I should not have believed it even of you.\"  \"Pardon me, madam.  You have charged me with telling you a lie just now. Is that so?\"  His tone was strangely peremptory.  Mrs Rimbolt had never seen him like this before--and for the moment it disconcerted her.  \"What I heard as I entered the room had no reference to Percy,\" said she.  \"Excuse me--it had.  Miss Atherton--\"  \"If it had, I must believe you.  I wish to hear no more about it.  But after your promise last week--\"  \"I made no promise, and should decline to do so.  I am quite aware of my position here, and am ready to give it up when called upon.  But while I stay here and do my work, Mrs Rimbolt, I claim to be protected from insult.\"  \"It is useless to prolong this interview, Mr Jeffreys,\" said Mrs Rimbolt, half-scared by the turn things had taken.  \"I never expected to be addressed in this way in my own house by one who is dependent on my husband for his living.  You can leave me, sir.\"  Jeffreys bowed, and retired to his room, where he awaited as calmly as he could what appeared to him the inevitable end of the scene--a notice to quit.  But it did not come.  Mrs Rimbolt knew herself to be in the wrong.  Her husband, she knew, if she laid the case before him, would judicially inquire into its merits, and come to the same conclusion.  In that case her dominion would be at an end.  Even the Mrs Rimbolts have an eye to the better half of valour sometimes, and so Jeffreys was left sitting for an ultimatum which did not come.  Raby had a still worse ordeal before her.  At first her indignation had reigned supreme and effaced all other emotions.  Gradually, however, a feeling of vague misery ensued.  She longed to be away in India with her dear soldier father; she wished Jeffreys had never come under the Wildtree roof to bring insult on himself and wretchedness to her.  She dreaded the future for her boy cousin without his protector, and half wished him dead and safe from temptation.  In due time her brave spirit came back.  She despised herself for her weakness, and, resolved boldly to face her aunt and every one, she came down to dinner.  It was strictly a family party, with Mrs Scarfe added; for the other three visitors had not yet returned from Windsor.  Raby sought protection from her aunt by devoting herself to Mrs Scarfe, and quite delighted that good lady by her brightness and spirit.  Mrs Scarfe took occasion in the drawing-room afterwards to go into rhapsodies to her young friend regarding her son; and when about ten o'clock the holiday- makers arrived home, in high spirits and full of their day's sport, she achieved a grand stroke of generalship by leaving the two young people together in the conservatory, having previously, by a significant pressure of her son's arm, given him to understand that now was his time for striking while the iron was hot.  Scarfe was in an unusually gay mood, and still a little elevated by the festivities of the day.  \"I'm sure you missed us,\" said he, \"didn't you?\"  \"The house was certainly much quieter,\" said Raby.  \"Do you know,\" said he, \"it's rather pleasant to feel that one is missed?\"  Raby said nothing, but began to feel a desire to be safely back in the drawing-room.  \"Do you know we drank toasts to-day, like the old knights, to our lady loves?\" continued Scarfe.  \"Indeed,\" replied Raby, as unconcernedly as she could.  \"Yes--and shall I tell you the name I pledged?  Ah, I see you know, Raby.\"  \"Mr Scarfe, I want to go back to the drawing-room; please take me.\"  Scarfe took her hand.  His head was swimming, partly with excitement, partly with the effects of the supper.  \"Not till I tell you I love you, and--\"  \"Mr Scarfe, I don't want to hear all this,\" said Raby, snatching her hand away angrily, and moving to the door.  He seized it again rudely.  \"You mean you don't care for me?\" asked he.  \"I want to go away,\" said she.  \"Tell me first,\" said he, detaining her; \"do you mean you will not have me--that you don't love me?\"  \"I don't,\" said she.  \"Then,\" said he, sober enough now, and standing between her and the door, \"there is another question still Is the reason because some one else in this house has--\"  \"Mr Scarfe,\" said Raby quietly, \"don't you think, when I ask you to let me go, it is not quite polite of you to prevent me?\"  \"Please excuse me,\" he said apologetically.  \"I was excited, and forgot; but, Raby, do let me warn you, for your sake, to beware of this fellow Jeffreys.  No, let me speak,\" said he, as she put up her hand to stop him.  \"I will say nothing to offend you.  You say you do not care for me, and I have nothing to gain by telling you this.  If he has--\"  \"Mr Scarfe, you are quite mistaken; do, please, let me go.\"  Scarfe yielded, bitterly mortified and perplexed.  His vanity had all along only supposed one possible obstacle to his success with Raby, and that was a rival.  That she would decline to have him for any other reason had been quite beyond his calculations, and he would not believe it now.  Jeffreys may not have actually gone as far as to propose to her, but, so it seemed, there was some understanding between them which barred Scarfe's own chance.  The worst of it all was that to do the one thing he would have liked to do would be to spoil his own chance altogether. For Raby, whether she cared for Jeffreys or not, would have nothing to say to Scarfe if he was the means of his ruin.  The air during the next few days seemed charged with thunder.  Mrs Rimbolt was in a state of war with every one, Mrs Scarfe was poorly, the two Oxford visitors began to vote their visit slow, Scarfe was moody, Raby was unhappy, Jeffreys felt continually half-choked, Percy alone kept up his spirits, while Mr Rimbolt, happiest of all, went up North to look at his old books.  No one was particularly sorry when the visits came to an end.  Even the Sports and Boat Race had failed to revive the drooping spirits of the Oxonians, and on the Monday following it was with a considerable stretch of politeness that they all thanked Mrs Rimbolt for a very pleasant visit.  Scarfe, taking farewell of Raby, begged that some time, later on, he might come to see her again, but was quite unable to gather from her reply whether she desired it or not.  Jeffreys wisely kept out of the way while the departures were taking place, despite Mrs Rimbolt's suggestion that he should be sent for to help the cabman carry out the boxes.  The first evening after they were all gone the house seemed another place.  Even Jeffreys felt he could breathe, despite Mr Rimbolt's absence, and the hostile proximity of his lady.  As to Raby and Percy, they made no concealment of the relief they felt, and went off for a row on the river to celebrate the occasion.  Jeffreys judiciously excused himself from accompanying them, and went a long walk by himself.  Two days later, after lunch, just as Percy and Raby had departed for a ride in the park, and Jeffreys had shut himself up in Mr Rimbolt's study to write, a letter was delivered by the post addressed to Mrs Rimbolt, bearing the Oxford post-mark.  It was from Scarfe, and Mrs Rimbolt opened her eyes as she perused it:--  \"Christchurch, _April_ 2.\"  Dear Mrs Rimbolt,--I reached here from home this morning, and hasten to send you a line to thank you for the very pleasant visit I spent in London last week.  I should have written sooner, but that I was anxious to write you on another and less pleasant subject, which I felt should not be done hurriedly.  You will, I dare say, blame me for not having told you earlier what I now feel it my duty to tell, and I trust you will understand the feelings which have prevented my doing so.  John Jeffreys, who is in Mr Rimbolt's employment, is, as you know, an old schoolfellow of mine.  I was surprised to see him at Wildtree last Christmas, and took the trouble to inquire whether he had come to you with a character, or whether you had any knowledge of his antecedents. I imagined you had not, and supposed that, as he was only engaged as a librarian, inquiries as to his character were not considered necessary. But when I saw that he was being admitted as a member of your household, and specially allowed to exercise an influence on Percy, I assure you I felt uncomfortable, and it has been on my mind ever since to tell you what I feel you ought to know.  Jeffreys ran away from school after committing a cruel act which, to all intents and purposes, was murder. His victim was a small boy whom we all loved, and who never did him harm.  The details of the whole affair are too horrible to dwell upon here, but I have said enough to show you what sort of person it is who is at present entrusted with the care of your own son, and allowed to associate on a footing of equality with your niece, Miss Atherton.  I can assure you it is very painful to me to write this, for I know how it will shock you.  But I feel my conscience would not give me peace till I told you all.  May I now ask one special favour from you?  It is well known, and you probably have noticed it yourself, that Jeffreys and I naturally dislike one another.  But I want you to believe that I write this, not because I dislike Jeffreys, but because I like you all, and feel that Percy particularly is in peril.  What I ask is that if you think it right to take any action in the matter, my name may not be mentioned.  It would be considered an act of spite on my part, which it is not; and perhaps I may mention to you that I have special reasons for wishing that Miss Atherton, at least, should not think worse of me than I deserve.  She would certainly misunderstand it if my name were mentioned.  I feel I have only done my duty, and I assure you it will be a great relief to me to know that you are rid of one who cannot fail to exercise a fatal influence on the pure and honest mind of my friend Percy.  \"Believe me, dear Mrs Rimbolt, most sincerely yours,--  \"E.  Scarfe.\"  The shock which this astounding communication gave to Mrs Rimbolt can be more easily imagined than described.  It explained everything--her instinctive dislike of the man from the first, his moroseness and insolence, and the cunning with which he had insinuated himself first into her husband's and then into Percy's confidence!  How blind she had been not to see it all before!  She might have known that he was a villain!  Now, however, her duty was clear, and she would be wicked if she delayed to act upon it a moment.  If Mr Rimbolt had been at home, it would have fallen on him to discharge it, but he was not, and she must do it for him.  Whereupon this worthy matron girded herself for the fray, and stalked off to the study.  Jeffreys was busy transcribing some bibliographical notes which he had brought away with him from Exeter.  The work was not very engrossing, and he had leisure now and then to let his mind wander, and the direction his thoughts took was towards Mr Rimbolt's little plan of a run on the Continent for Percy and himself this summer.  Jeffreys had been afraid to acknowledge to himself how much the plan delighted him. He longed to see the everlasting snows, and the lakes, and the grand old mediaeval cities, and the prospect of seeing them with Percy, away from all that could annoy or jar--  He had got so far when the door opened, and Mrs Rimbolt stood before him.  The lady was pale, and evidently agitated beyond her wont.  She stood for a moment facing Jeffreys, and apparently waiting for words.  The librarian's back went up in anticipation.  If it was more about Raby, he would leave the room before he forgot himself.  \"Mr Jeffreys,\" said the lady, and her words came slowly and hoarsely, \"I request you to leave this house in half an hour.\"  It was Jeffreys' turn to start and grow pale.  \"May I ask why?\" he said.  \"You know why, sir,\" said the lady.  \"You have known why ever since you had the meanness to enter Wildtree on false pretences.\"  \"Really, Mrs Rimbolt,\" began Jeffreys, with a cold shudder passing through him, \"I am at a loss--\"  \"Don't speak to me, sir!  You knew you had no right to enter the house of honest, respectable people--you knew you had no right to take advantage of an accident to insinuate yourself into this family, and impose upon the unsuspecting good-nature of my husband.  No one asked you for your character; for no one imagined you could be quite so hypocritical as you have been.  You, the self-constituted friend and protector of my precious boy--you, with the stain of blood on your hands and the mark of Cain on your forehead!  Leave my house at once; I desire no words.  You talked grandly about claiming to be protected from insult in this house.  It is we who claim to be protected from a hypocrite and a murderer!  Begone; and consider yourself fortunate that instead of walking out a free man, you are not taken out to the punishment you deserve!\"  When Jeffreys, stunned and stupefied, looked up, the room was empty.  Mechanically he finished a sentence he had been writing, then letting the pen drop from his hand, sat where he was, numbed body and soul. Mrs Rimbolt's words dinned in his ears, and with them came those old haunting sounds, the yells on the Bolsover meadows, the midnight shriek of the terrified boy, the cold sneer of his guardian, the brutal laugh of Jonah Trimble.  All came back in one confused hideous chorus, yelling to him that his bad name was alive still, dogging him down, down, mocking his foolish dreams of deliverance and hope, hounding him out into the night to hide his head indeed, but never to hide himself from himself.  How long he sat there he knew not.  When he rose he was at least calm and resolved.  He went up to his own room and looked through his little stock of possessions.  The old suit in which he had come to Wildtree was there; and an impulse seized him to put it on in exchange for the trim garments he was wearing.  Of his other goods and chattels he took a few special favourites.  His Homer--Julius's collar--a cricket cap--a pocket compass which Percy had given him, and an envelope which Raby had once directed to him for her uncle.  His money--his last quarter's salary--he took too, and his old stick which he had cut in the lanes near Ash Cottage. That was all.  Then quietly descending the deserted stairs, and looking neither to the right hand nor the left, he crossed the hall and opened the front door.  A pang shot through him as he did so.  Was he never to see Percy again, or _her_?  What would they think of him?  The thought maddened him; and as he stood in the street he seemed to hear their voices, too, in the awful clamour, and rushed blindly forth, anywhere, to escape it.    CHAPTER TWENTY THREE.  A PLUNGE DOWNWARD.  A chill October squall was whistling through the trees--in Regent's Park, stirring up the fallen leaves on the footpaths, and making the nursemaids, as they listlessly trundled their perambulators, shiver suddenly, and think of the nursery fire and the singing kettle on the hob.  The gathering clouds above sent the park-keeper off to his shed for a waterproof, and emptied the carriage-drive of the vehicles in which a few semi-grand people were taking an afternoon airing at half a crown an hour.  A little knot of small boys, intently playing football, with piled-up jackets for goals, and an old parti-coloured \"bouncer\" for a ball, were the last to take alarm at the lowering sky; nor was it till the big drops fell in their midst that they scattered right and left, and left the park empty.  No; not quite empty.  One young man sat on through the rain on the seat from which he had been watching the boys' game.  A shabby, almost ragged young man, with a disagreeable face and an almost contemptuous curl of the lips, as the rain, gathering force every second, buffeted him in the face and drenched him where he sat.  There were a hundred seats more sheltered than that on which he sat, and by walking scarcely fifty yards he could have escaped the rain altogether.  But he sat recklessly on, and let the rain do its worst, his eyes still on the empty football field, and his ears ringing still with the merry shouts of the departed boys.  My reader, had he chanced to pass down that deserted walk on this stormy afternoon, would hardly have recognised in the lonely occupant of that seat the John Jeffreys he had seen six months ago at Clarges Street.  It was not merely that he looked haggard and ill, or that his clothes were ragged.  That was bad enough, but the reader has seen him in such a plight before.  But what he has not seen before--or if at all, only in passing moments--is the bitter, hard look on his face, changing it miserably.  A stranger passing him that afternoon would have said--  \"There sits a man who hates all the world.\"  We, who know him better, would have said--  \"There sits our poor dog with a bad name, deserted even by hope.\"  And so it was.  Jeffreys had left Clarges Street smarting under a sense of injury, but still resolved to keep up the fight for his good name, in which for so many months past he had been engaged.  Not by appealing to Mr Rimbolt.  Although he knew, had Mr Rimbolt been at home, all this would not have happened, his pride forbade him now to take a single step to reinstate himself in a house from which he had been so ignominiously expelled.  No, not even when that house held within its walls Percy and Raby.  The idea of going back filled him with horror.  On the contrary, he would hide himself from them, even though they sought to find him; and not till his name was as good as theirs would he see them again or come near them.  Which surely was another way of resolving never to see them again; for the leopard cannot change his spots or the Ethiopian his skin!  A bad name is a stain which no washing can efface; it clings wherever you go, and often men who see it see nothing else in you but the scar.  So thought poor Jeffreys as he slowly turned his back on all that was dear to him in life, and went out into the night of the unsympathetic city.  At first, as I said, he tried to hold up his head.  He inquired in one or two quarters for work.  But the question always came up--  \"What is your character?\"  \"I have none,\" he would say doggedly.  \"Why did you leave your last place?\"  \"I was turned away.\"  \"What for?\"  \"Because I am supposed to have killed a boy once.\"  Once indeed he did get a temporary job at a warehouse--as a porter--and for a week, a happy week, used his broad back and brawny arms in carrying heavy loads and lifting weights.  Hope sprang again within him as he laboured.  He might yet, by beginning at the lowest step, rise above his evil name and conquer it.  Alas!  One day a shilling was lost from the warehouseman's desk. Jeffreys had been seen near the place and was suspected.  He resented the charge scornfully at first, then savagely, and in an outbreak of rage struck his accuser.  He was impeached before the head of the firm, and it was discovered that he had come without a character.  That was enough.  He was bundled out of the place at five minutes' notice, with a threat of a policeman if he made it six.  And even when a week later the shilling was found in the warehouseman's blotting-paper, no one doubted that the cashiered rogue was as cunning as he was nefarious.  After that he had given up what seemed the farce of holding up his head. What was the use, he said, when, as sure as night follows day, that bad name of his dogged him wherever he went?  So Jeffreys began to go down.  In after years he spoke very little of those six months in London, and when he did it was about people he had met, and not about himself.  What he did, where he lodged, how he lived, these were matters he never mentioned and never liked to be asked about.  I am quite sure myself that the reason of this silence was not shame. He was not one of those fellows who revenge themselves on fate by deliberately going to the bad.  At his worst, he had no taste for vice or any affinity for it.  He may have sunk low, not because he himself was low, but because in his miserable feud with all the world he scorned not to share the lot of others as miserable as himself.  His money--he had a few pounds when he left Clarges Street--soon failed him.  He made no great effort to keep it, and was relieved to see the end of it.  His companions in misery soon helped him away with it, and he let them.  But when it was gone the old necessity for work came back.  By day he hardly ever ventured out of his court, for fear of being seen by some one who would attempt to rescue him from his present condition.  At night he wandered restlessly about in the narrow streets picking up an early morning job at Covent Garden or in the omnibus stables.  He moved his lodgings incessantly, one week inhabiting a garret in Westminster, another sharing a common room in Whitechapel, another doing without lodgings altogether.  He spoke little or not at all to his fellow-miserables, not because he despised them, but because they fought shy of him.  They disliked his superior ways and his ill-concealed disgust of their habits and vices.  They could have forgiven him for being a criminal in hiding; that they were used to.  But a man who spoke like a gentleman, who took no pleasure in their low sports, and sat dumb while they talked loud and broad, seemed to them an interloper and an intruder.  Once--it was about the beginning of August--in a lodging-house across the river, he met a man to whom for a day or two he felt drawn.  His story was a sad one.  His father had been a gentleman, and the boy had been brought up in luxury and virtue.  While at school his father had died, and before he had left school his mother had been married again to a brute who not only broke her heart, but, after setting himself to corrupt his stepson, had at last turned him adrift without a penny in the world.  The lad, with no strong principle to uphold him, had sunk deep in vice.  Yet there lurked about him occasional flashes of something better.  \"After all,\" he would say to Jeffreys, as the two lay at night almost on bare boards, \"what's the odds?  I may be miserable one day, but I'm jolly the next.  Now you seem to prefer to be uniformly miserable.\"  \"Hardly a case of preference,\" said Jeffreys; \"but I'm not sure that it wouldn't be more miserable to be jolly.\"  \"Try it.  You'd give a lot to forget all about everything for an hour, wouldn't you?\"  \"It would be pleasant.\"  \"You can do it.\"  \"By dropping asleep?\"  \"Sleep!  That's the time I'm most miserable.  I remember the old days then, and my mother, and--I say, Jeffreys, I was once nearly drowned at Eton.  Just as I was going down for the last time I put up my hand, and a fellow saw it and came in and fished me out.  What a born fool I was to do it!  I was grateful to the fellow at the time.  I hate him now!\"  And the poor fellow, with all the manhood out of him, cried himself to sleep; and Jeffreys in mercy said not a word to stop him.  A pitiful sort of friendship sprung up between the two--the bitter strong one, and the vicious weak one.  It kept a soft corner in Jeffreys' heart to find some one who held to him even in this degradation, and to the poor prodigal it was worth anything to have some one to talk to.  Coming home one wet morning from one of his nocturnal expeditions, Jeffreys found his fellow-lodger up, with a bottle in his hands.  \"My boy, my boy,\" cried the lad, \"you're in luck, and just in time.  Who says I'm lost to all decency after this?  Why, I might have hidden it away when I heard you coming up.  No.  There's something of the nobleman left in me yet.  Half of this is yours, Jeffreys; only help yourself quickly, man, or I may repent.\"  He held out the bottle tremblingly and with a wince that spoke volumes.  \"Take it.  I never went halves before, and perhaps I never shall again.\"  Jeffreys took the bottle.  It was brandy.  \"Half a tumbler of that, Jeffreys, will make another man of you.  It will send you into dreamland.  You'll forget there is such a thing as misery in the world.  Don't be squeamish, old fellow.  You're cold and weak, you know you are; you ought to take it.  You're not too good, surely--eh?  Man alive, if you never do anything worse than take a drop of brandy, you'll pass muster.  Come, I say, you're keeping me waiting.\"  Jeffreys sunk on a chair, and raised the bottle half-way to his lips.  What was it, as he did so, which flashed before his eyes and caused him suddenly to set it down and rise to his feet?  Nothing real, it is true, yet nothing new.  Just a momentary glimpse of a boy's pale face somewhere in the dim gloom of that little room, and then all was as before.  Yet to Jeffreys the whole world was suddenly altered.  He set the bottle down, and neither heeding nor hearing the expostulations of his companion, he left the house never to return.  That night he slept in another part of the town; and the poor bewildered prodigal, deserted by his only friend, cried half the night through, and cursed again the Eton boy who had once saved his life.  Jeffreys, hidden in another part of the great city, sunk to a lower depth of misery than ever.  To him it seemed now that his bad name had taken form in the face of young Forrester, and was dogging him in adversity more relentlessly even than in prosperity.  It comforted him not at all to think it had saved him from a drunkard's ruin.  He despised himself, when he came to himself, for having been scared so weakly.  Yet he avoided his old quarters, and turned his back on the one friend he had, rather than face his evil genius again.  His evil genius!  Was he blinded then, that he saw in all this nothing but evil and despair?  Was he so numbed that he could not feel a Father's hand leading him even through the mist?  Had he forgotten that two little boys far away were praying for him?  Had he ceased to feel that young Forrester himself might be somewhere, not far away, ready to forgive?  He was blinded, and could see nothing through the mists.  He half envied his new fellow-lodgers in the den at Ratcliff.  Four of them, at least, stood a chance of being hanged.  Yet they managed to shake off care and live merrily.  \"Come, old gallus,\" said one young fellow, who in that place was the hero of a recent \"mystery\" in the West End, \"perk up.  You're safe enough here.  Don't be down.  We're all in the same boat.  Save up them long faces for eight o'clock in the morning at Old Bailey.  Don't spoil our fun.\"  It was half pathetic, this appeal; and Jeffreys for a day tried to be cheerful.  But he could not do it, and considerately went somewhere else.  How long was it to go on?  A time came when he could get no work, and starvation stared him in the face.  But a dying boy bequeathed him a loaf, and once again he was doomed to live.  But a loaf, and the proceeds of a week's odd jobs, came to an end.  And now once more, as he sits in the rain in Regent's Park, he faces something more than the weather.  He has not tasted food for two whole days, and for all he knows may never taste it again.  So he sits there, with his eyes still on that football ground, and his ears ringing still with the merry shouts of the departed boys.  The scene changes as he stays on.  It is a football field still, but not the brown patch in a London park.  There are high trees, throwing shadows across the green turf, and in the distance an old red school- house.  And the boys are no longer the lively London urchins with their red, white, and blue bouncer.  They are in flannels, and their faces are familiar, and the names they call each other he knows.  Nor is the game the same.  It, like the London boys' game, has ended suddenly, but not in a helter-skelter stampede in the rain.  No.  It is a silent, awe- struck group round something on the ground; and as he, Jeffreys, elbows his way among them, he sees again a boy's face lying there pallid and perhaps lifeless.  Then instinctively he lifts his hands to his ears. For a howl rises on all sides which deafens him, stuns him.  After all, it is only the last effort of the October squall in Regent's Park buffeting him with a fusillade of rain and withered leaves.  He takes his hands from his ears, and with a sigh gets up and walks away, he cares not whither.  His steps lead him round the park and into the long avenue.  The rain and the wind are dying down, and already a few wayfarers, surprised by the sudden storm, are emerging from their shelters and speeding home. The park-keeper boldly parades the path in his waterproof, as if he had braved the elements since daybreak.  A nursemaid draws out her perambulator from under the trees and hastens with it and its wailing occupant nursery-wards.  And there, coming to meet him, sheltered under one umbrella, are two who perhaps have no grudge against the storm for detaining them in their walk that afternoon.  It is long since Jeffreys has seen anything to remind him of the world he has left, but there is something about these two as they advance towards him, their faces hidden by the umbrella, which attracts him. The youth is slim and well-dressed, and holds himself well; his companion's figure reminds him of a form he knew--can it be only six months ago?--light, gentle, courageous, beside which he has walked in the Wildtree Park and on the London pavements.  Ah, how changed now!  Where, he wonders, is _she_ now? and what is she thinking of him, if she thinks of him at all?  They meet--the tramp and the young couple.  They never heed him; how should they?  But a turn of the umbrella gives him a momentary glimpse of them, and in that glimpse poor hapless Jeffreys recognises Raby and Scarfe!  Surely this blow was not needed to crush him completely! Scarfe!  How long he stood, statue-like, looking down the path by which they had gone neither he nor any one else could tell.  But it was dark when he was roused by a harsh voice in front of him.  \"Come, sheer off, young fellow!  It's time you was out of the park!\"  \"Yes, I'll go,\" said he, and walked slowly to the gate.  It was ridiculous of him, of course, to writhe as he did under that chance meeting.  What else could he have expected?  A hundred times already he had told himself she had forgotten all about him, or, worse still, she remembered him only to despise him.  And a hundred times, too, he had seen her in fancy beside the enemy who had stabbed him.  For Scarfe might have spared his precaution in begging Mrs Rimbolt not to name him as Jeffreys' accuser.  Jeffreys needed no telling to whom he owed his ruin, and he needed no telling the reason why.  That reason had made itself clear this afternoon, at any rate, and as the wretched outcast wandered out into the night, it seemed as if the one ray of light which yesterday had glimmered for him, even across the darkness, was now quenched for ever, and that there was nothing left either to hope or dread.  He could not quit the park, but wandered round and round it, outside its inhospitable palings, covering mile after mile of wet pavement, heedless of the now drenching rain, heedless of his hunger, heedless of his failing limbs.  The noisy streets had grown silent, and a clock near at hand had struck two when he found himself on the little bridge which crosses the canal. It was too dark to see the water below, but he heard the hard rain hissing on its surface.  He had stood there before, in happier days, and wondered how men and women could choose, as they sometimes did, to end their misery in that narrow streak of sluggish water.  He wondered less now.  Not that he felt tempted to follow them; in his lowest depths of misery that door of escape had never allured him.  Yet as he stood he felt fascinated, and even soothed, by the ceaseless noise of the rain on the invisible water beneath.  It seemed almost like the voice of a friend far away.  He had been listening for some time, crouched in a dark corner of the parapet, when he became aware of footsteps approaching.  Imagining at first they were those of a policeman coming to dislodge the tramp from his lurking-place, he prepared to get up and move on.  But listening again he remained where he was.  The footsteps were not those of a policeman.  They approached fitfully, now quickly, now slowly, now stopping still for a moment or two, yet they were too agitated for those of a drunkard, and too uncertain for those of a fugitive from justice.  As they drew near to the bridge they stopped once more, and Jeffreys, peering through the darkness, saw a form clutching the railings, and looking down in the direction of the water.  Then a voice groaned, \"Oh my God!\" and the footsteps hurried on.  Jeffreys had seen misery in many forms go past him before, but something impelled him now to rise and follow the footsteps of this wanderer.  The plashing rain drowned every sound, and it was with difficulty that Jeffreys, weak and weary as he was, could keep pace with the figure flitting before him, for after that glance over the bridge the fugitive no longer halted in his pace, but went on rapidly.  Across the bridge he turned and followed the high banks of the canal. Then he halted, apparently looking for a way down.  It was a long impatient search, but at last Jeffreys saw him descend along some railings which sloped down the steep grass slope almost to the towing- path.  Jeffreys followed with difficulty, and when at last he stood on the towing-path the fugitive was not to be seen, nor was it possible to say whether he had turned right or left.  Jeffreys turned to the right, and anxiously scanning both the bank and the water, tramped along the muddy path.  A few yards down he came upon a heap of stones piled up across the path. Any one clambering across this must have made noise enough to be heard twenty yards away, and, as far as he could judge in the darkness, no one had stepped upon it.  He therefore turned back hurriedly and retraced his steps.  The sullen water, hissing still under the heavy rain, gave no sign as he ran along its edge and scanned it with anxious eyes.  The high bank on his left, beyond the palings, became inaccessible from below.  The wanderer must, therefore, be before him on the path.  For five minutes he ran on, straining his eyes and ears, when suddenly he stumbled.  It was a hat upon the path.  In a moment Jeffreys dived into the cold water.  As he came to the surface and looked round there was nothing but the spreading circles of his own plunge to be seen; but a moment afterwards, close to the bank, he had a glimpse of something black rising for an instant and then disappearing.  Three strokes brought him to the spot just as the object rose again.  To seize it and strike out for the bank was the work of a moment.  The man--for it was he--was alive, and as Jeffreys slowly drew him from the water he opened his eyes and made a faint resistance.  \"Let me go!\" he said with an oath; \"let me go!\"  But his head fell heavily on his rescuer's shoulder while he spoke, and when at last he lay on the path he was senseless.  Jeffreys carried him to the shelter of an arch, and there did what he could to restore animation.  It was too dark to see the man's face, but he could feel his pulse still beating, and presently he gave a sigh and moved his head.  \"What did you do it for?\" he said piteously.  Jeffreys started.  He knew the voice, hoarse and choked as it was.  \"What's your name?\" he said, raising the form in his arms and trying to see the face.  \"Who are you?\"  \"I've got no name!  Why couldn't you let me be?\"  \"Isn't your name Trimble--Jonah Trimble?\"  The poor fellow lifted his head with a little shriek.  \"Oh, don't give me up!  Don't have me taken up!  Help me!\"  \"I will help you all I can, Trimble.\"  \"Why, you know me, then?--you're--Who are you?\"  \"I'm John Jeffreys.\"    CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.  AN ANGEL UNAWARES.  In a wretched garret of a house in Storr Alley, near Euston, at the sick-bed of his old enemy, Jeffreys reached a turning-point in his life. How he conveyed the half-drowned Jonah on the night of the rescue from the canal bank to his lodgings he scarcely knew.  The hand of a friend is often near when it is least expected.  So Jonah had found, when he believed all hope and life to be gone; and so Jeffreys had found, when, with his poor burden in his arms, he met, beside a barge at daybreak, a dealer in vegetables for whom he had sometimes worked at Covent Garden, and who now, like a Good Samaritan, not only gave the two a lift in his cart, but provided Jeffreys with an opportunity of earning a shilling on the way.  This shilling worked marvels.  For both Trimble and Jeffreys were on the verge of starvation; and without food that night rescue would have been but a farce.  It was soon evident that Jonah had far more the matter with him than the mere effects of his immersion.  He was a wreck, body and soul.  The dispensary doctor who called to see him gave him a fortnight to live, and the one or two brave souls who penetrated, on errands of mercy, even into Storr Alley, marked his hollow cough and sunken cheeks, and knew that before long one name more would drop out of their lists.  It was slowly, and in fragments only, that Jeffreys heard his story. Jonah was for ever reproaching him with what had happened on the canal bank.  \"Why couldn't you have left a fellow alone?  I know, you wanted to gloat over me.  Go on, be as happy as you like.  Enjoy your revenge.  I did you a bad turn; now you've done me one, so we're quits!\"  Here a fit of coughing would shake the breath out of the sufferer, and it would be a minute or two before he could proceed.  Jeffreys wisely avoided all expostulations or self-excuse.  He smoothed the poor fellow's pillow, and supported him in his arms till the cough was over and he could proceed.  \"It was a bad day you ever came to our school, John\"--Jonah had adopted the name by which Jeffreys was known in Storr Alley--\"I hated you the first time I saw you.  You've got the laugh on your side now; but I can tell you you wouldn't have had it then if you knew the way I followed you up.  Yes\"--and here came a shadow of his own sinister smile--\"I made it all fit in like a puzzle.  Did you never miss a letter you had that day you called at the York post- office--a letter about the dead burying their dead, and young Forrester? oh yes, you may start; I know all about it.  I took that letter out of your pocket.  And I know where you buried his body; do you suppose I didn't see you throw yourself on the very place and say, `It was here'? You held your nose in the air, didn't you, in the school, and palmed yourself off on Freddy and Teddy for a model?  But I bowled you out.  I showed you up.  That was the day of my laugh.  Now you've got yours.\"  The cough again stopped him; and when he recovered his breath Jeffreys said quietly--  \"Don't talk, Jonah; you bring on your cough.  Let me read to you.\"  Then for the remainder of that day the story would rest; till later on Jonah would abruptly return to it.  \"Mother believed in you, and cried a whole day after you had gone.  Yes, and you'll be glad to hear the school broke up all to pieces.  Farmer Rosher took away his boys and spread a report about us; and at the end of a month we had scarcely a dozen urchins.  Mother and I lived like cat and dog.  I struck work, and she had to do everything, and it broke her up.  It would never have happened if you hadn't come into the place.  I couldn't live there any longer.  Mother had a little bit saved, fifty pounds or so, and one night, after we had had a terrible row, I took every penny of it out of her money-box and came up to London.  Now are you pleased?  Hadn't she something to bless you for?  I say, John, get us some water quick, I'm parched!\"  On another day Jeffreys heard the rest.  \"I came up to London, but it wasn't the fun I expected.  Everybody I met I thought was a detective, and all night long I dreamed of my mother.  I tried to drown it, and lived as wild a life as you like till my money was done.  Then it would have been worth your while to see me. Everybody was against me.  Fellows I'd stood treat to kicked me out into the street, and fellows who owed me money laughed in my face.  I thought I'd go back to York after all and get mother to take me back; but when I came to start I couldn't face it.  That's all.  I stood it as long as I could.  I pawned everything, and when that was done I stole--and got three months on the treadmill.  How do you like that?  When I got out, a city missionary heard of me and found me a job; but I stole again, and ran away.  You wouldn't have thought I had it in me at York, would you? I was a respectable young fellow there.  But it was all there; and it was you brought it all out.  Last week I made up my mind to put an end to it all.  It took me a struggle to face it; but I was settled to do it--and then, as if you hadn't done enough harm, you come and spoil my last chance.\"  \"Not your last chance, Jonah.\"  \"No.  I've a week more to live.  Then you'll be rid of me.  Who's to save me then?\"  \"Some one, Jonah.  We have both forgotten Him, but He's not forgotten us.\"  \"Oh yes, I know,\" said Jonah; \"but it's all very well for you, who've got years to get right in.  It's too short notice for me to begin all that over again.  I don't want to hear about it.\"  He lingered on day after day, and it was absolutely necessary for Jeffreys to go and seek work in order to keep even that wretched roof above their heads.  One evening when he returned with a few coppers, Jonah met him with a face brighter than any that he had yet seen.  \"I've had some one here to-day.  A better sort than you.  One that's got a right to talk about what's better.  A lady, John, or else an angel. Did _you_ send her?\"  \"I?  No; I know no ladies.\"  \"I don't know how it was, I could tell her anything--and, I say, John, it would make you cry to hear her voice.  It did me.  _You_ never made me cry, or saw me; I hate to hear _you_ preach; but she--why, she doesn't preach at all, but she says all you've got to say a hundred times better.\"  He was excited and feverish that night, and in his sleep murmured scraps of the gentle talk of his ministering angel, which even from his lips fell with a reflected sweetness on the trouble-tossed spirit of the watcher.  Jeffreys had succeeded in getting a temporary job which took him away during the next two days.  But each night on his return he found his invalid brighter and softened in spirit by reason of his angel's visits.  \"She'll come to-morrow, John.  There's magic in her, I tell you.  I see things I never saw before.  You've been kind to me, John, and given up a lot for me, but if you were to hear her--\"  Here the dying youth could get no farther.  He seemed much the same in the morning when Jeffreys started for work. The last words he said as his friend departed were--  \"She's coming again to-day.\"  When Jeffreys came home in the evening the garret was silent, and on the bed lay all that remained on earth of the poor wrecked life which had been so strangely linked with his own.  As he stood over the lifeless body his eyes fell on a scrap of paper lying on the pillow.  It was folded and addressed in pencil, \"To the fellow-lodger.\"  Jeffreys caught it eagerly, and in a turmoil of agitation read the few lines within.  \"Your friend was not alone when he died, peacefully, this afternoon.  He left a message for you.  `Tell him he was right when he told me I had a chance.  If it had not been for him I should have lost it.'  He also said, `Some day he may see mother and tell her about me.  Tell her I died better than I lived.'  Dear friend, whose name I do not know, don't lose heart.  God is merciful, and will be your friend when every one else is taken from you.\"  It was not the words of this touching little message from the dead which brought a gasp to Jeffreys' throat and sent the colour from his cheeks as he read it.  The writing, hasty and agitated as it was, was a hand he had seen before.  He had in his pocket an envelope, well-worn now, addressed to him months ago in the same writing, and as he held the two side by side he knew Raby had written both.  He quitted the garret hurriedly, and entered the room of a family of five who lived below him.  \"Mrs Pratt,\" said he to the ragged woman who sat nursing her baby in the corner, \"did you see who Trimble had with him when he died?\"  \"He's dead, then, sir\"--these fellow-lodgers of Jeffreys called him \"sir\" in spite of his misery.  \"I knew that cough couldn't last.  My Annie's begun with it: she'll go too.  It's been hard enough to keep the children, but it will be harder to lose them!\" she cried.  Jeffreys went to the bed where the little consumptive girl lay in a restless sleep, breathing heavily.  \"Poor little Annie!\" said he; \"I did not know she was so ill.\"  \"How could you?  Yes, I saw the lady come down--a pretty wee thing.  She comes and goes here.  Maybe when she hears of Annie she'll come to her.\"  \"Do you know her name?\"  \"No.  She's a lady, they say.  I heard her singing upstairs to Trimble; it was a treat!  So Trimble's dead.  You'll be glad of some help, I expect?  If you'll mind the children, Mr John, I'll go up and do the best we can for the poor fellow.\"  And so Jeffreys, with the baby in his arms, sat beside the little invalid in that lonely room, while the mother, putting aside her own sorrows, went up and did a woman's service where it was most needed. Next day he had the garret to himself.  That letter--how he treasured it!--changed life for him.  He had expected, when Jonah's illness ended, to drift back once more into the bitterness of despair.  But that was impossible now.  He made no attempt to see the angel of whose visits to the alley he now and again heard.  Indeed, whether he was in work or not, he left early and came back late on purpose to avoid a meeting.  He had long been known by his neighbours only as John, so that there was no chance of her discovering who he was.  Sometimes the memory of that October day in Regent's Park came up to haunt him and poison even the comfort of the little letter.  Yet why should she not have forgotten him? and why should not Scarfe, the man with a character, be more to her than he, the man with none?  Yet he tried bravely to banish all, save the one thought that it _was_ she who bade him hope and take courage.  He worked well and patiently at the temporary manual labour on which he was employed, and when that came to an end he looked about resolutely for more.  Meanwhile--do not smile, reader--he made an investment of capital!  In other words, he spent threepence in pen, ink, paper, and a candle, and spent one night in his lonely garret writing.  It was a letter, addressed to a stranger, on a public question.  In other words, it was an article to a London paper on, \"Life in a Slum, by One who Lives There.\"  It was a quiet, unsensational paper, with some practical suggestions for the improvement of poor people's dwellings, and a few true stories of experiences in which the writer himself had taken a part.  He dropped it doubtfully into the editor's box and tried to forget about it.  He dared not look at the paper next day, and when two days passed and he heard nothing, he concluded that the bolt had missed fire.  But it was not so.  A week later, the postman entered Storr Alley--an unheard-of event--and left a letter.  It contained a money order for ten shillings, and read:--  \"The editor encloses ten shillings for the letter on Slum Life, contributed by Mr John to the paper of the 23rd.  He can take two more on the same subject at the same terms, and suggests that Mr John should deal specially with--\" And here the editor gave an outline of the topics on which the public would be most likely to desire information.  With overflowing heart, and giving Raby the credit, he sat down and wrote the two articles.  His first half-sovereign went in a deed of mercy.  Little Annie lay dead in her bed the night it arrived.  Jeffreys that morning, before he started to work, had watched the little spark of life flicker for the last time and go out.  The mother, worn-out by her constant vigils, lay ill beside her dead child.  The father, a drunkard, out of work, deserted the place, and the two other children, the baby, and the sister scarcely more than baby, wailed all day for cold and hunger.  What could he do but devote the first-fruits of his pen to these companions in distress?  The half-sovereign sufficed for the child's funeral, with a little over for the sick mother.  For the rest, he took the baby to his own garret for a night or two, and tended it there as best he could.  The two fresh letters to the paper in due time brought a sovereign; but at the same time a chilling notification to the effect that the editor did not need further contributions, and would let Mr John know if at any future time he required his services.  It was the abrupt closing of one door of promise.  Still Jeffreys, with hope big within him, did not sit and fret.  Literary work might yet be had, and meanwhile bodily labour must be endured.  Towards the beginning of December, any one taking up one of the London penny papers might have observed, had he been given to the study of such matters, three advertisements.  Here they are in their proper order:--  \"Should this meet the eye of John Jeffreys, late private secretary to a gentleman in Cumberland, he is earnestly requested to communicate with his friend and late employer.\"  Readers of the agony column were getting tired of this advertisement. It had appeared once a week for the last six months, and was getting stale by this time.  The next advertisement was more recent, but still a trifle dull:--  \"Gerard Forrester.  \"If Gerard Forrester (son of the late Captain Forrester, of the-- Hussars) who was last heard of at Bolsover School, in October, 18--, where he met with a serious accident, should see this, he is requested to communicate with Messrs. Wilkins & Wilkins, Solicitors, Blank Street, W.C., from whom he will hear something to his advantage.  Any person able to give satisfactory information leading to the discovery of the said Gerard Forrester, or, in the event of his death, producing evidence of his decease, will be liberally rewarded.\"  The third advertisement, in another column, appeared now for the first time:--  \"A young man, well educated, and a careful student of Bibliography, is anxious for literary work.  Searches made and extracts copied.--Apply, J., 28a, Storr Alley, W.C.\"  It would have puzzled any ordinary observer to detect in these three appeals anything to connect them together.  Jeffreys, however, glancing down the columns of the borrowed paper for a sight of his own advertisement, started and turned pale as his eye fell first on his own name, then on Forrester's.  It was like a conspiracy to bewilder and baffle him at the moment when hope seemed to be returning.  He had convinced himself that his one chance was to break with every tie which bound him to his old life, and to start afresh from the lowest step of all.  And here, at the outset, there met him two calls from that old life, both of which it was hard to resist.  Mr Rimbolt, he decided to resist at all hazards.  He still shuddered as he recalled the stiff rustle of a certain silk dress in Clarges Street, and preferred his present privations a hundredfold. Even the thought of Percy, and the library, and Mr Rimbolt's goodness, could not efface that one overpowering impression.  The other advertisement perplexed and agitated him more.  Who was this unknown person on whose behalf Messrs. Wilkins & Wilkins were seeking information respecting young Forrester?  It might be Scarfe, or Mr Frampton, or possibly some unheard-of relative, interested in the disposal of the late gallant officer's effects.  He could not assist the search.  The little he knew was probably already known to the lawyers, yet it excited him wildly to think that some one besides himself was in search of the lad whose memory had haunted him for so many months, and whom, even in his most despairing moments, he had never quite given up for lost.  True, he had long since ceased to believe that he was really to be found by searching.  Everything combined to baffle search, almost to forbid it, and yet he had constantly lived in a vague expectation of finding or hearing of him some day accidentally and unawares.  But this advertisement filled him with self-reproach.  What right had he to do anything, to rest a day, till he had found this lost boy--lost by his fault, by his sin?  No wonder he had not prospered.  No wonder the bad name had haunted him and dragged him down!  One thing was certain-- whether what he knew was known to others or not, it was his duty to aid now in this new search.  So he wrote as follows to Messrs. Wilkins & Wilkins:--  \"_Private and Confidential_.  \"The writer of this knew Gerard Forrester at Bolsover School two years ago, and was responsible almost wholly for the accident referred to. The writer left Bolsover in consequence, and has not seen Forrester since.  In May of the following year he made inquiries at Grangerham, Forrester's native place, where he ascertained that the boy had been removed there from Bolsover and had remained for some time with his grandmother, Mrs Wilcox.  Mrs Wilcox, however, was ordered to the South for her health, and died at Torquay.  Forrester, who appears to have been a cripple, and unable to help himself, was then left in charge of his old nurse, who left Grangerham shortly afterwards, it is said, in order to take the boy to a hospital--where, no one could say.  That is the last the writer heard.  Messrs. W. & W. might do well to apply to the clergyman and Wesleyan minister at Grangerham, who may have some later news.  The writer would be thankful to be of any service in helping to find one whom he has so terribly wronged; and any letter addressed `J., at Jones's Coffee-House, Drury Lane,' will find him.  \"It should be said that when Forrester was last seen, only faint hopes were held out as to his recovery, even as a cripple.\"  An anxious time followed.  It was hard to work as usual--harder still to wait.  The idea of Forrester being after all found took strange possession of his mind, to the exclusion of all else.  The prospect which had seemed to open before him appeared suddenly blocked; he could think of nothing ahead except that one possible meeting.  So preoccupied was he, that his own advertisement for work was forgotten the day after it appeared; and when two days later he found a letter pushed under the door, his heart leaped to his mouth with the conviction that it could refer to nothing but the one object before him.  It did not; it was a reply to his advertisement.  \"J-- is requested to call to-morrow, at 10 a.m., on Mr Trotter, 6, Porson Square, in reference to his advertisement for literary work.\"  With some trepidation, and no particular expectations, Jeffreys presented himself at the appointed time, and found himself face to face with a testy little gentleman, with by no means large pretensions to literary authority.  He took in the shabby-looking advertiser at a glance, and suited his tone accordingly.  \"So you're the chap, are you?  You're the nice educated literary chap that wants a job, eh?\"  \"I am.\"  \"What can you do?  Write poetry?\"  \"I never tried.\"  \"Write 'istory, or 'igh hart, and that sort of thing?\"  \"I have not tried.  I know mostly about bibliography.\"  \"Bibli--who?  You'll turn your 'and to anything for a crust, I suppose. Do you ever do anything in the puff line?\"  Jeffreys admitted he had not.  \"'Cos I want a chap to crack up my `Polyglot Pickle' in proper literary style.  None of your commonplace maunderings, but something smart and startling.  What do you say?  Can you do it or not?\"  Jeffreys heart sank low.  \"I'll try--\"  \"Can you do it?\" demanded the proud inventor.  \"Yes,\" said Jeffreys desperately.  \"All right,\" said Mr Trotter, greatly relieved.  \"I want a book of twenty pages.  Write anything you like, only bring the pickles in on each page.  You know the style.  Twenty blood-curdling ballads, or Aesop's fables, or something the public's bound to read.  Something racy, mind, and all ending in the pickle.  It's a good thing, so you needn't be afraid of overdoing it.  You shall have a bob a page, money down, or twenty-five bob for the lot if you let me have it this time to- morrow.  Remember, nothing meek and mild.  Lay it on thick.  They're the best thing going, and got a good name.  Polyglot, that's many tongues; everybody tastes 'em.\"  Jeffreys, with a dismal sense of the humour of the situation, accepted his noble task meekly, and sat down in Mr Trotter's back room with a bottle of the pickles on the table before him.  The reader shall be spared the rubbish he wrote.  To this day he flares up angrily if you so much as mention the Polyglot Pickle to him.  The public, who laughed next week over the ridiculous bathos of those twenty loud-sounding ballads, little guessed the misery and disgust they had cost their author.  The one part of the whole business that was not odious was that in six hours Jeffreys had twenty-five shillings in his pocket; and to him twenty-five shillings meant a clear week and more in which to devote himself to the now all-absorbing task of seeking young Forrester.  On his way back to Storr Alley that evening he called as usual at the coffee-house, and found a further letter awaiting him:--  \"Messrs. Wilkins & Wilkins will be much obliged if the writer of the letter of the sixth inst. will favour them with a call on Wednesday forenoon, as he may be able to assist them materially in the search in which they are engaged.  Messrs. W. & W. will treat an interview as confidential.\"    CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.  HIGH DUDGEON.  Things had not been going well with Percy Rimbolt since we saw him last, six or eight months ago, just before Jeffreys' expulsion from the house in Clarges Street.  Mrs Rimbolt had some reason to modify her self- congratulations on that occasion, when Percy and Raby, who, it will be remembered, had been out riding at the time, returned home.  Percy returned in high spirits; his new horse had turned out a beauty, and the canter in the park had acted like a tonic.  \"Hullo, mother!\" he said, as his parent came into the hall to meet him. \"We've had a grand time, Raby and I.  We saw the Prince of Wales and W.G.  Grace, and the Queen, and everybody, and I gave Raby two hundred yards from the corner and ran her down before we were off Knightsbridge, and nearly got hauled up for furious riding.  I say, I mean to make father get a horse for old Jeff, and we'll go out early in the mornings, when the Row's empty, and try handicaps, eh, Raby?  Where's Jeff, I say?\" and he ran whistling upstairs.  His mother, with some premonitory misgivings followed him.  \"Where are you, Jeff?\" she heard him shout.  \"I say, mother,\" he added, as Mrs Rimbolt approached, \"where's Jeff?  Is he out?\"  \"He is,\" said Mrs Rimbolt solemnly.  \"I want to speak to you, Percy.\"  \"All right.  But I say, when will he be in?  He said he couldn't leave his work this afternoon.  I want him to see Bendigo before he goes round to the stables.\"  \"You had better tell the groom he need not wait, and then please come to my room, Percy,\" said Mrs Rimbolt.  Percy shouted down to Walker to send away the horse, and followed his mother into her boudoir.  \"Percy, my dear boy,\" began the lady, \"I am sorry to say I have just had to perform a very unpleasant duty.  You can hardly understand--\"  \"What about--anything about Jeff?\" interrupted the boy, jumping at the truth.  \"It is.  It has been necessary, for everybody's sake, that he should leave here.\"  \"What!\" thundered Percy, turning pale and clutching the back of his chair; \"you've sent Jeff away--kicked him out?\"  \"Come, Percy, don't be unreasonable.  I--\"  \"When did he go--how long ago?\" exclaimed the boy, half frantic.  \"Percy, you really--\"  \"How long ago?\"  \"It is more than an hour since--\"  Percy waited to hear no more; he dashed down the stairs and shouted to Walker.  \"Did you see Jeffreys go?  Which way did he go?\"  \"I didn't see--\"  \"Come and help me look for him, he's sure to be about.  Tell Appleby, do you hear?  Raby, I say,\" he exclaimed, as his cousin appeared in the hall, \"Jeff's been kicked out an hour ago!  I'm going to find him!\" and the poor lad, with a heart almost bursting, flung open the door and rushed out into the street.  Alas! it was a fool's errand, and he knew it.  Still, he could not endure to do nothing.  After two weary hours he gave it up, and returned home dispirited and furious.  Walker and Appleby had taken much less time to appreciate the uselessness of the search, and had returned an hour ago from a perfunctory walk round one or two neighbouring streets.  Our young Achilles, terrible in his wrath, would see no one, not even his mother, not even Raby.  Once or twice that evening they heard the front door slam, and knew he once more was on the look-out.  Mrs Rimbolt, alarmed at the storm which she had raised, already repented of her haste, and telegraphed to Mr Rimbolt to come to London.  Raby, bewildered and miserable, shut herself up in her room and was seen by no one.  It was a wretched night for everybody; and when next morning Mrs Rimbolt, sitting down to breakfast, was met with the news that neither Master Percy nor Miss Raby wanted breakfast, she began to feel that the affair was being overdone.  When Mr Rimbolt arrived, though he concealed his feelings better, he was perhaps the most mortified of all at the wretched misadventure which during his absence had turned Jeffreys adrift beyond recall.  He had known his secretary's secret, and had held it sacred even from his wife. And watching Jeffreys' brave struggle to live down his bad name, he had grown to respect and even admire him, and to feel a personal interest in the ultimate success of his effort.  Now, a miserable accident, which, had he been at home, could have been prevented by a word, had wrecked the work and the hopes of years, and put beyond Mr Rimbolt's power all further chance of helping it on.  About a week after Mr Rimbolt's return, when all but Percy were beginning to settle down again into a semblance of their old order of things, Raby knocked at her uncle's door and inquired if he was busy. She looked happier than he had seen her since his return.  The reason was easy to guess.  The post had brought her a letter from her father.  \"I thought you would like to see it,\" said she.  \"He has got leave at last, and expects to be home at the end of September.  Will you read the letter?\" added she, colouring; \"there's something else in it I should like you to see.\"  The letter was chiefly about the prospects of coming home.  Towards the close Lieutenant-Colonel Atherton (for he had got promotion) wrote:  \"You ask me to tell you about poor Forrester and his family.\"  \"He had no wife alive, and when he died did not know what had become of his only son.  The boy was at school in England--Bolsover School--and met with an accident, caused, it is said, by the spite of a schoolfellow, which nearly killed him, and wholly crippled him.  He was taken home to his grandmother's, but after she died he disappeared, and poor Forrester had been unable to hear anything about him.  It is a sad story.  I promised Forrester when I got home I would do what I could to find the boy and take care of him.  You will help, won't you?\"  Raby watched her uncle as he read the passage, and then asked,--  \"I asked father to tell me something about the Forresters, uncle, because some one--it was Mr Scarfe--had told me that he believed Captain Forrester was the father of an old schoolfellow of his at Bolsover who had a bad accident.\"  \"Is that all he told you?\" asked her uncle.  \"No,\" said Raby, flushing; \"he told me that Mr Jeffreys had been the cause of the accident.\"  \"That was so,\" said Mr Rimbolt.  \"Sit down, child, and I'll tell you all about it.\"  And her uncle told her what he had heard from Mr Frampton, and what Jeffreys had suffered in consequence; how he had struggled to atone for the past, and what hopes had been his as to the future.  Raby's face glowed more and more as she listened.  It was a different soldier's tale from what she was used to; but still it moved her pity and sympathy strangely.  \"It's a sad story, as your father says,\" concluded Mr Rimbolt; \"but the sadness does not all belong to young Forrester.\"  Raby's eyes sparkled.  \"No, indeed,\" said she; \"it is like shipwreck within sight of the harbour.\"  \"We can only hope there may be some hand to save him even from these depths,\" said Mr Rimbolt; \"for, from what I know of Jeffreys, he will find it hard now to keep his head above water.  Of course, Raby, I have only told you this because you have heard the story from another point of view which does poor Jeffreys injustice.\"  \"I am so grateful to you,\" said the girl.  Mr Rimbolt let her go without saying more.  Even the man of books had eyes that could see; and Raby's face during this interview had told a tale of something more than casual sympathy.  The season dragged on, and nothing occurred to mend matters at Clarges Street.  Percy moped and could settle down to nothing.  He spurned his books, he neglected his horse, and gave up the river entirely.  It was vain to reason or expostulate with him, and after a couple of months his parents marked with anxiety that the boy was really ill.  Yet nothing would induce him to quit London.  Even his father's offer to take him abroad for a few weeks did not tempt him.  Raby herself made the final appeal the day before they started.  \"Percy, dear, won't you come for my sake?\" said she.  \"If I came for anybody I would for you,\" replied he, \"but I can't.\"  \"But I had so looked forward to you seeing father.\"  \"I'll see him as soon as he gets to town.\"  \"It will spoil my pleasure so much,\" said she.  \"I shall be miserable thinking of you.\"  \"You're an awful brick, Raby; but don't bother about me.  You'd all be ever so much more miserable if I came, and so should I.\"  \"But what good can it do?\" pleaded his cousin.  \"I don't know--he might turn up.  I might find him after all.  If it hadn't been for your father coming, Raby--I'd have begged you to stay too.  He'd be more likely to come if he knew _you_ were here.\"  Raby flushed.  Between Percy and his cousin there was no hypocrisy.  \"Oh, Percy,\" she said, \"do you want to make me fifty times more miserable?\"  And she gave up further attempt to move him.  The travellers were away a month, during which time Percy kept his lonely vigil at Clarges Street.  As the reader knows, it was useless. Jeffreys was never near the place, and the lad, watching day after day, began slowly to lose hope.  But that month's experience was not wholly wasted.  Memories of bygone talks with his friend, of good advice given, and quiet example unheeded at the time, crowded in on Percy's memory now; adding to his sense of loss, certainly, but reminding him that there was something else to be done than mope and fret.  What would Jeffreys have had him do? he often asked himself; and the answer was plain and direct--work.  That had always been Jeffreys' cure for everything.  That is what he would have done himself, and that is what Percy, chastened by his loss, made up his mind to now.  He got out his old books and his tools, and doggedly took up the work where he had left it.  It was uphill, cheerless work, but he was better for it, and the memory of his lost friend became none the less dear for the relief it brought him.  Only one incident marked his solitary month at Clarges Street--that was a visit from Scarfe about a fortnight after the travellers had gone. Percy had a very shrewd guess, although he had never heard it in so many words, who was responsible for Jeffreys' disgrace and dismissal; and that being so, it is not to be wondered at that his welcome of the visitor was not very cordial.  \"Look here,\" said he, as Scarfe entered, and making no movement to return his greeting, \"is it true you were the fellow who told mother about Jeff, and had him sent away from here?\"  \"My dear Percy--\"  \"I'm not your dear Percy!  Did you tell mother that story about Jeffreys?\"  \"Why, Percy, you don't mean to say--\"  \"Shut up!  You can Yes or No, can't you?\"  \"I did my duty, and it's a mercy you're all rid of him!\" said Scarfe, losing temper at being thus browbeaten by a boy of Percy's age.  \"Very well, you can go!  You're a cad, and you're not wanted here!\" said Percy.  \"You young prig!\" began the visitor; but Percy stopped him.  \"Look here,\" said he, \"if you want to fight, say so, and come on!  If you don't, go!  You're a cad!\"  Scarfe was staggered by this outbreak; he never suspected the boy had it in him.  He tried to turn the matter off with a laugh.  \"Come, don't be a muff, Percy!  You and I are old friends--\"  \"We're not; we're enemies!\"  \"You mean to say,\" said Scarfe, with a snarl, \"you're going to throw me up for the sake of a--\"  \"Don't say a word about Jeff!\" said Percy, white-hot, and springing to his feet; \"if you do I'll have you pitched neck and crop into the street!  Hook it!  No one asked you here, and you're not wanted!\"  \"I came to see your mother,\" said Scarfe.  \"I can't congratulate you, Percy, on your hospitality, but I can hope you'll be better next time I come.\"  Percy went out after him, and called down the staircase to Walker, \"Walker, give Mr Scarfe a glass of wine and some grub before he goes.\"  The taunt about hospitality had stung him, and this was how he relieved his conscience on that point.  Scarfe was not the only visitor Percy had.  The evening before the travellers were expected home Walker announced that a gentleman had called inquiring for Mr Rimbolt, but hearing he was from home, desired to speak with his son.  Percy, ready to clutch at any straw of hope, and jumping at once to the conclusion that the only business on which any one could possibly call at the house was about Jeffreys, told Walker to show the gentleman up.  He was a dark, handsome man, with a few streaks of grey in his hair, and a keen, cold look in his eye which Percy mistrusted.  \"We're old friends, I fancy,\" said he, nodding to the boy as he entered. \"At least, I fancy I saw you sixteen or seventeen years ago.\"  \"I must have been jolly young then,\" said Percy.  \"You were--about a week.  Your father and I were college friends.  I gave him up as a deserter when he married, and might have cut his acquaintance altogether, only as he happened to marry my sister, I was bound to keep up appearances and come and inspect my nephew when he made his appearance.\"  \"You're my Uncle Halgrove, then?  I thought you were dead.\"  \"I sympathise keenly with your disappointment.  I am alive and well, and hoped to find my brother-in-law at home.\"  \"They'll be back to-morrow,\" said Percy.  \"Have you dined, my boy?\"  \"No, not yet.\"  \"That's well; they can lay for two.  I'll sleep here to-night.\"  Percy scrutinised his uncle critically.  \"Look here, uncle,\" he said, rather nervously, \"it may be all right, you know, and I'd be awfully sorry not to be civil.  But I never saw you before, and didn't know you were alive.  So I think you'd better perhaps stay at your hotel to-night and come to-morrow, when they all come home. Do you mind?\"  \"Mind?\" said Mr Halgrove.  \"I'm delighted if you are.  You prefer solitude, so do I.  Or perhaps you've been a naughty boy, and are left behind for your sins.\"  \"I've stayed behind because I didn't want to go,\" said Percy.  \"Well,\" said Mr Halgrove, \"I am sure your relatives are the sufferers by your decision.  By the way, one of the things I came to see your father about was to ask him to help me out of a money difficulty.  I've just landed from America, and my remittances are not here to meet me. Consequently I am in the ridiculous position of not being able to pay for the luxury of an hotel.  But I understand there are nice clean railway-arches at Victoria, and that crusts are frequently to be met with in the gutters if one keeps his eye open.\"  Percy was perplexed.  \"Do you mean you're really hard up?\" said he, \"because if you really are, of course you'd better put up here.\"  \"But I may be a fraud, you know.  I may rob the house and murder you in your bed,\" said his uncle, \"and that would be a pity.\"  \"I'll take my chance of that,\" said Percy.  And so it happened that the house in Clarges Street had a visitor on the last night of Percy's lonely month.  The boy and his uncle began the evening with a great deal of suspicion and mutual aversion.  But it wore off as the hours passed. Mr Halgrove had a fund of stories to tell, and the boy was a good listener; and when at last they adjourned to bed they were on friendly terms.  Percy, however, took the precaution to take away the front-door key, so that the visitor could not abscond from the house during the night without his knowledge.  The precaution was unnecessary.  Mr Halgrove rang his bell for shaving water at ten next morning with the confidence of one who had lived in the house all his life.  A few hours later the travellers arrived in London.    CHAPTER TWENTY SIX.  HIDE AND SEEK.  Percy was in considerable difficulty as to the ceremonies to be observed in welcoming his family home.  For he had no notion of leaving the house in possession of his suspicious uncle while he went down to the station. Nor could he bear the idea of not being at the station to meet them. So he compromised matters by taking his complaisant relative with him, much to that gentleman's amusement.  It relieved him considerably, when the train arrived, to see that his mother recognised the stranger, though not effusively, as her veritable brother.  He was thus able to devote his whole attention to his other uncle, whom he found considerably more interesting.  Colonel Atherton arrived in high spirits, like a schoolboy home for a holiday.  He struck up an alliance with Percy at once, and insisted on taking him off to the apartments near Regent's Park which were to be his and Raby's home for the next few months.  As he was saying good-bye to the Rimbolts, he caught sight for the first time of Mr Halgrove.  \"Why, bless me, is that you, Halgrove?\" he said.  \"Why, I've worn mourning for you, my boy.  This is a bit of sharp practice.  Where did you spring from?\"  \"Perhaps I'm a ghost, after all.  So many people have told me lately I'm dead, that I begin to believe it.\"  \"Never fear.  If you were a ghost we should be able to see through you-- that's more than anybody ever did with Halgrove, eh, Rimbolt?\"  \"Halgrove is coming home with us,\" said Mr Rimbolt, \"so when you and Raby come to-morrow we can talk over old times.\"  \"Who would have thought of him turning up?\" said the colonel to his daughter as with Percy they drove off in their cab.  \"Why, I've not heard of him since that affair of poor Jeffreys, and--\"  \"Jeffreys!\" exclaimed Percy, with a suddenness that startled the gallant officer; \"did you say Jeffreys?\"  \"Yes, what about him?  It was long before your time--a dozen or fourteen years ago.\"  \"Why, he couldn't have been more than eight then; what happened to him, uncle, I say?\"  The boy asked his question so eagerly and anxiously that it was evident it was not a case of idle curiosity.  \"You must be meaning the son; I'm talking about the father.  Wait till we get home, my boy, and you shall hear.\"  It required all Percy's patience to wait.  The very mention of his friend's name had excited him.  It never occurred to him there were hundreds of Jeffreys in the world, and that his uncle and he might be interested in quite different persons.  For him there was but one Jeffreys in the universe, and he jumped at any straw of hope of finding him.  The reader knows all Colonel Atherton was able to tell Percy and Raby-- for Raby was not an uninterested listener--of the story of Mr Halgrove's partner.  Percy in turn told what he knew of his Jeffreys; and putting the two stories together, it seemed pretty clear it was a history of parent and son.  Early next morning the colonel was at Clarges Street, seated in the study with his two old college friends.  \"Well,\" said he, \"here's a case of we three meeting again with a vengeance.  And what have you been up to, Halgrove, these twenty years? No good, I'll be bound.\"  \"I have at least managed to keep clear of matrimony,\" said Mr Halgrove, \"which is more than either of you virtuous family men can say.\"  \"Ah, well,\" said the colonel, with a sigh, \"that's not all misfortune-- witness my sweet daughter and Rimbolt's fine boy.  What have you got to show against that?\"  \"Nothing, I confess.\"  \"By the way, though, haven't you?  The last I heard of you was in the papers; a record of a generous act on your part.  You had adopted the son of an unfortunate partner of yours who had died.  Is he still with you?\"  \"No,\" said Mr Halgrove; \"that turned out an unfortunate speculation in every way.\"  \"Did the boy bolt?\"  \"Not exactly.  I sent him to a first-rate school, where he distinguished himself in a way of his own by an act of homicide.\"  \"What?\" exclaimed the colonel; and Mr Rimbolt suddenly became attentive.  \"Yes.  He either quite or very nearly did for a young schoolfellow in a fit of the tantrums, and found it convenient to quit the place rather abruptly.\"  \"What was the name of the school?\" asked Mr Rimbolt quietly.  \"Bolsover, in --shire.\"  \"Singular!\" exclaimed the colonel.  \"I had a chum in India who had a boy at that very school.\"  Here the speaker became aware of a sharp kick under the table and a significant look from Mr Rimbolt.  The old soldier was used to obey the word of command at a moment's notice and pulled up now.  \"I should think a thing like that would be very bad for the school,\" said Mr Rimbolt quietly, and in an off-hand way.  \"Fatal,\" said Mr Halgrove.  \"I believe Bolsover went to the dogs after it.\"  \"And so you had--you had young--what was his name?\"  \"Jeffreys.\"  \"Young Jeffreys on your hands?\"  \"Scarcely.  We parted company.  As I told him, I never was particular, but a man must draw the line somewhere, and I drew it at manslaughter.\"  \"What became of him?\"  \"Well, before I went abroad he was usher in a dame school in York.  He may be there still, unless by this time all his pupils are devoured.\"  \"Very unpleasant business for you,\" said Mr Rimbolt.  \"And,\" asked the colonel, with a wink at his brother-in-law, \"did he, like the prodigal, take his portion of goods with him?  I mean what his father left him.\"  Mr Halgrove for a moment raised his brows uncomfortably.  \"No,\" said he; \"Benjamin Jeffreys was an eccentric man, and invested his money in eccentric securities.  His son's money, like the lad himself, went to the dogs, and left me decidedly out of pocket by my term of guardianship.  I really advise neither of you to indulge your philanthropy in adopting somebody else's sons; it doesn't pay.\"  \"Yours certainly was not a lucky experience,\" said Mr Rimbolt; \"however, when you were last heard of, Fame reported that you could afford to drop a little.\"  \"_Fama volat_, and so does money.  No one could repeat the libel now with truth.  The fact is, this visit to an old college friend is a trifle interested.  My journey to the West has turned out badly, and, greatly as I should like it, I could not offer to lend either of you fellows a hundred pounds at this present moment.  So I hope you won't ask me.\"  The talk here took a financial turn, and Mrs Rimbolt presently joining the party, she and her brother were left to themselves while Mr Rimbolt and the colonel took a short stroll.  Mr Rimbolt took the opportunity of telling his brother-in-law what he knew, not only of Jeffreys but of young Forrester, and the colonel told him of his obligation to find if possible the child of his dead companion-in-arms.  \"It's a mixed-up business altogether,\" said he, \"and from all I can judge something of a family matter.  My little girl, Rimbolt, whom you've been so good to, seems to me more interested in this librarian of yours than she would like any one to suspect--eh?\"  \"I have fancied so,\" said Mr Rimbolt, \"sometimes.\"  \"Pleasant to come home and find everybody in the dumps about some person one has never seen.  The sooner the rascal comes to light, the better for everybody and for my holiday.  By the way, Rimbolt, that struck me as fishy about Jeffreys' money, didn't it you?\"  \"It did.  I had never heard anything about Halgrove having a partner.\"  \"I had.  He went out of his mind and died by his own hand; but from what I knew of Halgrove then, I should say it was _he_ who had a weakness for eccentric speculations.  However, the money's gone; so it's all the same for young Jeffreys.\"  Raby found her life at Regent's Park very different from that either at Wildtree or Clarges Street.  Colonel Atherton was a man who hated ceremony of any kind, and had a great idea of letting everybody do as they chose.  Raby consequently found herself her own mistress in a way she had never experienced before.  It was not altogether a delightful sensation; for though she loved her father's companionship and the care of looking after his wants, she often felt the time hang heavy on her hands.  The colonel had a number of old friends to look up, and a great deal of business to do; and Raby, used to company of some sort, found his absences lonely.  Percy was often at the house, but he in his present dismal mood was poor company.  His one topic was Jeffreys; and that to Raby was the last topic on which she felt drawn to talk to any one.  When, therefore, a neighbour suggested to her one day to give an hour or two a week to visiting the poor of the district, Raby hailed the proposal gladly.  It was work she had been used to at Wildtree, and to which she had already had yearnings in London, though Mrs Rimbolt had opposed it.  \"Mind?  Not a bit,\" said her father, when she broached the subject to him, \"as long as you don't get small-pox or get into mischief.  I should like to be a denizen of a slum myself, for the pleasure of getting a visit from you.\"  And so the girl began her work of charity, spending generally an hour a day, under the direction of her friend, in some of the closely packed alleys near.  As she made a point of being home always to welcome her father in the afternoon, her visits were generally paid early in the day, when the men would be away at work and when the chief claimants on her help and pity would be the poor women and children left behind, with sometimes a sick or crippled man unable to help himself.  It was often sad, often depressing work.  But the brave girl with a heart full of love faced it gladly, and felt herself the happier for it day by day.  It was on an afternoon shortly after this new work had been begun that she was overtaken by a sudden October squall as she was hurrying back through Regent's Park towards home.  The morning had been fine, and she had neither cloak nor umbrella.  No cab was within sight; and there was nothing for it but to stand up under a tree till the rain stopped, or walk boldly through it.  She was just debating this question with herself when she became aware of an umbrella over her, and a voice at her side saying,--  \"This is most fortunate.  Miss Atherton.  Who would have thought of meeting you here?\"  It was Scarfe; and Raby would sooner have met any one else in the world.  \"Thank you,\" said she, \"I shall be quite sheltered under this tree. Don't let me detain you.\"  \"Nonsense!\" said he; \"you know I am delighted to be detained so pleasantly.  Won't you come farther under the trees?\"  \"No, I must be home, thank you.  I don't want to be late.\"  But just then the rain came down in such a deluge that she had nothing for it but to give in and stand up for shelter.  \"It seems ages since we met,\" began Scarfe.  Raby had a vivid enough recollection of that evening in the conservatory, but did not contradict him.  \"I called at Clarges Street last month, hoping to see you, but you were away.\"  \"Yes, we were abroad--all but Percy.\"  \"I saw Percy.  Poor fellow, he did not seem himself at all.  Miss Atherton, you must not blame me if I remind you of something we were talking about when I last saw you--\"  \"Please don't, Mr Scarfe; I have no wish to refer to it.\"  \"But I must.  Do you know, Raby, I have thought of no one but you ever since?\"  Raby said nothing, and wished the rain would stop.  \"Is it too much to ask whether, perhaps once or twice, you have thought of me?\"  Raby began to get angry.  Was it not cowardly to get her here at a disadvantage and begin to talk to her about what she had no wish to hear?  \"Yes--I have thought once or twice of you,\" she said.  \"How good of you, Raby!\" said he, trying to take her hand.  \"May I hope it was with something more than indifference--with love?\"  \"Certainly not,\" said she, drawing back her hand, and, in spite of the rain, starting to walk.  Bitterly crestfallen, he walked at her side and held his umbrella over her.  \"You are harsh with me,\" said he reproachfully.  \"I am sorry.  You should not have provoked me.  I asked you not to talk about it.\"  \"I am afraid, Miss Atherton,\" said he, \"some one has been prejudicing you against me.  Percy, perhaps, has been talking about me.\"  Raby walked on without replying.  \"Percy is very angry with me for doing what it was only my duty to do as his friend--and yours.  He misunderstands me, and, I fear, so do you.\"  \"I do not misunderstand you at all,\" said Raby boldly.  \"But I am afraid you do not thank me.\"  \"No.  I have nothing to thank you for.\"  \"I did my duty, at any rate.  I stated the truth, and nothing more, and should have been wrong to allow things to go on without at least trying, for the sake of those for whom I cared, and still care, Miss Atherton, to set them right.  Do I understand you blame me for that?\"  \"Mr Scarfe, you have done a cruel thing to one who never did you harm-- and I see nothing to admire in it.\"  Scarfe sneered.  \"Jeffreys is fortunate in his champion.  Perhaps, at least, Miss Atherton, you will do me the credit of remembering that on one occasion your hero owed his life to me.  I hope that, too, was not cowardly or cruel.\"  \"If he had known the ruin you had in store for him, he would not have thanked you.\"  Raby spoke with downcast eyes, and neither she nor Scarfe perceived the poor tramp on the path, who, as they brushed past him, glanced wistfully round at their faces.  \"He never thanked me,\" said Scarfe.  They walked on some distance in silence.  Then Scarfe said, \"Miss Atherton, you are unfair to me now.  You think I acted out of spite, instead of out of affection--for you.\"  \"It is a kind of affection I don't appreciate, Mr Scarfe; and as the rain has nearly stopped I need not trouble you any more.  Thank you for the shelter, and good-bye.\"  \"You really mean that you reject me--that you do not care for me?\"  \"I do not.  I am sorry to say so--good-bye.\"  And she left him there, bewildered certainly, but in no manner of doubt that she had done with him.  She told her father all about it that evening, and was a good deal reassured by his hearty approval of her conduct.  \"The kindest thing you could have done, instead of letting him dangle after you indefinitely.  Rough on him, perhaps; but that sort of fellow doesn't deserve much letting down.\"  The reader has heard already how in the course of her visits of mercy Raby happened to find Jonah Trimble very near his end, and how she was able to cheer and lighten his dying hours.  Little dreamed she, as she sat by the death-bed that morning, and wrote those few dying words, into whose hands her little letter would fall, or what a spell they would work on the life of him who received them.  From the other neighbours she heard not a little about \"John,\" and sometimes wished she might chance to see him.  But he was away from early morning till late at night, and they never met.  Mrs Pratt in the room below, and her little dying daughter, had many a tale of kindness and devotion to tell about him; and when presently the little life fled, she heard with grateful tears of his act of mercy to the poor overwrought mother, and thanked God for it.  The time passed on, and one day early in December, when she returned home, she found her father in an unwonted state of excitement.  \"There's a clue, Raby, at last!\" he said.  \"A clue, father--you mean about young Forrester?\"  \"About both.  It's the most mixed-up affair I was ever in.  Who do you suppose has written in answer to our advertisement about Forrester?\"  \"Has he replied himself?\" asked Raby disingenuously; for she guessed the truth.  \"Not a bit of it.  The letter's from Jeffreys.  He doesn't sign his name, of course; but he writes to say that he was at Bolsover, and was responsible for the accident, and repeats what Rimbolt knows already about his trying to hear of them in his native place.  There's nothing very fresh about Forrester; but it may lead to our finding Jeffreys.\"  \"Of course,\" said Raby, finding it hard to conceal her emotion, \"he has written to the lawyers.  Does he give an address, then?\"  \"No--only a coffee-house in Drury Lane.  He's evidently on his guard against a trap.  He writes private and confidential; but you can see he is ready to do anything to find Forrester.\"  \"What shall you do?\"  \"Well, Rimbolt says leave it to the lawyers.  Of course we've no right to trap him, and Rimbolt thinks Wilkins & Wilkins had better not mention our names, but let him know they are acting for Forrester's executors. If he's not scared during the first visit or two, he may consent to see me, or Percy--and among us we may be able to help him out of his present condition, which, to judge by his letter, I should fancy is rather reduced.  He has been asked to call at Wilkins' on Wednesday, and they have promised to treat the matter as confidential--and we shall just have to trust they will manage to talk him round.\"    CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.  A BRAND FROM THE BURNING!  Little suspecting the interest which his movements were causing elsewhere, Jeffreys, on the appointed Wednesday, presented himself at Messrs. Wilkins & Wilkins' office.  He was so much changed by eight months' misery and privation that no ordinary acquaintance would have recognised in the broken-down, haggard man who entered the office the once robust and stalwart librarian of Wildtree.  Even Percy would have had to look at him twice to make sure.  Mr Wilkins looked up curiously at his visitor.  \"Ah,\" said he, \"you have called in reference to that advertisement about Gerard Forrester.  Quite so.  Let me see.  I have your letter here, Mr --\"  \"It is not necessary to know my name,\" said Jeffreys.  \"Just as you please.  Of course, as you say you were at Bolsover School with Forrester, and were the cause of his accident, it is hardly worth while making a mystery of it.\"  \"I forgot that.  My name is John Jeffreys.\"  \"Thank you.  It is a very proper thing of you to offer to assist us in our search, and I shall be glad if in the end you should become entitled to the reward which has been offered.\"  \"I would not touch a farthing of it,\" said Jeffreys, with a scorn that astonished the lawyer.  \"Well, that's your affair.  I can understand you have some remorse for what has occurred, and would be glad to help, reward or no reward.\"  \"I would give my life to find young Forrester.  Has anything been heard of him?\"  \"Not much, though we have been able to trace him rather farther than you did.  We found a day or two ago a mention of the case of a lad suffering from the results of an accident such as he appears to have met with in one of the medical papers at the time.  The case was reported as having been treated at Middlesex Hospital, and I find on inquiry there that in the December of that year Gerard Forrester was a patient under treatment for some months, and in the May following was discharged as incurable. That, you see, was more than eighteen months ago.\"  Jeffreys felt his heart thump excitedly as he listened.  It was little enough, but it seemed at least to bring him six months nearer to the object of his search.  \"After that,\" said Mr Wilkins, \"we are unable to discover anything. The address entered against his name in the hospital books, which was probably that of his old nurse, cannot now be found, as the street has been pulled down a year ago, and no one recollects him.  I saw the surgeon at the hospital, who remembered the case, and he explained to me that the boy when he left there might have lived a month or twenty years.  In any case he would always have to lie on his back.  It would be possible, he said, for him to use his hands--indeed, he believed during the last week or two of his stay in the hospital he had amused himself with drawing.\"  \"He was considered good at drawing at Bolsover,\" put in Jeffreys.  \"So he may possibly have been able to earn a living of some sort.  The strange thing is that he does not appear to have written to any one.  He might have communicated with his former head-master, or some of his grandmother's friends at Grangerham, but he has not.  According to Colonel--to my client's account, he does not even appear to have written to his father, though it is possible a letter may have miscarried there. You have heard, no doubt, that his father died in action in Afghanistan in January?\"  \"Yes, I heard that--very gallantly.\"  \"Yes; in fact, the boy would, I believe, if he could be found, be entitled to a pension, besides what little property his father left. The account of the action, as well as our advertisements, have been in the papers.  If Gerard is alive, he is probably somewhere beyond the reach of the press, and for my own part I cannot see how he can be in any but destitute circumstances.\"  This was all there was to say.  But Mr Wilkins' task was not yet done. He had been instructed to ascertain, if possible, something of Jeffreys' present condition, and to sound him as to his willingness to see again some of the friends of his old life.  \"I am afraid,\" said he, \"you too have had reverses, Mr Jeffreys.\"  \"Never mind me, please,\" replied he.  \"You are living near here?\"  \"No.\"  \"You must excuse me if I take an interest in you--as a former schoolfellow of young Forrester's.  You have come through much since then?\"  \"Not more than I deserve,\" said Jeffreys, fidgeting.  \"My client, I think, would have been glad to see you; but as you made a point of this interview being confidential, I was not justified in asking him to be present.\"  \"Oh no.  I don't want to see any one.\"  \"It would be a great help to my client, who is a stranger in London, if you, who know Forrester, would assist him.\"  \"Who is your client, may I ask?\"  \"My client,\" said Mr Wilkins, resolved to make the venture, \"is a Colonel Atherton, an old comrade of Captain Forrester, who has undertaken to try and find the boy and provide for him.\"  Jeffreys started, and replied--  \"No; I will do anything to help by myself, but I do not wish to meet him.\"  \"You know him, then?\"  \"No, I have never seen him.\"  \"He would, I can promise, respect your confidence, Mr Jeffreys.\"  \"I know, but I cannot meet him or any one.  I will do anything he wants about searching for Forrester--he cannot be more anxious about it than I am--but I have every reason for wishing to remain unknown.\"  \"You forget that it is hardly possible he can fail to know your name; and he has friends, some of whom I believe are deeply interested in your welfare.\"  Jeffreys shuddered.  \"I can't say more,\" said he.  \"I will do all I can, but I want to see nobody but you.\"  \"I may, of course, report this interview to my client?\"  \"Of course; I can't prevent that.\"  \"And I must tell him you definitely refuse to meet him.\"  \"Yes.  I cannot see him.\"  \"Or tell him your address?\"  \"No; you know where a letter would find me.\"  \"Well, will you call again--say this day week?\"  \"Yes; to see you alone.\"  Thus the unsatisfactory interview ended.  Mr Wilkins was a man of honour, and felt he had no right to insist on Jeffreys opening communications with the colonel; still less had he the right as he might easily have done, to track his footsteps and discover his hiding-place.  Jeffreys, alive to a sense of insecurity, evidently expected the possibility of some such friendly ruse, for he returned to his work by a long and circuitous course which would have baffled even the cleverest of detectives.  He seriously debated with himself that night the desirability of vacating his garret at Storr Alley and seeking lodgings somewhere else.  His old life seemed hemming him in; and like the wary hare, he felt the inclination to double on his pursuers and give them the slip.  For, rightly or wrongly, he had convinced himself that the one calamity to be dreaded was his recapture by the friends in whose house his bad name had played him so evil a revenge.  Yet how could he leave Storr Alley?  Had he not ties there?  Was it not worth worlds to him to hear now and then, on his return at night, some scrap of news of the ministering angel whose visits cheered the place in his absence?  He shrank more than ever from a chance meeting; but was it not a pardonable self-indulgence to stay where he could hear and even speak of her?  Nor was that his only tie now.  Mrs Pratt, in the room below, had never recovered yet from the illness that had prostrated her at little Annie's death; and night by night Jeffreys had carried the two babies to his own attic in order to give her the rest she needed, and watch over them in their hours of cold and restlessness.  He became an expert nurse.  He washed and dressed those two small brethren--the eldest of whom was barely three--as deftly and gently as if he had been trained to the work.  And he manipulated their frugal meals, and stowed them away in his bed, with all the art of a practised nurse.  How could he desert them now?  How indeed?  That very night, as he sat writing, with the little pair sleeping fitfully on the bed, a head was put in at the door, and a voice said in a whisper, \"Poor Mrs Pratt's gone, John.\"  \"What,\" he said, \"is she dead?\"  \"Yes--all of a sudden--the 'art done it--I know'd she was weak there. Poor dear--and her husband such a bad 'un too, and they do say she was be'ind with her rent.\"  So the woman chattered on, and when at last she went, Jeffreys glanced at his two unconscious charges and went on writing.  No, he could not leave Storr Alley.  In the morning, as usual, he performed their little toilets, and announced to the elder that his mother was gone away, and they might stay upstairs.  Whereat the little orphan was merry, and executed a caper on the bare floor.  A fresh dilemma faced the newly made father.  He must work if he and his family were to eat.  The thirty shillings he had earned last week could not last for ever.  Indeed, the neighbours all seemed to take it for granted he would see to Mrs Pratt's burial; and how could he do otherwise?  That meant a decided pull on his small resources.  For a day or two he might live on his capital, and after that--  He put off that uncomfortable speculation.  The baby began loudly to demand its morning meal; and the three-year-old, having run through its mirth, began to whimper for its mother.  Altogether Jeffreys had a busy time of it.  So busy that when, about mid-day, Tim, who had been perched upon a box at the window to amuse himself at the peril of his neck by looking out into the court below, suddenly exclaimed--\"There she is!\" he bounded from his seat like one electrified, and for the first time realised that _she_ might come and find him!  There was barely a chance of escape.  She had already entered the house; and he became aware of the little flutter which usually pervaded the crowded tenement when she set foot in it.  She had many families to visit, and each grudged her to the next.  The women had yards of trouble to unroll to her sympathy; and the children besieged her for stories and songs.  The sick lifted their heads as they heard her foot on the steps; and even the depraved and vicious and idle set their doors ajar to get a glimpse of her as she passed.  What could he do?  Wait and face her, and perhaps meet her look of scorn, or worse still, of forgiveness? or hide from her?  He debated the question till he heard her enter the chamber of death below.  Then there came over him a vision of her as he had last seen her that October afternoon with Scarfe in Regent's Park.  With a groan he gathered together his papers, and bidding Tim mind the baby till he returned, seized his hat and hurried from the room.  On the dark, narrow staircase he brushed against a dress which he knew must be hers.  For a moment he was tempted to pause, if only for a look at her face; but she passed on, and was gone before he could turn.  He went out miserably into the street, and waited within view of the entrance to the alley till she should come out.  She was long before she appeared--he guessed how those two friendless little orphans would detain her.  When she came her veil was down, and in the crowd on the pavement he lost sight of her in a moment.  Yet he knew her, and all his resolution once more wavered, as he reflected that he was still within reach of her voice and her smile.  He returned anxiously to the attic.  The baby lay asleep on the bed, and Tim, perched on his window seat, was crooning over a little doll.  There was a flower on the table; the scanty furniture of the room had been set in order, and his quick eye even noticed that a rent in Tim's frock which had caused him some concern in the morning had been neatly mended.  Tim came and put the little doll into his hands.  \"She gave it me.  Will she soon come again?\" said the child.  \"Yes; she's sure to come again.\"  \"You ran away; you was afraid.  I wasn't.\"  In a strange turmoil of emotions Jeffreys resumed his writing.  The flower in the cup beside him was only a half-withered aster, yet it seemed to him to perfume the room.  After dark the neighbour put her head into the room.  \"Then you didn't see the lady?\" said she.  \"No; I was out.\"  \"It's a pity.  She's a angel, John.  The way she sat with them poor childer would do you good to see.  I told 'er you 'ad took them, and, bless you, 'er eyes filled with tears to think of a man doing it when you might let them go to the work'us.  Not that I wouldn't do it, John, if I 'adn't six of my own and the mangle and not room to turn round. And Mrs Parkes was a-saying the childer would be welcome in 'er room, only the smells is that bad in 'er corner that there's no living in it except for seasoned bodies.  There's my Polly, you know, John, is eight, and she would look after them now and again, when you're busy.  She's a good child, is Polly, and can write on a slate beautiful.\"  Jeffreys thanked her, and promised to come to an arrangement with Polly, and went on with his work.  In due time the claims of hunger created a diversion, and he and his infants--one on each knee--partook of a comfortable repast of bread and milk.  He had hard work to induce the baby, after it was over, to resume his slumbers.  That young gentleman evidently had a vivid recollection of some one having walked about with him and sung him to sleep in the middle of the day, and he resented now being unceremoniously laid on his back and expected to slumber without persuasion.  Jeffreys had to take him up finally and pace the room for an hour, and about ten o'clock sat down to his interrupted work.  Till midnight he laboured on; then, cold and wearied, he put out his little candle and lay himself beside the children on the bed.  He had scarcely done so when he became aware of a glare at the window, which brought him to his feet in an instant.  It was a fire somewhere.  His first panic that it might be in the house was quickly relieved.  It was not even in Storr Alley, but in one of the courts adjoining.  He looked down from his window.  The alley was silent and empty.  No one there, evidently, had yet had an alarm.  Quickly putting on his boots, he hurried down, and made his way in the direction of the flames.  From below they were still scarcely visible, and he concluded that the fire, wherever it was, must have broken out in a top storey.  Driver's Court, which backed onto Storr Alley, with which it was connected at the far end by a narrow passage, was an unknown land to Jeffreys.  The Jews in Storr's had no dealings with the Samaritans in Driver's; for Storr Alley, poor as it might be, prided itself on being decent and hard-working, whereas Driver's--you should have heard the stories told about it.  It was a regular thieves' college.  A stranger who chanced into Driver's with a watch-chain upon him, or a chink of money in his pocket, or even a good coat on his back, might as soon think of coming out by the way he had entered as of flying.  There were ugly stories of murders and mysteries under those dark staircases, and even the police drew the line at Driver's Court, and gave it the go-by.  Jeffreys had nothing to apprehend as he rushed down the passage.  He had neither watch, chain, nor money, nor good coat.  His footsteps echoing noisily in the midnight silence brought a few heads to their windows, and almost before he stood in the court there was the cry of \"Fire!\"  Terrible anywhere, such a cry in a court like Driver's was terrible indeed.  In a moment the narrow pavement swarmed with people, shouting, cursing, and screaming.  Although even yet the flames scarcely appeared from below, a panic set in which it was hopeless either to remove or control.  Chairs, tables, mattresses were flung, it seemed at random, from the windows.  Mothers, not venturing out on the stairs, cried down to those below to catch their children.  Drunken men, suddenly roused, reeled fighting and blaspheming into the court.  Thieves plied their trade even on their panic-stricken neighbours, and fell to blows over the plunder.  Still more terrible was the cry to others who remained within.  Children, huddled into corners, heard that cry, and it glued them where they stood.  The sick and the crippled heard it, and made one last effort to rise and escape.  Even the aged and bedridden, deserted by all, when they heard it, lay shouting for some one to help.  The flames, pent-up at first and reddening the sky sullenly through the smoke, suddenly freed themselves and shot up in a wild sheet above the court.  The crowd below answered the outburst with a hideous chorus of shrieks and yells, and surged madly towards the doomed house.  There was no gleam of pity or devotion in those lurid, upturned faces. To many of them it was a show, a spectacle; to others a terrible nightmare, to others a cruel freak of Providence, calling forth curses.  The flames, spreading downwards, had already reached the second floor, when a window suddenly opened; and a woman with wild dishevelled hair, put out her head and screamed wildly.  The crowd caught sight of her, and answered with something like a jeer.  \"It's Black Sal,\" some one shouted; \"she's kotched it at last.\"  \"Why don't you jump?\" shouted another.  \"Booh?\" shouted a third.  \"Who skinned the cripple?\"  The woman gave a scared look up and down.  The flames at that moment wrapped round the window, and, with a wild howl, the crowd saw her disappear into the room.  Jeffreys all this time had been standing wedged in the crowd, a spectator of that hideous scene, and now a witness of this last tragedy.  With a desperate effort he fought his way to the front, hitting right and left to make himself a passage.  It was a minute before he got through.  Then the crowd, realising as if by intuition his purpose, staggered back, and raised a howl as he dashed into the door of the half-consumed building.  The first flight of steps was still intact, and he was up it in a moment; but as he dashed up the second the smoke whirled down in his face and half-choked him.  He groped--for it was impossible to see--in search of the door; and guided partly by the roar of the crowd without, and partly by the shrieks within, he found the room.  It was full of flame as he entered it, and to all appearance contained nothing else.  The wretched woman, finding the stairs worse to face than the window, had rushed back there and flung herself desperately onto the heads of the crowd below.  As he turned to save himself, Jeffreys, amid the roar of the flames, caught the sound of a shout from the corner of the room which he had imagined to be empty.  Rushing towards it, he caught sight of a figure of a lad on the floor, blackened with smoke, and evidently unable to move.  Yet he was not senseless, for he called, \"I can't walk--help me.\"  Jeffreys caught him in his arms in a moment, and only just in time.  He had literally to wade through flame to the door; and when he reached the stairs outside, the dense smoke, reddening every instant, burst upon him well-nigh overwhelmingly.  How he struggled down that awful flight with his burden he knew not. More than once he stumbled; and once a shower of fallen embers all but stunned him.  It was all done in a minute.  Those who watched without marvelled how soon he returned; and when they perceived that he bore in his arms a living creature, even Driver's Court swayed back to let him pass, and cheered him.  Happily a cry of \"Engines!\" at the other end of the court diverted the crowd still further, and enabled him to stagger forward clear of danger.  \"Drop him, he's a dead 'un!\" shouted some one who stopped a moment to peer into the face of the senseless lad.  \"I'll give you a shilling to help me with him out of this,\" said Jeffreys.  It was a shilling well spent.  Unaided he could never have done it, but with the sturdy gladiator to clear the way he was able at last to reach the comparative seclusion of Storr Alley.  The offer of another shilling prevailed on the man to carry the lad to the attic.  Then for the first time left to himself, he looked in the face of this unexpected guest.  And as he did so the room seemed to swim round him. He forgot where he was or what he was.  He looked down on an upturned face, but one not blackened with smoke.  It was white and livid, with green grass for a background--and the roar he heard was no longer the distant yell of a panic-stricken mob, but boys' voices--voices shouting at himself!  Yes, for the last time that vision rose before him.  Then with a mighty effort he shook off the dream and looked once more in the face of the boy who lay there on the floor of the Storr Alley garret. And as he did so young Forrester slowly opened his eyes.    CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.  COME BACK.  Raby had come home with a strange story from Storr Alley that afternoon. She was not much given to romance, but to her there was something pathetic about this man \"John\" and his unceremonious adoption of those orphan children.  She had not seen anything exactly like it, and it moved both her admiration and her curiosity.  She had heard much about \"John\" from the neighbours, and all she had heard had been of the right sort.  Jonah had talked bitterly of him now and then, but before he died he had acknowledged that John had been his only friend.  Little Annie had never mentioned him without a smile brightening her face; and even those who had complaints to pour out about everybody all round could find nothing to say about him.  Yet she seemed destined never to see him.  The next day, at her usual time, Raby turned her steps to Storr Alley. Groups of people stood about in the court, and it was evident, since she was last there, something untoward had happened.  A fireman's helmet at the other end of the alley, in the passage leading to Driver's Court, told its own tale; and if that was not enough, the smell of fire and the bundles of rags and broken furniture which blocked up the narrow pathway, were sufficient evidence.  The exiles from Driver's stared hard at the young lady as she made her way through the crowd; but the people of Storr Alley treated her as a friend, and she had no lack of information as to the calamity of the preceding night.  Raby paid several visits on her way up.  Then, with some trepidation, she knocked at the door of the garret.  There was no reply from within till she turned the handle, and said--  \"May I come in?\"  Then a voice replied,--  \"Yes, if you like,\" and she entered.  It was a strange scene which met her eyes as she did so.  A lad was stretched on the bed, awake, but, motionless, regarding with some anxiety a baby who slumbered, nestling close to his side.  On the floor, curled up, with his face to the wall, lay a man sleeping heavily; while Tim, divided in his interest between the stranger on the bed and the visitor at the door, stood like a little watchdog suddenly put on his guard.  \"May I come in?\" said Raby again timidly.  \"Here she is!\" cried Tim, running to her; \"John's asleep, and he,\"-- pointing to the figure on the bed--\"can't run about.\"  \"Correct, Timothy,\" said the youth referred to; \"I can't--hullo!\"  This last exclamation was caused by his catching sight of Raby at the door.  He had expected a lodger; but what was this apparition?  \"Please come in,\" said he, bewildered; \"it's a shocking room to ask you into, and--Timothy, introduce me to your friend.\"  Raby smiled; and how the crippled lad thought it brightened the room! \"Tim and I are friends,\" said she, lifting up the child to give him a kiss.  \"I'm afraid you are very badly hurt.  I heard of the fire as I came up.\"  \"No, I'm all right; I'm never very active.  In fact, I can only move my hands and my head, as Timothy says.  I can't run, I'm a cripple.  I shouldn't be anything if it wasn't for Jeff.  Hullo, Jeff! wake up, old man!\"  Raby started and turned pale as she raised her hand to prevent his waking the sleeper.  \"No, please, don't wake him; what did you say his name was?\"  \"Jeffreys--John Jeffreys--commonly called Jeff.  He hauled me out of the fire last night, and guessed as little at the time who I was as I guessed who he was.  I can't believe it yet.  It's like a--\"  \"You haven't told me your name,\" said Raby faintly.  \"Gerard Forrester, at your service.  Hullo, I say, are you ill?  Hi! Jeff, wake up, old man; you're wanted.\"  Raby had only time to sink on a chair and draw Tim to her when Jeffreys suddenly woke and rose to his feet.  \"What is it, Forrester, old fellow? anything wrong?\" said he, springing to the bedside.  \"I don't know what's the matter--look behind you.\"  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  \"Why did she cry?\" asked Tim presently, when she had gone.  \"I know; because of that ugly man,\" added he, pointing to Forrester.  \"Excuse me, young man, I have the reputation of being good-looking; that cannot have been the reason.  But, Jeff, I'm all in a dream.  Who is she? and how comes she to know you or me?  And, as Timothy pertinently remarks, `Whence these tears?'  Tell us all about it before the baby wakes.\"  Jeffreys told him.  The story was the history of his life since he had left Bolsover; and it took long to tell, for he passed over nothing.  \"Poor old man!\" said Forrester, when it was done; \"what a lot you have been through!\"  \"Have I not deserved it?  That day at Bolsover--\"  \"Oh, for goodness' sake, don't go back to that.  You know it was an accident, and what was not an accident was the fault of my own folly. That night I awoke and saw you standing at the door, I knew that you had already suffered as much as I had.\"  \"That was the last time I saw you.  You forget I have still to hear what happened to you afterwards.\"  \"It's pretty easily told.  But I say, Jeff, what did you say her name was?\"  \"Raby Atherton,\" said Jeffreys, smiling.  This was about the twentieth time the boy had broken in with some question about her.  \"She is the daughter of your guardian, Colonel Atherton, who was your father's comrade in Afghanistan.  Some day she will tell you the story of a battle out there which will make you proud of being Captain Forrester's son.  But I want to hear about you.\"  \"I was taken home to Grangerham, you know.  My grandmother was ill at the time, and just starting South, so I was left in charge of my old nurse.  She was an awful brick to me, was that old soul, and I don't believe I know yet all she did and put up with for me.  \"The doctors at Grangerham couldn't make anything of me.  One said I'd be cutting about again in a few weeks, and another said I'd be buried in a few days.  It's hard to decide when doctors disagree at that rate, and old Mary gave it up, and did what was the best thing--kept me quietly at home.  Of course we thought that my grandmother had written to my father, but she hadn't, so he can't have heard for ages.  We heard of my grandmother's death presently, and then made the pleasant discovery that she had died in debt, and that the furniture of the house was hired. That pulled Mary and me up short.  She had saved a little, and I believe she spent every penny of that to get me up to London to a hospital.  I didn't have a bad time of it there for a month or two.  I was considered an interesting case, and had all sorts of distinguished fellows to come and look at me, and I lived like a fighting-cock all the time.  I found, as long as I lay flat, and didn't get knocked about, I was really pretty comfortable, and what was more, I could use my hands.  That was no end of a blessing.  I had picked up a few ideas about drawing you know, at Bolsover, and found now that I could do pretty well at it.  I believe some of my sketches at the Middlesex were thought well of.  Mary came to see me nearly every day.  I could see she was getting poorer and poorer, and when at last I was discharged, the little rooms she took me to were about as poor as they could be to be respectable.  \"I'd hardly been back a week, when one day after going out to try to sell some of my sketches, she came home ill and died quite suddenly.  I was all up a tree then--no money, no friends, no legs.  I wrote to Frampton, but he can't have got my letter.  Then I got threatened with eviction, and all but left out in the street, when the person old Mary had sold my sketches to called round and ordered some more.  I didn't see him, but a brute of a woman who lived in the house did, and was cute enough to see she could make a good thing out of me.  So she took possession of me, and ever since then I've been a prisoner, cut off from the outside world as completely as if I had been in a dungeon, grinding out pictures by the dozen, and never seeing a farthing of what they fetched, except in the food which Black Sal provided to keep me alive. Now and then, in an amiable mood, she would get me a newspaper; and once I had to illustrate a cheap edition of Cook's _Voyages_, and of course had the book to go by.  But she never let me write to anybody or see anybody, and mounted guard over me as jealously as if I had been a veritable goose that laid golden eggs.  \"You know the rest.  We got turned out when they pulled down the old place, and took refuge in Driver's Alley, a nice select neighbourhood; and there you found me, old man.\"  \"Think of being near one another so long,\" said Jeffreys, \"and never knowing it.\"  \"Ten to one that's exactly what my guardian's daughter is observing to herself at this moment.  I say, Jeff, compared with Driver's Court, this is a palatial apartment, and you are a great improvement on Black Sal; but for ah that, don't you look forward to seeing a little civilisation--to eating with a fork, for instance, and hearing an `h' aspirated; and--oh, Jeff, it will be heavenly to wear a clean collar!\"  Jeffreys laughed.  \"Your two years' trouble haven't cast out the spirit of irreverence, youngster,\" said he.  \"It _is_ jolly to hear myself called youngster,\" said the boy, in a parenthesis; \"it reminds me of the good old days.\"  \"Before Bolsover?\" said Jeffreys sadly.  \"Look here!  If you go back to that again, and pull any more of those long faces, Jeff, I'll be angry with you.  Wasn't all that affair perhaps a blessing in the long run?  It sent me to a school that's done me more good than Bolsover; and as for you--well, but for it you'd never have had that sweet visitor this morning.\"  \"Don't talk of that.  That is one of the chief drawbacks to my going back into civilisation, as you call it.\"  \"A very nice drawback--if it's the only one--\"  \"It's not--there's another.\"  \"What is that?\"  \"My babies!\"  It was a strange, happy night, that last in the Storr Alley garret. Jeffreys had begged Raby to let them stay where they were in peace for that day; and she considerately kept their counsel till the morning. Then she told her father the strange story.  \"Two birds with one stone, and such a stone!\" ejaculated the bewildered colonel.  \"Four birds, father--there are two babies as well.\"  \"Whew!\" said the colonel, \"what a holiday I am having!\"  \"Poor father,\" said the girl, \"it's too bad!\"  \"Oh, well.  The more the merrier.  What's to be done now?  We'd better charter a coach and four and a brass band and go and fetch them home in state.  If they'd wait till to-morrow we would have up a triumphal arch too.\"  \"How frivolous you are, father!  We must get them away with as little fuss as possible.  I arranged with Mr Jeffreys that he would bring Mr Forrester here in a cab this morning.\"  \"And the babies?\"  \"He will go back for them afterwards.\"  \"Well, as you like; but what about Percy and the Rimbolts?\"  \"Percy was to go out of town to-day, you know, and will not be back till to-morrow.  By that time we shall be able to find out what Mr Jeffreys would like best.\"  \"Oh, very good.  We'll wait till his royal highness signifies his pleasure, and meanwhile our relatives and friends must be avoided-- that's what you mean.\"  \"No,\" said Raby, colouring; \"but you know how easily frightened he is.\"  The colonel laughed pleasantly.  \"All right, Raby; they shall be let down as easily as you like.  Now shall I be in the way when they come, or shall I make myself scarce? And, by the way, I must go at once and get a perambulator, and feeding- bottles, and all that sort of thing.  How many times a day am I to be sent out to take them walks?\"  \"You're too silly for anything,\" said Raby dutifully.  She was grateful to him for making things so easy, and for covering her own ill-disguised embarrassment by this adroit show of frivolity.  There was no frivolity in the manner in which the gallant soldier welcomed his old comrade's son, when an hour later he entered the house, borne in the strong arms of his friend.  A couch was ready for him, and everything was made as simple and homelike as possible.  Jeffreys stayed long enough to help the boy into the civilised garments provided for him, and then quietly betook himself once more to Storr Alley.  The curiosity roused by the departure of `Black Sal's Forrester' in a cab was redoubled when, late that afternoon, Jeffreys was seen walking out of the alley with the baby in one arm and Tim holding onto the other.  He had considered it best to make no public announcement of his departure.  If he had, he might have found it more difficult than it was to take the important step.  As it was, he had to run a gauntlet of a score of inquisitive idlers, who were by no means satisfied with the assurance that he was going to give the children an airing.  The general opinion seemed to be that he was about to take the children to the workhouse, and a good deal of odium was worked up in consequence. Some went so far as to say he was going to sell or drown the infants; and others, Driver's Alley refugees, promised him a warm reception if he returned without them!  He neither returned with nor without them.  They saw him no more.  But it was given to the respectable inhabitants of a crescent near Regent's Park, about half an hour later, to witness the strange spectacle of a big young man, carrying a small baby in his arms and a big one on his shoulder--for Tim had turned restive on his hands-- walk solemnly along the footpath till he reached the door of Colonel Atherton's, where he rang.  The colonel and Raby had a queer tea-party that evening.  When the meal was ended, Jeffreys was called upon to put his infants to bed, and a wonderful experience to those small mortals was the warm bath and the feather-bed to which they were severally introduced.  Jeffreys was thankful that the baby was restless, and gave him an excuse for remaining in retirement most of the evening.  At length, however, silence reigned; and he had no further excuse.  Entering the parlour, he perceived almost with a shock that Mr Rimbolt was there.  He had called in accidentally, and had just been told the news.  \"My dear fellow,\" said he, as he took his old librarian's hand, \"how we have longed for this day!\"  Raby and her father were occupied with Forrester, and Jeffreys and his old employer were left undisturbed.  What they talked about I need not repeat.  It chiefly had reference to Storr Alley and to Percy.  \"He is down at Watford seeing a friend to-night.  We expect him back to- morrow morning.  How happy he will be!  By the way,\" added Mr Rimbolt, a moment afterwards, \"now I remember, there is a train leaves Euston for Overstone at 12:30, half an hour after Percy's train comes in.  How should you like to meet him, and run down with him for a week or two to Wildtree?  He sadly wants a change, and my books sadly want looking after there.  You will have the place to yourselves, but perhaps you won't mind that.\"  Jeffreys flushed with pleasure at the proposal.  It was the very programme he would have selected.  But for a moment his face clouded, as he glanced towards Forrester.  \"I don't know whether I ought to leave him?\"  \"He is with his guardian, you know, and could not be in better quarters.\"  \"Then--you know I have--that is, you know--there are two--babies.\"  Raby, however, when the question was subsequently discussed, expressed herself fully equal to the care of these promising infants until a home could be found for them; and Forrester, for his part, declared that Jeffreys must and should go to Wildtree.  \"Can't you see I don't want you any more?\" said he.  \"This sofa's so comfortable, I'm certain I shall sleep a fortnight straight away, and then my guardian and I have no end of business to talk over, haven't we, guardian? and you'd really be in the way.\"  So it was settled.  The whole party retired early to bed after their exciting day.  Jeffreys slept for the last time between the babies, and could scarcely believe, when he awoke, that he was not still in Storr Alley.  Still less could Tim when he awoke realise where he was.  For the John he was accustomed to stood no longer in his weather-beaten, tattered garments, but in the respectable librarian's suit which he had left behind him at Clarges Street, and which now, by some mysterious agency, found itself transferred to his present room.  Tim resented the change, and bellowed vehemently for the space of an hour, being joined at intervals by his younger brother, and egged on by the mocking laughter of young Forrester, who was enjoying the exhibition from the adjoining chamber.  For once Jeffreys could do nothing with his disorderly infants, and was compelled finally to carry them down one under each arm, to the sitting- room, where Raby came to the rescue, and thus established her claim on their allegiance for a week or so to come.  In a strange turmoil of feelings Jeffreys at mid-day walked to Euston. Mr Rimbolt was there with Percy's travelling bag and the tickets, but he did not remain till the train from Watford came in.  \"I may be running down to the North myself in about a fortnight,\" said he, as he bade good-bye; \"we can leave business till then--good-bye.\"  The train came in at last.  Jeffreys could see the boy pacing in a nonchalant way down the platform, evidently expecting anything but this meeting.  His eyes seemed by some strange perversity even to avoid the figure which stood waiting for him; nor was it till Jeffreys quietly stepped in front of him, and said \"Percy,\" that they took him in and blazed forth a delighted recognition.  \"Jeff,\" he said, \"you've come back--really?\"  \"Yes, really.\"  \"To stay--for good?\"  \"For good--old fellow.\"  Percy heaved a sight of mighty content as he slipped his arm into that of his friend.  And half an hour later the two were whizzing northwards on their way to Wildtree, with their troubles all behind them.    CHAPTER TWENTY NINE.  A FRESH START.  It is supposed to be the duty of every well-conducted author, after the curtain has fallen on the final tableau of his little drama, to lift it, or half lift it, for a momentary last glimpse at the principal actors.  I am not quite sure whether this is not an encouragement to laziness on the part of the reader.  In most respects he is as well able to picture the future of Jeffreys, and Raby, and Percy, and Tim as I am.  I cannot show them to you in all the dignity of an honoured old age, because they are only a year or two older to-day than they were when Percy and Jeffreys took that little run together down to Cumberland. Nor can I show them to you, after the fashion of a fairy tale, \"married and living happily ever afterwards,\" because when I met Jeffreys in the Strand the other day, he told me that although he had just been appointed to the control of a great public library in the North, it would still be some months, possibly a year, before he would be able to set up house on his own account.  However, he seemed contented on the whole to wait a bit; and in a long talk we had as we walked up and down the Embankment I heard a good many scraps of information which made it possible to satisfy the reader on one or two points about which he may still be anxious.  Jeffreys and Percy stayed at Wildtree for a month, and the time was one of the happiest both of them ever spent.  They did nothing exciting. They read some Aristophanes, and added some new \"dodge\" to their wonderful automatic bookcase.  They went up Wild Pike one bright winter's day and had a glorious view from the top.  And on the ledge coming back they sat and rested awhile on a spot they both remembered well.  Julius's grave was not forgotten when they reached the valley below; and the \"J\" upon the stone which marks the place to this day was their joint work for an hour that afternoon.  As for the books, Jeffreys had sprung towards them on his first arrival as a father springs towards his long-lost family.  They were sadly in want of dusting and arranging, as for a month or two no one had been near them.  On the floor lay the parcels, just as they had arrived from the sale in Exeter; and altogether Jeffreys had work enough to keep him busy, not for one month only, but for several.  He was not sorry to be busy.  For amid all the happiness and comforts of his new return to life he had many cares on his mind.  There was Forrester.  He had imagined that if he could only find him, all would be right, the past would be cancelled and his bad name would never again trouble him.  But as he thought of the helpless cripple, lying there unable to move without assistance, with all his prospects blighted and his very life a burden to him, he began to realise that the past was not cancelled, that he had a life's debt yet to pay, and a life's wrong for which, as far as possible, to make amends.  But he bravely faced his duty.  Forrester's letters, which came frequently, certainly did not much encourage melancholy reflections.  \"I'm in clover here,\" the boy wrote about a week after Jeffreys had gone North.  \"One would think I'd done something awfully fine.  My guardian is a trump--and is ever tired of telling me about my father.  Do you know I'm to have a pension from a grateful country?  What wouldn't Black Sal say to get hold of me now?  What I value quite as much is his sword, which I keep by my couch like a Knight Templar.  So mind what you're up to when you come back.  \"Here am I writing about myself, when I know you are longing to hear about (turn over-leaf and hide your blushes)--the babies!  They are tip- top.  Timothy, ever since I got my sword, has shown great respect for me, and sits on the pillow while I sketch.  By the way, do you recognise enclosed portrait?  It's my first attempt at a face--rather a pleasant face too, eh?  Oh, about the babies.  The young 'un's cut a tooth.  The whole house has been agitated in consequence, and the colonel is as proud as if he'd captured a province.  So are we all.  They are to go to an orphanage, I believe, in a week or two; but not till you come back and give your parental benediction.  My guardian is going to write you all about it.  He promises military openings for both when they arrive at the proper age; and Tim is practising already on a drum which _she_ has given him.  \"She, by the way, never mentions you, which is an excellent sign, but rather rough on me when I want to talk about you.  She occasionally is drawn out to talk about a certain Mr John at Storr Alley; but, as you know, she only knew about him from hearsay.  How's that boy who has got hold of you down in Cumberland?  Are he and I to be friends or enemies? Tell him I'm game for either, and give him choice of weapons if the latter.  But as long as he lets me see you now and then and treats you well, we may as well be friends.  I'm flourishing and awfully in love. Stay away as long as you can; you're not wanted here.  The lady of Clarges Street came to see me yesterday.  She sent you really a kind message; so even in that quarter you may yet look for a friend.  Good- bye--remember me to that chap.  Tim sends his duty; and _she_ when I mentioned I was writing to you and asked if there was any message, did not hear what I said.--G.F.\"  There was plenty in this bright letter to give comfort to Jeffreys.  He rejoiced humbly in its affectionate tone towards himself.  He treasured the portrait.  He was gratified at the unenvious references to Percy, and he was relieved at the prospect before his babies.  The part that referred to Raby left him less room for jubilation. Forrester evidently thought, as Percy did, that in that quarter everything was plain sailing.  They neither of them realised the gulf between the two, and they neither of them knew of that miserable October afternoon in Regent's Park.  Forrester's jocular reference to Raby's silence and reserve seemed to Jeffreys but a confirmation of what he believed to be the truth.  He was to her what any other friend in distress might be, an object of sweet pity and solicitude.  But that was all.  He had a bad name, and much as she would brave for him to help him, she did not--how could she?--love him.  At the end of a month Mr Rimbolt wrote to say he was coming down to Wildtree, and would be glad if Percy and Jeffreys would meet him with the carriage at Overstone.  They did so, and found that he was not alone.  Mr Halgrove stepped pleasantly out of the train at the same time and greeted his quondam ward with characteristic ease.  \"Ah, Jeffreys--here we are again.  I'm always meeting you at odd places. How fresh everything looks after the rain!\"  \"Mr Halgrove is my brother-in-law, you know, Jeffreys,\" said Mr Rimbolt, in response to his librarian's blank look of consternation.  \"I brought him down, as he wanted to see you and have a talk.  If you two would like to walk,\" added he, \"Percy and I will drive on, and have dinner ready by the time you arrive.\"  \"Good-hearted fellow, Rimbolt,\" said Mr Halgrove, as they started to walk, \"he always was.  That's Wild Pike, I suppose?\"  \"Yes,\" said Jeffreys, greatly puzzled at this unexpected meeting.  \"Yes, Rimbolt's a good fellow; and doesn't mind telling bad fellows that they aren't.  You'll smile, Jeffreys; but he has actually made me uncomfortable sometimes.\"  \"Really?\" said Jeffreys, thinking it must have been some very remarkable effort which succeeded in accomplishing, that wonder.  \"Yes.  I told him once casually about an unpleasant ward I once had, whom I rather disliked.  I thought he would sympathise with me when I related how delicately I had got rid of him and sent him adrift when it did not suit me to keep him any longer.  Would you believe it, Rimbolt wasn't at all sympathetic, but asked what had become of my ward's money! Do take warning, Jeffreys, and avoid the bad habit of asking inconvenient questions.  You have no idea of the pain they may cause. Mr Rimbolt's question pained me excessively.  Because my ward's money, like himself, had gone to the bad.  That would not have been of much consequence, were it not that I was responsible for its going to the bad.  It was most inconvenient altogether, I assure you.  It made me feel as if I had behaved not quite well in the matter; and you know how depressing such a feeling would be.  Still more inconvenient at the time when I had this talk with Rimbolt about six months ago, I had just come back from America with my finances in not at all a flourishing condition, so that if even I had been disposed to refund my ward, I could not have done it.  Happily he was lost.  It was an immense relief to me, I can assure you.  \"Two months ago my finances looked up.  I had news that some of my Yankee speculations were turning out well, and I unexpectedly found myself a man of means again.  Rimbolt, who certainly has the knack of making ill-timed suggestions, proposed that that would be a good opportunity for making good what properly belonged to my ward.  I urged in vain that my ward was lost, and that the money properly belonged to me as a reward for the trouble I had had in the matter.  He actually insisted that I should deposit with him, as trustee for my ward, the full amount of what belonged to him, with interest added to date, promising if by any unfortunate accident the fellow should be found, to see it came into his hands.  One's obliged to humour Rimbolt, so I did what he wanted, and that's how it stands.  If ever this unprofitable ward turns up, he'd better keep his eye on Rimbolt.  \"There, you see, Jeffreys, that's just a little anecdote to show you how easy it is, by being inconsiderate, for one person to make another uncomfortable.  But now tell me how you like Cumberland.  You must be quite a mountaineer by this time.\"  Jeffreys admitted he was pretty good, and had the tact to suit his humour to that of his guardian, and not refer further to the lost ward or his money.  Mr Halgrove stayed two days, and then departed for the Great West, where it is possible he may to-day carry a lighter heart about with him for his latest act of reparation.  Before the trio at Wildtree returned to London, Jeffreys, greatly to Percy's terror, asked leave to go for two days to York.  The boy seemed still not quite sure that he had got back his friend for good, and highly disapproved now of putting the temptation to \"bolt again,\" as he called it, in his way.  However, Jeffreys \"entered into recognisances\" to come back, and even offered to take Percy with him on his journey. The offer was not accepted, for Percy knew Jeffreys would sooner go alone.  But it allayed the boy's uneasiness.  Jeffreys had much trouble to discover Mrs Trimble.  Galloway House was still an educational establishment, but its present conductor knew nothing of the lady whose \"goodwill and connection\" he had purchased so cheaply two years ago.  Finally Jeffreys decided to call at Ash Cottage.  The walk up that familiar lane recalled many a strange memory.  The bank whereon he had sat that eventful early morning was unchanged, and had lost all traces of Jonah's excavations.  The railway embankment he had half thought of helping to construct was already overgrown with grass, and thundered under the weight of trains every few minutes.  Ash Cottage had not changed a plank or a tile since he last saw it. There were the same cracks in the wall of the shed, the same bushes on either side of the gate--nay, he was sure those wisps of hay clinging to the branches of the holly had been there two years ago.  As he walked somewhat doubtfully towards the house--for he could hardly forget under what circumstances he had last seen Farmer Rosher--he heard a boy's shout behind him, and looking round, perceived Freddy and Teddy giving chase.  \"It _is_ Jeff!\" shouted Freddy.  \"I knew him a mile away.\"  \"I saw him first.  We knew you'd come back, Jeff; huzzah!\"  \"That tricycle wants looking to awful bad.  Our feet touch the ground on it now, Jeff.\"  \"Come on to the shed, I say, and put it right.  _How_ brickish of you to come back, Jeff!\"  A long afternoon the happy Jeff spent over that intractable tricycle. It was past all repair; but no feat of engineering was ever applauded as were the one or two touches by which he contrived to make it stand upright and bear the weight of a boy.  Before the work was over Farmer Rosher had joined them, well pleased at his boys' delight.  \"Thee's paid oop for thy sin, lad,\" said he.  \"I did thee and the lads more harm than I meant; but thee's a home here whenever thee likes, to make up for it; and come away and see the missus and have a drop of tea.\"  From the farmer, who may have had good reason for knowing, Jeffreys learned that Mrs Trimble was comfortably quartered in an almshouse; and there, next morning--for there was do escaping from Ash Cottage that night--he found her, and soothed her with the news he had to tell of her poor prodigal.  \"Well, well,\" she said, \"God is merciful; and He will reward you, John, as He had pity on the lad.  And now will you be sure and take a mother's blessing to the sweet lady, and tell her if she ever wants to make an old woman happy, he has only to come here, and let me see her and kiss her for what she has done for me and mine?\"  That message he delivered a week later as he walked with Raby one afternoon in Regent's Park.  It was not exactly a chance walk.  They had both been up to the orphanage at Hampstead with the reluctant Tim and his brother, to leave them there in good motherly hands till the troubles of infancy should be safely passed.  It was Tim who had insisted on having the escort of both his natural guardians on the occasion; and at such a time and on such an errand Tim's word was law.  So they had gone all four in a cab, and now Raby and Jeffreys returned, and with a sense of bereavement, through the Park.  \"I will certainly go and see Mrs Trimble when next I am North,\" said Raby, \"though I wish I deserved half her gratitude.\"  \"You deserve it all.  You were an angel of light to that poor fellow.\"  They walked on some way in silence.  Then she said--  \"Storr Alley is so different now, Mr Jeffreys.  A family of seven is in your garret.  You would hardly know the place.\"  \"It would be strange indeed if I did not, for I too saw light there.\"  \"How wonderful it all was!\" said Raby.  \"When Jonah was telling me about his good protector, John, how little I dreamed it was you!\"  \"And when you wrote this little letter,\" said he, showing her the precious scrap of paper, \"how little you dreamed who would bless you for it!\"  \"The blessing belonged, did it not, to Him Who has been leading us all, in mercy, in His own way?\"  Again they walked in silence.  Was it accident, or what, which brought them, without knowing it, to a spot which to each was full of painful memories?  Raby was the first to stop abruptly.  \"Let us go another way, Mr Jeffreys, if you don't mind.  I don't like this avenue.\"  \"No more do I,\" said Jeffreys, who had stopped too.  \"Why?\" she asked.  \"Need I say?\"  \"Not if you don't like.\"  \"I have not walked down here since an afternoon last October.  There was a sudden storm of rain--\"  \"What!  Were you here then?\"  \"I was.  You did not see me.\"  \"You saw me then.  I was with Mr Scarfe.\"  \"Yes.  You were--\"  \"Miserable and angry,\" said she, her face kindling at the recollection.  He darted one glance at her, as brief as that he had darted on the afternoon of which they spoke.  Then, he had read nothing but despair for himself; now, though her eyes were downcast and her voice angry, he thought he read hope.  \"Suppose,\" said he, in a little while, \"instead of running away from the path, we just walk down it together.  Would you mind?  Are you afraid?\"  \"No,\" she said, smiling.  And they walked on.  THE END.\n\n"

In this tale I have left the battlefields of history, and have written a story of adventure in Australia, in the early days when the bush rangers and the natives constituted a real and formidable danger to the settlers. I have done this, not with the intention of extending your knowledge, or even of pointing a moral, although the story is not without one; but simply for a change--a change both for you and myself, but frankly, more for myself than for you. You know the old story of the boy who bothered his brains with Euclid, until he came to dream regularly that he was an equilateral triangle enclosed in a circle. Well, I feel that unless I break away sometimes from history, I shall be haunted day and night by visions of men in armour, and soldiers of all ages and times.  If, when I am away on a holiday I come across the ruins of a castle, I find myself at once wondering how it could best have been attacked, and defended. If I stroll down to the Thames, I begin to plan schemes of crossing it in the face of an enemy; and if matters go on, who can say but that I may find myself, some day, arrested on the charge of surreptitiously entering the Tower of London, or effecting an escalade of the keep of Windsor Castle! To avoid such a misfortune--which would entail a total cessation of my stories, for a term of years--I have turned to a new subject, which I can only hope that you will find as interesting, if not as instructive, as the other books which I have written.  G. A. Henty.    Chapter 1: The Broken Window.   \"You are the most troublesome boy in the village, Reuben Whitney, and you will come to a bad end.\"  The words followed a shower of cuts with the cane. The speaker was an elderly man, the master of the village school of Tipping, near Lewes, in Sussex; and the words were elicited, in no small degree, by the vexation of the speaker at his inability to wring a cry from the boy whom he was striking. He was a lad of some thirteen years of age, with a face naturally bright and intelligent; but at present quivering with anger.  \"I don't care if I do,\" he said defiantly. \"It won't be my fault, but yours, and the rest of them.\"  \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\" the master said, \"instead of speaking in that way. You, who learn easier than anyone here, and could always be at the top of your class, if you chose. I had hoped better things of you, Reuben; but it's just the way, it's your bright boys as mostly gets into mischief.\"  At this moment the door of the school room opened, and a lady with two girls, one of about fourteen and the other eleven years of age, entered.  \"What is the matter now?\" the lady asked, seeing the schoolmaster, cane in hand, and the boy standing before him.  \"Reuben Whitney! What, in trouble again, Reuben? I am afraid you are a very troublesome boy.\"  \"I am not troublesome, ma'm,\" the boy said sturdily. \"That is, I wouldn't be if they would let me alone; but everything that is done bad, they put it down to me.\"  \"But what have you been doing now, Reuben?\"  \"I have done nothing at all, ma'm; but he's always down on me,\" and he pointed to the master, \"and when they are always down on a fellow, it's no use his trying to do right.\"  \"What has the boy been doing now, Mr. White?\" the lady asked.  \"Look there, ma'm, at those four windows all smashed, and the squire had all the broken panes mended only a fortnight ago.\"  \"How was it done, Mr. White?\"  \"By a big stone, ma'm, which caught the frame where they joined, and smashed them all.\"  \"I did not do it, Mrs. Ellison, indeed I didn't.\"  \"Why do you suppose it was Reuben?\" Mrs. Ellison asked the master.  \"Because I had kept him in, half an hour after the others went home to dinner, for pinching young Jones and making him call out; and he had only just gone out of the gate when I heard the smash; so there is no doubt about it, for all the others must have been in at their dinner at that time.\"  \"I didn't do it, ma'm,\" the boy repeated. \"Directly I got out of the gate, I started off to run home. I hadn't gone not twenty yards when I heard a smash; but I wasn't going for to stop to see what it was. It weren't no business of mine, and that's all I know about it.\"  \"Mamma,\" the younger of the two girls said eagerly, \"what he says is quite true. You know you let me run down the village with the jelly for Mrs. Thomson's child, and as I was coming down the road I saw a boy come out of the gate of the school and run away; and then I heard a noise of broken glass, and I saw another boy jump over the hedge opposite, and run, too. He came my way and, directly he saw me, he ran to a gate and climbed over.\"  \"Do you know who it was, Kate?\" Mrs. Ellison asked.  \"Yes, mamma. It was Tom Thorne.\"  \"Is Thomas Thorne here?\" Mrs. Ellison asked in a loud voice.  There was a general turning of the heads of the children to the point where a boy, somewhat bigger than the rest, had been apparently studying his lessons with great diligence.  \"Come here, Tom Thorne,\" Mrs. Ellison said.  The boy slouched up with a sullen face.  \"You hear what my daughter says, Tom. What have you to say in reply?\"  \"I didn't throw the stone at the window,\" the boy replied. \"I chucked it at a sparrow, and it weren't my fault if it missed him and broke the window.\"  \"I should say it was your fault, Tom,\" Mrs. Ellison said sharply--\"very much your fault, if you throw a great stone at a bird without taking care to see what it may hit. But that is nothing to your fault in letting another boy be punished for what you did. I shall report the matter to the squire, and he will speak to your father about it. You are a wicked, bad boy.  \"Mr. White, I will speak to you outside.\"  Followed by her daughters, Mrs. Ellison went out; Kate giving a little nod, in reply to the grateful look that Reuben Whitney cast towards her, and his muttered:  \"Thank you, miss.\"  \"Walk on, my dears,\" Mrs. Ellison said. \"I will overtake you, in a minute or two.  \"This will not do, Mr. White,\" she said, when she was alone with the master. \"I have told you before that I did not approve of your thrashing so much, and now it is proved that you punish without any sufficient cause, and upon suspicion only. I shall report the case at once to the squire and, unless I am greatly mistaken, you will have to look out for another place.\"  \"I am very sorry, Mrs. Ellison, indeed I am; and it is not often I use the cane, now. If it had been anyone else, I might have believed him; but Reuben Whitney is always in mischief.\"  \"No wonder he is in mischief,\" the lady said severely, \"if he is punished, without a hearing, for all the misdeeds of others. Well, I shall leave the matter in the squire's hands; but I am sure he will no more approve than I do of the children being ill treated.\"  Reuben Whitney was the son of a miller, near Tipping. John Whitney had been considered a well-to-do man, but he had speculated in corn and had got into difficulties; and his body was, one day, found floating in the mill dam. No one knew whether it was the result of intention or accident, but the jury of his neighbours who sat upon the inquest gave him the benefit of the doubt, and brought in a verdict of \"accidental death.\" He was but tenant of the mill and, when all the creditors were satisfied, there were only a few pounds remaining for the widow.  With these she opened a little shop in Tipping, with a miscellaneous collection of tinware and cheap ironmongery; cottons, tapes, and small articles of haberdashery; with toys, sweets, and cakes for the children. The profits were small, but the squire, who had known her husband, charged but a nominal rent for the cottage; and this was more than paid by the fruit trees in the garden, which also supplied her with potatoes and vegetables, so that she managed to support her boy and herself in tolerable comfort.  She herself had been the daughter of a tradesman in Lewes, and many wondered that she did not return to her father, upon her husband's death. But her home had not been a comfortable one, before her marriage; for her father had taken a second wife, and she did not get on well with her stepmother. She thought, therefore, that anything would be better than returning with her boy to a home where, to the mistress at least, she would be most unwelcome.  She had, as a girl, received an education which raised her somewhat above the other villagers of Tipping; and of an evening she was in the habit of helping Reuben with his lessons, and trying to correct the broadness of dialect which he picked up from the other boys. She was an active and bustling woman, managed her little shop well, and kept the garden, with Reuben's assistance, in excellent order.  Mrs. Ellison had, at her first arrival in the village three years before, done much to give her a good start, by ordering that all articles of use for the house, in which she dealt, should be purchased of her; and she highly approved of the energy and independence of the young widow. But lately there had been an estrangement between the squire's wife and the village shopkeeper. Mrs. Ellison, whose husband owned all the houses in the village, as well as the land surrounding it, was accustomed to speak her mind very freely to the wives of the villagers. She was kindness itself, in cases of illness or distress; and her kitchen supplied soups, jellies, and nourishing food to all who required it; but in return, Mrs. Ellison expected her lectures on waste, untidiness, and mismanagement to be listened to with respect and reverence.  She was, then, at once surprised and displeased when, two or three months before, having spoken sharply to Mrs. Whitney as to the alleged delinquencies of Reuben, she found herself decidedly, though not disrespectfully, replied to.  \"The other boys are always set against my Reuben,\" Mrs. Whitney said, \"because he is a stranger in the village, and has no father; and whatever is done, they throw it on to him. The boy is not a bad boy, ma'm--not in any way a bad boy. He may get into mischief, like the rest; but he is not a bit worse than others, not half as bad as some of them, and those who have told you that he is haven't told you the truth.\"  Mrs. Ellison had not liked it. She was not accustomed to be answered, except by excuses and apologies; and Mrs. Whitney's independent manner of speaking came upon her almost as an act of rebellion, in her own kingdom. She was too fair, however, to withdraw her custom from the shop; but from that time she had not, herself, entered it.  Reuben was a source of anxiety to his mother, but this had no reference to his conduct. She worried over his future. The receipts from the shop were sufficient for their wants; and indeed the widow was enabled, from time to time, to lay by a pound against bad times; but she did not see what she was to do with the boy. Almost all the other lads of the village, of the same age, were already in the fields; and Mrs. Whitney felt that she could not much longer keep him idle. The question was, what was she to do with him? That he should not go into the fields she was fully determined, and her great wish was to apprentice him to some trade; but as her father had recently died, she did not see how she was to set about it.  That evening, at dinner, Mrs. Ellison told the squire of the scene in the school room.  \"White must go,\" he said, \"that is quite evident. I have seen, for some time, that we wanted a younger man, more abreast of the times than White is; but I don't like turning him adrift altogether. He has been here upwards of thirty years. What am I to do with him?\"  Mrs. Ellison could make no suggestion; but she, too, disliked the thought of anyone in the village being turned adrift upon the world.  \"The very thing!\" the squire exclaimed, suddenly. \"We will make him clerk. Old Peters has long been past his work. The old man must be seventy-five, if he's a day, and his voice quavers so that it makes the boys laugh. We will pension him off. He can have his cottage rent free, and three or four shillings a week. I don't suppose it will be for many years. As for White, he cannot be much above sixty. He will fill the place very well.  \"I am sure the vicar will agree, for he has been speaking to me, about Peters being past his work, for the last five years. What do you say, my dear?\"  \"I think that will do very well, William,\" Mrs. Ellison replied, \"and will get over the difficulty altogether.\"  \"So you see, wife, for once that boy of Widow Whitney's was not to blame. I told you you took those stories on trust against him too readily. The boy's a bit of a pickle, no doubt; and I very near gave him a thrashing, myself, a fortnight since, for on going up to the seven-acre field, I found him riding bare backed on that young pony I intended for Kate.\"  \"You don't say so, William!\" Mrs. Ellison exclaimed, greatly shocked. \"I never heard of such an impudent thing. I really wonder you didn't thrash him.\"  \"Well, perhaps I should have done so, my dear; but the fact is, I caught sight of him some time before he saw me, and he was really sitting her so well that I could not find it in my heart to call out. He was really doing me a service. The pony had never been ridden, and was as wild as a wild goat. Thomas is too old, in fact, to break it in, and I should have had to get someone to do it, and pay him two or three pounds for the job.  \"It was not the first time the boy had been on her back, I could see. The pony was not quite broken and, just as I came on the scene, was trying its best to get rid of him; but it couldn't do it, and I could see, by the way he rode her about afterwards, that he had got her completely in hand; and a very pretty-going little thing she will turn out.\"  \"But what did you say to him, William? I am sure I should never stop to think whether he was breaking in the pony, or not, if I saw him riding it about.\"  \"I daresay not, my dear,\" the squire said, laughing; \"but then you see, you have never been a boy; and I have, and can make allowances. Many a pony and horse have I broken in, in my time; and have got on the back of more than one, without my father knowing anything about it.\"  \"Yes, but they were your father's horses, William,\" Mrs. Ellison persisted. \"That makes all the difference.\"  \"I don't suppose it would have made much difference to me,\" the squire laughed, \"at that time. I was too fond of horse flesh, even from a boy, to be particular whose horse it was I got across. However, of course, after waiting till he had done, I gave the young scamp a blowing up.\"  \"Not much of a blowing up, I am sure,\" Mrs. Ellison said; \"and as likely as not, a shilling at the end of it.\"  \"Well, Mary, I must own,\" the squire said pleasantly, \"that a shilling did find its way out of my pocket into his.\"  \"It's too bad of you, William,\" Mrs. Ellison said indignantly. \"Here is this boy, who is notoriously a scapegrace, has the impertinence to ride your horse, and you encourage him in his misdeeds by giving him a shilling.\"  \"Well, my dear, don't you see, I saved two pounds nineteen by the transaction.  \"Besides,\" he added more seriously, \"I think the boy has been maligned. I don't fancy he's a bad lad at all. A little mischief and so on, but none the worse for that. Besides, you know, I knew his father; and have sat many a time on horseback chatting to him, at the door of his mill; and drank more than one glass of good ale, which his wife has brought out to me. I am not altogether easy in my conscience about them. If there had been a subscription got up for the widow at his death, I should have put my name down for twenty pounds; and all that I have done for her is to take eighteen pence a week off that cottage of theirs.  \"No, I called the boy to me when he got off, and pretty scared he looked when he saw me. When he came up, I asked him how he dared to ride my horses about, without my leave. Of course he said he was sorry, which meant nothing; and he added, as a sort of excuse, that he used from a child to ride the horses at the mill down to the ford for water; and that his father generally had a young one or two, in that paddock of his by the mill, and he used often to ride them; and seeing the pony one day, galloping about the field and kicking up its heels, he wondered whether he could sit a horse still, and especially whether he could keep on that pony's back. Then he set to, to try.  \"The pony flung him several times, at first; and no wonder, as he had no saddle, and only a piece of old rope for a bridle; but he mastered him at last, and he assured me that he had never used the stick, and certainly he had not one when I saw him. I told him, of course, that he knew he ought not to have done it; but that, as he had taken it in hand, he might finish it. I said that I intended to have it broken in for Kate, and that he had best get a bit of sacking and put it on sideways, to accustom the pony to carry a lady. Then I gave him a shilling, and told him I would give him five more, when he could tell me the pony was sufficiently broken and gentle to carry Kate.\"  Mrs. Ellison shook her head in disapprobation.  \"It is of no use, William, my talking to the villagers as to the ways of their boys, if that is the way you counteract my advice.\"  \"But I don't always, my dear,\" the squire said blandly. \"For instance, I shall go round tomorrow morning with my dog whip to Thorne's; and I shall offer him the choice of giving that boy of his the soundest thrashing he ever had, while I stand by to see it, or of going out of his house at the end of the quarter.  \"I rather hope he will choose the latter alternative. That beer shop of his is the haunt of all the idle fellows in the village. I have a strong suspicion that he is in league with the poachers, if he doesn't poach himself; and the first opportunity I get of laying my finger upon him, out he goes.\"  A few days later when Kate Ellison issued from the gate of the house, which lay just at the end of the village, with the basket containing some jelly and medicine for a sick child, she found Reuben Whitney awaiting her. He touched his cap.  \"Please, miss, I made bold to come here, to thank you for having cleared me.\"  \"But I couldn't help clearing you, Reuben, for you see, I knew it wasn't you.\"  \"Well, miss, it was very kind, all the same; and I am very much obliged to you.\"  \"But why do you get into scrapes?\" the girl said. \"If you didn't, you wouldn't be suspected of other things. Mamma said, the other day, you got into more scrapes than any boy in the village; and you look nice, too. Why do you do it?\"  \"I don't know why I do it, miss,\" Reuben said shamefacedly. \"I suppose it's because I don't go into the fields, like most of the other boys; and haven't got much to do. But there's no great harm in them, miss. They are just larks, nothing worse.\"  \"You don't do really bad things?\" the girl asked.  \"No, miss, I hope not.\"  \"And you don't tell stories, do you?\"  \"No, miss, never. If I do anything and I am asked, I always own it. I wouldn't tell a lie to save myself from a licking.\"  \"That's right,\" the girl said graciously.  She caught somewhat of her mother's manner, from going about with her to the cottages; and it seemed quite natural, to her, to give her advice to this village scapegrace.  \"Well, try not to do these sort of things again, Reuben; because I like you, and I don't like to hear people say you are the worst boy in the village, and I don't think you are. Good-bye,\" and Kate Ellison proceeded on her way.  Reuben smiled as he looked after her. Owing to his memory of his former position at the mill, and to his mother's talk and teaching, Reuben did not entertain the same feeling of respect, mingled with fear, for the squire's family which was felt by the village in general. Instead of being two years younger than himself, the girl had spoken as gravely as if she had been twenty years his senior, and Reuben could not help a smile of amusement.  \"She is a dear little lady,\" he said, as he looked after her; \"and it's only natural she should talk like her mother. But Mrs. Ellison means well, too, mother says; and as for the squire, he is a good fellow. I expected he would have given it to me the other day.  \"Well, now I will go up to the pony. One more lesson, and I think a baby might ride it.\"  As he walked along, he met Tom Thorne. There had been war between them, since the affair of the broken window. Reuben had shown the other no animosity on the subject as, having been cleared, he had felt in no way aggrieved; but Tom Thorne was very sore over it. In the first place, he had been found out; and although Reuben himself had said nothing to him, respecting his conduct in allowing him to be flogged for the offence which he himself had committed, others had not been so reticent, and he had had a hard time of it in the village. Secondly, he had been severely thrashed by his father, in the presence of the squire; the former laying on the lash with a vigour which satisfied Mr. Ellison, the heartiness of the thrashing being due, not to any indignation at the fault, but because the boy's conduct had excited the squire's anger; which Thorne, for many reasons, was anxious to deprecate. He was his landlord, and had the power to turn him out at a quarter's notice; and as there was no possibility of obtaining any other house near, and he was doing by no means a bad trade, he was anxious to keep on good terms with him.  Tom Thorne was sitting on a gate, as Reuben passed.  \"You think you be a fine fellow, Reuben, but I will be even with you, some day.\"  \"You can be even with me now,\" Reuben said, \"if you like to get off that gate.\"  \"I bain't afeared of you, Reuben, don't you go to think it; only I ain't going to do any fighting now. Feyther says if I get into any more rows, he will pay me out; so I can't lick you now, but some day I will be even with you.\"  \"That's a good excuse,\" Reuben said scornfully. \"However, I don't want to fight if you don't, only you keep your tongue to yourself. I don't want to say nothing to you, if you don't say nothing to me. You played me a dirty trick the other day, and you got well larrupped for it, so I don't owe you any grudge; but mind you, I don't want any more talk about your getting even with me, for if you do give me any more of it I will fetch you one on the nose, and then you will have a chance of getting even, at once.\"  Tom Thorne held his tongue, only relieving his feelings by making a grimace after Reuben, as the latter passed on. In the various contests among the boys of the village, Reuben had proved himself so tough an adversary that, although Tom Thorne was heavier and bigger, he did not care about entering upon what would be, at best, a doubtful contest with him.  Contenting himself, therefore, with another muttered, \"I will be even with you some day,\" he strolled home to his father's ale house.  The change at the school was very speedily made. The squire generally carried out his resolutions while they were hot and, on the very day after his conversation with his wife on the subject, he went first to the vicar and arranged for the retirement of the clerk, and the instalment of White in his place; and then went to the school house, and informed the master of his intention. The latter had been expecting his dismissal, since Mrs. Ellison had spoken to him on the previous day; and the news which the squire gave him was a relief to him. His emoluments, as clerk, would be smaller than those he received as schoolmaster; but while he would not be able to discharge the duties of the latter for very much longer, for he felt the boys were getting too much for him, he would be able to perform the very easy work entailed by the clerkship for many years to come. It was, too, a position not without dignity; and indeed, in the eyes of the village the clerk was a personage of far greater importance than the schoolmaster. He therefore thankfully accepted the offer, and agreed to give up the school as soon as a substitute could be found.  In those days anyone was considered good enough for a village schoolmaster, and the post was generally filled by men who had failed as tradesmen, and in everything else they put their hands to; and whose sole qualification for the office was that they were able to read and write. Instead of advertising, however, in the county paper, the squire wrote to an old college friend, who was now in charge of a London parish, and asked him to choose a man for the post.  \"I don't want a chap who will cram all sorts of new notions into the heads of the children,\" the squire said. \"I don't think it would do them any good, or fit them any better for their stations. The boys have got to be farm labourers, and the girls to be their wives; and if they can read really well, and write fairly, it's about as much as they want in the way of learning; but I think that a really earnest sort of man might do them good, otherwise. A schoolmaster, in my mind, should be the clergyman's best assistant. I don't know, my dear fellow, that I can explain in words more exactly what I mean; but I think you will understand me, and will send down the sort of man I want.  \"The cottage is a comfortable one, there's a good bit of garden attached to it, and I don't mind paying a few shillings a week more than I do now, to get the sort of man I want. If he has a wife so much the better. She might teach the girls to sew, which would be, to nine out of ten, a deal more use than reading and writing; and if she could use her needle, and make up dresses and that sort of thing, she might add to their income. Not one woman in five in the village can make her own clothes, and they have to go to a place three miles away to get them done.\"  A week later the squire received an answer from his friend, saying that he had chosen a man, and his wife, whom he thought would suit.  \"The poor fellow was rather a cripple,\" he said. \"He is a wood engraver by trade, but he fell downstairs and hurt his back. The doctor who attended him at the hospital spoke to me about him. He said that he might, under favourable circumstances, get better in time; but that he was delicate, and absolutely needed change of air and a country life. I have seen him several times, and have been much struck with his intelligence. He has been much depressed at being forbidden to work, but has cheered up greatly since I told him of your offer. I have no doubt he will do well.  \"I have selected him, not only for that reason, but because his wife is as suitable as he is. She is an admirable young woman, and was a dressmaker before he married her. She has supported them both ever since he was hurt, months ago. She is delighted at the idea of the change for, although the money will be very much less than he earned at his trade, she has always been afraid of his health giving way; and is convinced that fresh air, and the garden you speak of, will put new life into him.\"  The squire was not quite satisfied with the letter; but, as he told himself, he could not expect to get a man trained specially as a schoolmaster to accept the post; and at any rate, if the man was not satisfactory his wife was likely to be so. He accordingly ordered his groom to take the light cart and drive over to Lewes, the next day, to meet the coach when it came in; and to bring over the new schoolmaster, his wife, and their belongings.  Mrs. Ellison at once went down to the village, and got a woman to scrub the cottage from top to bottom, and put everything tidy. The furniture went with the house, and had been provided by the squire. Mrs. Ellison went over it, and ordered a few more things to be sent down from the house to make it more comfortable for a married couple and, driving over to Lewes, ordered a carpet, curtains, and a few other little comforts for it.  James Shrewsbury was, upon his arrival, much pleased with his cottage, which contrasted strongly with the room in a crowded street which he had occupied in London; and his wife was still more pleased.  \"I am sure we shall be happy and comfortable here, James,\" she said, \"and the air feels so fresh and pure that I am convinced you will soon get strong and well again. What is money to health? I am sure I shall be ten times as happy, here, as I was when you were earning three or four times as much, in London.\"  The squire and Mrs. Ellison came down the next morning, at the opening of the school; and after a chat with the new schoolmaster and his wife, the squire accompanied the former into the school room.  \"Look here, boys and girls,\" he said, \"Mr. Shrewsbury has come down from London to teach you. He has been ill, and is not very strong. I hope you will give him no trouble, and I can tell you it will be the worse for you, if you do. I am going to look into matters myself; and I shall have a report sent me in, regularly, as to how each of you is getting on, with a special remark as to conduct; and I can tell you, if any of you are troublesome you will find me down at your father's, in no time.\"  The squire's words had considerable effect, and an unusual quiet reigned in the school, after he had left and the new schoolmaster opened a book.  They soon found that his method of teaching was very different to that which they were accustomed to. There was no shouting or thumping on the desk with the cane, no pulling of ears or cuffing of heads. Everything was explained quietly and clearly; and when they went out of the school, all agreed that the new master was a great improvement on Master White, while the master himself reported to his wife that he had got on better than he had expected.    Chapter 2: The Poisoned Dog.   The boys soon felt that Mr. Shrewsbury really wished to teach them, and that he was ready to assist those who wanted to get on. In the afternoon the schoolmaster's wife started a sewing class for the girls and, a week or two after he came, the master announced that such of the elder class of boys and girls who chose to come, in the evening, to his cottage could do so for an hour; and that he and the boys would read, by turns, some amusing book while the girls worked. Only Reuben Whitney and two or three others at first availed themselves of the invitation, but these spoke so highly of their evening that the number soon increased. Three quarters of an hour were spent in reading some interesting work of travel or adventure, and then the time was occupied in talking over what they had read, and in explaining anything which they did not understand; and as the evenings were now long and dark, the visits to the schoolmaster soon came to be regarded as a privilege, and proved an incentive to work to those in the lower classes, only those in the first place being admitted to them.  Reuben worked hard all through the winter, and made very rapid progress; the schoolmaster, seeing how eager he was to get on, doing everything in his power to help him forward, and lending him books to study at home. One morning in the spring, the squire looked in at Mrs. Whitney's shop.  \"Mrs. Whitney,\" he said, \"I don't know what you are thinking of doing with that boy of yours. Mr. Shrewsbury gives me an excellent account of him, and says that he is far and away the cleverest and most studious of the boys. I like the lad, and owe him a good turn for having broken in that pony for my daughter; besides, for his father's sake I should like to help him on. Now, in the first place, what are you thinking of doing with him?\"  \"I am sure I am very much obliged to you,\" Mrs. Whitney said. \"I was thinking, when he gets a little older, of apprenticing him to some trade, but he is not fourteen yet.\"  \"The best thing you can do, Mrs. Whitney. Let it be some good trade, where he can use his wits--not a butcher, a baker, or a tailor, or anything of that sort. I should say an upholsterer, or a mill wright, or some trade where his intelligence can help him on. When the time comes I shall be glad to pay his apprentice fees for him, and perhaps, when you tell me what line he has chosen, a word from me to one of the tradesmen in Lewes may be a help. In the meantime, that is not what I have specially come about. Young Finch, who looks to my garden, is going to leave; and if you like, your boy can have the place. My gardener knows his business thoroughly, and the boy can learn under him. I will pay him five shillings a week. It will break him into work a little, and he is getting rather old for the school now. I have spoken to Shrewsbury, and he says that, if the boy is disposed to go on studying in the evening, he will direct his work and help him on.\"  \"Thank you kindly, sir,\" Mrs. Whitney said. \"I think it will just be the thing, for a year or so, before he is apprenticed. He was saying only last night that he was the biggest boy in the school; and though I know he likes learning, he would like to be helping me, and feels somehow that it isn't right that he should be going on schooling, while all the other boys at his age are doing something. Not that I want him to earn money, for the shop keeps us both; but it's what he thinks about it.\"  \"That's natural enough, Mrs. Whitney, and anything the boy earns with me, you see, you can put by, and it will come in useful to him some day.\"  Reuben was glad when he heard of the arrangement; for although, as his mother had said, he was fond of school, he yet felt it as a sort of reproach that, while others of his age were earning money, he should be doing nothing. He accepted the offer of the schoolmaster to continue to work at his studies in the evening, and in a week he was installed in Tom Finch's place.  The arrangement was not the squire's original idea, but that of his younger daughter, who felt a sort of proprietary interest in Reuben; partly because her evidence had cleared him of the accusation of breaking the windows, partly because he had broken in the pony for her; so when she heard that the boy was leaving, she had at once asked her father that Reuben should take his place.  \"I think he is a good boy, papa,\" she said; \"and if he was clever enough to break in my pony, I am sure he will be clever enough to wheel the wheelbarrow and pull weeds.\"  \"I should think he would, lassie,\" her father said, laughing, \"although it does not exactly follow. Still, if you guarantee that he is a good boy, I will see about it.\"  \"Mamma doesn't think he is a very good boy,\" Kate said; \"but you see, papa, mamma is a woman, and perhaps she doesn't understand boys and girls as well as I do. I think he's good, and he told me he never told stories.\"  The squire laughed.  \"I don't know what your mamma would say to that, puss; nor whether she would agree that you understand boys and girls better than she does. However, I will take your opinion this time, and give Reuben a chance.\"  The subject was not mentioned again in Kate's hearing, but she was greatly pleased, one morning, at seeing Reuben at work in the gardens.  \"Good morning, Reuben,\" she said.  \"Good morning, miss,\" he replied, touching his hat.  \"I am glad you have come in Tom's place, and I hope you will be good, and not get into scrapes, for I told papa I thought you would not; and you see, if you do, he will turn round and blame me.\"  \"I will try not to get into scrapes, Miss Kate,\" Reuben said. \"I don't do it often, you know, and I don't think there will be much chance of it, here.\"  Kate nodded and walked on, and Reuben went about his work.  There was, however, much more opportunity for getting into scrapes than Reuben imagined, although the scrapes were not of the kind he had pictured. Being naturally careless, he had not been there a week before, in his eagerness to get home to a particularly interesting book, he forgot to carry out his orders to shut the cucumber frames and, a sharp frost coming on in the night, the plants were all killed; to the immense indignation of the gardener, who reported the fact, with a very serious face, to the squire.  \"I am afraid that boy will never do, squire. Such carelessness I never did see, and them plants was going on beautifully.\"  \"Confound the young rascal!\" the squire said wrathfully, for he was fond of cucumbers. \"I will speak to him myself. This sort of thing will never do.\"  And accordingly, the squire spoke somewhat sharply to Reuben, who was really sorry for the damage his carelessness had caused; and he not only promised the squire that it should not occur again, but mentally resolved very firmly that it should not. He felt very shamefaced when Kate passed him in the garden, with a serious shake of her head, signifying that she was shocked that he had thus early got into a scrape, and discredited her recommendation.  The lesson was a useful one. Henceforth Reuben paid closer attention to his work, and even the gardener, who regarded boys as his great trial in life, expressed himself satisfied with him.  \"Since that affair of the cucumbers I must own, squire,\" he said a month later, \"that he is the best boy I have come across. He attends to what I say and remembers it, and I find I can trust him to do jobs that I have never been able to trust boys with, before. He seems to take an interest in it, and as he is well spoken and civil, he ought to get on and make a good gardener, in time.\"  \"I am glad to hear a good account of him,\" the squire replied. \"He is sharp and intelligent, and will make his way in life, or I am mistaken. His father was an uncommonly clever fellow, though he made a mess of it, just at the end; and I think the boy takes after him.\"  Among Reuben's other duties was that of feeding and attending to the dogs. These consisted of two setters, a pointer, and a large house dog, who was chained up at the entrance to the stables. Reuben was soon excellent friends with the sporting dogs, but the watchdog, who had probably been teased by Reuben's predecessor, always growled and showed his teeth when he went near him; and Reuben never dared venture within the length of his chain, but pushed the bowl containing his food just within his reach.  One day, he had been sent on an errand to the stables. He forgot the dog and ran close to the kennel. The animal at once sprang out. Reuben made a rush, but he was not quick enough, and the dog caught him by the leg. Reuben shouted, and the coachman ran out and, seizing a fork, struck the dog and compelled him to loose his hold.  \"Has he bit you badly, Reuben?\"  \"Well, he has bit precious hard,\" Reuben replied. \"I think he has nearly taken a piece out of my calf,\" as, on pulling up his trousers, he showed his leg streaming with blood.  \"Put it under the pump, lad. I will pump on it,\" the coachman said. \"He's a bad-tempered brute, and I wonder the squire keeps it.\"  \"The brute ought to be killed,\" Reuben grumbled angrily. \"I have never teased it or worried it, in any way. I wish you had stuck that fork into him, instead of hitting him with it. If you hadn't been within reach, he would have taken the bit out of me. He will kill somebody some day, and it were best to kill him, first.\"  The gardener pumped for some time on Reuben's leg; and then, going into the kitchen, he got some strips of rag from the cook and bound it up.  \"You had best go home now,\" he said. \"I will tell the gardener, when he comes round, what has happened to you. I doubt you will have to lay up, for a day or two.\"  As Reuben limped home, he met Tom Thorne walking with another boy.  \"Hello, Reuben!\" the latter exclaimed. \"What's come to you? Yer trousers bee all tore.\"  \"That brute of a house dog at the squire's has had hold of me,\" Reuben answered. \"The savage beast has had a try, a good many times; but this time he got hold, and he has bit me pretty sharp.\"  Reuben had to keep his leg quiet for three days but, the third evening, he was well enough to go down the village to the schoolhouse. After the lesson was over he walked for some distance up the road, for his leg was very stiff; and he thought it would be a good thing to try and walk it off, as he intended to go to work next morning. On getting up early in the morning, however, he found it was still stiff and sore; but he thought he had better go and try to work for a bit.  \"I am glad you are back again,\" the gardener said, when he saw him, \"for there's a lot of work on hand; but I see you are still lame. The coachman tells me it were a nasty bite.\"  \"It's pretty sore still,\" Reuben replied, \"and I don't think I can walk about much; but I thought I might help in some other way.\"  \"Very well,\" the gardener said. \"There are a lot of plants which want shifting into larger pots. You do them, and I will take up the fork and dig up that piece of ground I want to put the young lettuces into.\"  Reuben worked hard till half-past eight, and then went off to his breakfast. On his return, he was told the squire wished to speak to him.  \"It's about that dog, I expect,\" the gardener remarked. \"I suppose you know he were poisoned last night.\"  \"No, I didn't know,\" Reuben replied; \"but it's a precious good job. I wish he had been poisoned before he got his teeth into me.\"  Reuben, on going round to the back door, was shown into the library, where the squire was sitting. The coachman was with him.  \"Now then, Reuben,\" the squire said, \"I want you to tell me the truth about this matter. The coachman told me, three days ago, that you had been bitten by the yard dog, and I made up my mind to get rid of him, on the first opportunity; but I find he was poisoned, yesterday evening.\"  He stopped as if expecting Reuben to say something; but the boy, having nothing to say, merely replied:  \"Yes, sir, so the gardener has told me.\"  \"What do you know about it, Reuben?\"  \"I don't know anything about it, sir,\" Reuben replied, opening his eyes.  \"Now, look here, lad,\" the squire said gravely, \"I am disposed to think well of you; and although I consider it a serious offence your poisoning the dog, I shall consider it very much worse if you deny it.\"  \"But I didn't poison it, sir,\" Reuben affirmed. \"I never dreamt of such a thing.\"  The squire set his lips hard together.  \"Just tell me your story over again,\" he said to the coachman.  \"Well, yesterday evening, squire, I went down into the village to buy some 'bacca. Just as I got back to the gate, out runs a boy. It was too dark for me to see his face, but I naturally supposed it were Reuben, so I said, 'Hello, Reuben, how's the leg?' But the moment I spoke, he turned off from the path and ran away.  \"Well, I thought it was queer, but I went on to the stable. About a quarter of an hour afterwards, and as I was a-cleaning up the bits, I heard Wolf howl. He kept on at it, so I took a lantern and went out to see what was the matter. He was rolling about, and seemed very bad. I stood a-looking at him, wondering what were best to do, when sudden he gave a sort of yell, and rolled over, and he was dead. I thought it was no good telling you about it till this morning; and thinking it over, and seeing how sudden like it was, I come to the 'pinion as how he had been poisoned; and naturally thinking that, as he had bit Reuben, and as how Reuben said he ought to be killed, and seeing as I had met the boy a quarter an hour afore the dog was took bad, it came to me as how he had done it.  \"This morning I knew for certain as the dog had been poisoned, for just outside of the reach of his chain there was that piece of paper a-lying, as you have got before you.\"  It was a piece of blue paper, about four inches square, on which was printed: \"Rat poison.\"  \"You hear that, Reuben? What have you to say?\" the squire asked.  \"I have got nothing to say, sir,\" Reuben answered, \"except that whoever the boy was, it wasn't me, and that I know nothing about it.\"  \"Well, Reuben, it will be easy for you to clear yourself, by saying where you were at the time.  \"What o'clock was it, Robert, that you saw the boy?\"  \"It was just a quarter past eight, squire. The quarter struck just as I opened the gate.\"  \"Were you out or at home at that hour, Reuben?\"  \"I was out, sir. I went to the schoolmaster's.\"  \"What time did you leave there?\"  \"I left at eight, sir.\"  \"Then if you got in just after eight, it is clear that you were not the boy,\" the squire said. \"If your mother tells me that you were in at five minutes past eight, that settles the question, as far as you are concerned.\"  \"I didn't get in till half-past eight, sir,\" Reuben said. \"I walked about for a bit, after I came out from school, to try and get the stiffness out of my leg, so as to be able to come to work this morning.\"  \"Was anyone with you, Reuben? Is there anyone to say what you did with yourself, between eight and half-past eight?\"  \"No, sir,\" Reuben said quietly. \"I didn't speak to a soul; and didn't see a soul, so far as I know, from the time I came out of the gate of the schoolhouse till I got home.\"  \"Does your mother sell packets of this poison?\" the squire said, pointing to the paper.  Reuben looked at the paper.  \"Yes, sir; I believe she does.\"  \"Well, my lad,\" the squire said, \"you must acknowledge that the case looks very ugly against you. You are known to have borne bad feelings against the dog; naturally enough, I admit. A boy about your size was seen by Robert in the dark, coming out of the gate; and that he was there for no good purpose is proved by the fact that he ran away when spoken to. A quarter of an hour later, the dog dies of poison. That poison you certainly could get at home and, by your own admission, you were out and about at the time the dog was poisoned. The case looks very bad against you.\"  \"I don't care how bad it looks,\" Reuben said, passionately. \"It wasn't me, squire, if that were the last word I ever had to speak.\"  \"Very well,\" the squire said coldly. \"In my mind, the evidence is overwhelming against you. I have no intention of pursuing the matter further; nor will I, for your father's and mother's sake, bring public disgrace upon you; but of course I shall not retain you here further, nor have anything to do with you, in the future.\"  Without a word, Reuben turned and left the room. Had he spoken, he would have burst into a passion of tears. With a white face, he walked through the village and entered his mother's shop.  \"What? Back again, Reuben?\" she said. \"I thought your leg was too bad to work.\"  \"It isn't my leg, mother,\" he said, in a choking voice. \"The squire has dismissed me. He says I have poisoned his dog.\"  \"Says you poisoned his dog, Reuben! Whatever put such an idea into his head?\"  \"The coachman saw a boy coming out of the yard, at a quarter past eight last night. It was too dark for him to say for certain, but he thought it was me. A quarter of an hour later the dog died of poison, and this morning they picked up a cover of one of those rat powders you sell. I couldn't say where I was at a quarter past eight, when the coachman saw the boy; for as you know, mother, I told you I had walked out a bit, after I came out from the school, to get the stiffness out of my leg. So, altogether, the squire has made up his mind 'tis me, and so he has sent me away.\"  Reuben had summed up the points against himself in a broken voice, and now broke into a passion of tears. His mother tried in vain to pacify him; but indeed her own indignation, at her boy being charged with such a thing, was so great that she could do little to console him.  \"It's shameful!\" she exclaimed, over and over again. \"I call it downright wicked of the squire to suspect you of such a thing.\"  \"Well, mother, it does look very bad against me,\" Reuben said, wiping his eyes at last, \"and I don't know as the squire is so much to be blamed for suspecting me. I know and you know that it wasn't me; but there's no reason why the squire should know it. Somebody has poisoned his dog, and that somebody is a boy. He knows that I was unfriendly with the dog so, putting things together, I don't see as he could help suspecting me, and only my word the other way. It seems to me as if somebody must have done it to get me in a row, for I don't know that the dog had bit anyone else. If it is anyone, I expect it's Tom Thorne. He has never been friends with me, since that affair of the school window.\"  \"I will go at once and speak to his father,\" Mrs. Whitney said, taking down her bonnet from the wall.  \"No, mother, you can't do that,\" Reuben exclaimed. \"We have got nothing against him. The squire has ten times as good reason to suspect me, as I have to suspect Tom Thorne; so as we know the squire's wrong, it's ten times as likely we shall be wrong. Besides, if he did it, of course he would deny it, he is the worst liar in the village; and then folks would say I wasn't satisfied with doing it myself, but I wanted to throw the blame on to him, just as he did on me before. No, it won't do, mother.\"  Mrs. Whitney saw that it wouldn't do, and sat down again. Reuben sat thinking, for some time.  \"I must go away, mother,\" he said at last. \"I can't stop here. Every one in the village will get to know of it, and they will point at me as the boy as poisoned the squire's dog, and then lied about it. I couldn't stand that, mother.\"  \"And you sha'n't stand it, my boy,\" Mrs. Whitney said, \"not a day. I will give up the cottage and move into Lewes, at once. I didn't go there before, for I am known there, and don't like folk to see how much I have come down in the world.\"  \"No, mother, you stop here, and I will go up to London. They say there is lots of work there, and I suppose I can get on as well as another.\"  \"I will not hear of your doing such a thing. I should never expect to hear of you again. I should always be thinking that you had got run over, or were starving in the streets, or dying in a workhouse. No, Reuben, my plan's best. It's just silliness my not liking to settle in Lewes; for of course it's better going where one is known, and I should be lost in a strange place. No; I daresay I shall find a cottage there, and I shall manage to get a living somehow--perhaps open a little shop like this, and then you can be apprenticed, and live at home.\"  An hour later, Mrs. Ellison called. Reuben had gone upstairs to lie down, for his leg was very painful. Mrs. Whitney did not give her visitor time to begin.  \"I know what you have called about, Mrs. Ellison, and I don't want to talk about it with you. The squire has grievously wronged my boy. I wouldn't have believed it of him, but he's done it; so now, ma'm, I give a week's notice of this house, and here's my rent up to that time, and I will send you the key when I go. And now, ma'm, as I don't want any words about it, I think it will be better if you go, at once.\"  Mrs. Ellison hesitated a moment. Never, from the time she entered the village as the squire's wife, had she been thus spoken to; but she saw at once, in Mrs. Whitney's face, that it were better not to reply to her; and that her authority as the squire's wife had, for once, altogether vanished. She therefore took up the money which Mrs. Whitney had laid on the counter and, without a word, left the shop.  \"I do believe, William,\" she said as, greatly ruffled and indignant, she gave an account of the interview to the squire, \"that the woman would have slapped my face, if I had said anything. She is the most insolent creature I ever met.\"  \"Well, my dear,\" the squire said seriously, \"I can hardly wonder at the poor woman's indignation. She has had a hard time of it, and this must be a sad blow. Naturally she believes in her son's innocence, and we must not altogether blame her, if she resents his dismissal. It's a sad business altogether, and I know it will be a worry and trouble to me for months. Mind, I don't doubt that the boy did it; it does not seem possible that it should be otherwise. Still, it is not absolutely proved; and upon my word, I wish now I had said nothing at all about it. I like the boy, and I liked his father before him; and as this story must get about, it cannot but do him serious damage. Altogether it is a most tiresome business, and I would give a hundred pounds if it hadn't taken place.\"  \"I really do not see why you should worry about it, William. The boy has always been a troublesome boy, and perhaps this lesson may do him good.\"  The squire did not attempt to argue the question. He felt really annoyed and put out and, after wandering over the ground and stables, he went down to the schoolhouse after the children had been dismissed.  \"Have you heard, Shrewsbury, about that boy Whitney?\"  \"No, sir, I have heard nothing about him,\" the schoolmaster said. \"He was here yesterday evening, as usual. His leg is no worse, I hope. Those dog bites are always nasty things.\"  \"I wish it had been worse,\" the squire said testily; \"then he would have been laid up quietly at home, instead of being about mischief.\"  \"Why, what has he done, sir?\" the schoolmaster asked, in surprise.  The squire related the history of the dog's death, and of his interview with Reuben. The schoolmaster looked serious, and grieved.  \"What do you think of the matter, Shrewsbury?\" the squire asked, when he had finished.  \"I would rather not give any opinion,\" the schoolmaster replied quietly.  \"That means you think I am wrong,\" the squire said quickly. \"Well, say it out, man; you won't offend me. I am half inclined to think I was wrong, myself; and I would as lief be told so, as not.\"  \"I don't say you are wrong, sir,\" the schoolmaster said, \"except that I think you assumed the boy's guilt too much as a matter of course. Now, I have seen a great deal of him. I have a great liking for him, and believe him to be not only a singularly intelligent and hard-working lad, but a perfectly truthful and open one. I allow that the circumstances are much against him; but the evidence is, to my mind, completely overbalanced by his absolute denial. You must remember that he saw that you were quite convinced of his guilt; and that, in your eyes, his denial would be an aggravation of the offence. Therefore you see he had no strong motive for telling a lie.  \"Who killed your dog I do not know but, from my knowledge of his character and assurance of his truthfulness, I am perfectly convinced that Reuben Whitney did not do it. The boy is, in some ways, very superior to the other lads I teach. I hear that his father was in a good position, as a miller; and his mother is of a different class, altogether, to the other women of the village. The boy has a certain refinement about him, a thoughtfulness and consideration which set him apart from the others. Mischievous and somewhat inclined to be noisy as he generally is, on days when I have not felt quite equal to my work he would notice it at once and, without saying a word, would, by his quietness and attention to his work, try to save me trouble; and I have heard him try to quiet the others, as they trooped out. The boy has a good heart as well as a good intellect, and nothing save his own confession would make me believe that he poisoned your dog.\"  \"But he said he wished it was killed,\" the squire urged, as in defence of his own opinion.  \"He said so, squire, at the time he was smarting with the pain of a severe bite; and I think probably he meant no more than a man who, under the same circumstances, would say, 'Confound the dog!' or even a stronger oath.\"  Mr. Ellison was silenced, for when in wrath he was, himself, given to use strong expressions.  \"I don't know what to say, Shrewsbury,\" he said at last. \"I am afraid I have made a mess of it; but certainly, as I first heard it, the case seemed to admit of no doubt. 'Pon my word, I don't know what to do. My wife has just been up to see Mrs. Whitney, and the woman blazed out at her, and wouldn't let her say a word, but gave notice that she should give up the house at the end of the week. If it hadn't been for that, I might have done something; but Mrs. Ellison was very much aggrieved at her manner. Altogether, it's one of the most annoying things I ever had to do with.\"  In the evening the schoolmaster put on his hat and went up, with his wife, to Mrs. Whitney. The women had seen a good deal of each other, as they both stood somewhat apart from the rest of the village and, in thought and speech, differed widely from the labourers' wives; and on evenings when the sewing class did not meet, the schoolmaster's wife often went up for an hour or two to Mrs. Whitney's, or the latter came down to the Shrewsburys' cottage.  \"We have come up, Mrs. Whitney,\" the schoolmaster said as they entered, \"to tell you how sorry we are to hear that you are going to leave, and that we are still more sorry for the cause. Of course, neither my wife nor myself believe for a moment that Reuben poisoned the squire's dog. The idea is preposterous. I told the squire as much, today.\"  Mrs. Whitney burst into tears. She had kept up all day, sustained partly by indignation, and partly by the desire that Reuben should not see that she felt it; but the thought that all the village would believe Reuben guilty had cut her to the heart, and she had felt so unwilling to face anyone that, as soon as Mrs. Ellison had left, she had closed the shutters of her little shop; but she broke down, now, from her relief at hearing that someone besides herself believed the boy to be innocent.  \"I don't know what I shall do without you, Mrs. Whitney,\" Mrs. Shrewsbury said, when the widow recovered her composure. \"I shall miss you dreadfully. Is it quite settled that you will go?\"  \"Quite settled, Mrs. Shrewsbury. I wouldn't stop in the squire's house for an hour longer than I could help, after his believing Reuben to be guilty of poisoning his dog, and not believing the boy when he said he had nothing to do with it. He ought to have known my boy better than that. And he coming up only the other day, and pretending he felt a kindness for my dead husband.\"  \"I think the squire was too hasty, Mrs. Whitney,\" the schoolmaster said. \"But you see, he did not know Reuben as we do; and I think, if you will excuse my saying so, you have been a little hasty, too. The squire came in to me to tell me about it, and I could see he was not satisfied in his mind, even before I gave him my positive opinion that Reuben was innocent; and I do think that, if you had not given Mrs. Ellison notice so sharply, the squire would have taken back his words; and said that at any rate, as there was nothing absolutely proved, he would hold his judgment in suspense until the matter was cleared up.\"  \"And having everyone pointing the finger at my boy in the meantime! No, thank you, Mr. Shrewsbury, that would not do for me. I was not a bit hasty. Mrs. Ellison came in here prepared to talk to me about Reuben's wickedness; I saw it in her face, so I wouldn't let her open her lips. If she had, I should have given her a piece of my mind that she wouldn't have forgot, in a hurry.\"  \"I can quite understand your feelings, Mrs. Whitney,\" the schoolmaster said, \"and I have no doubt I should have acted as you did, if a son of mine had been suspected in the same way. Still, I think it's a pity; for if Reuben had stayed here, there would have been more chance of the matter being cleared up. However, we won't talk about that now. Now tell me, what are your plans?\"  Mrs. Whitney told her visitors what she had determined upon. As Lewes was only four miles off, the schoolmaster said that he and his wife would sometimes come over to see her; and that he hoped that Reuben, whatever trade he was apprenticed to, would still go on with his studies. He would give him any advice or assistance in his power.  The next day Mrs. Whitney and Reuben moved, with all their belongings, to Lewes.    Chapter 3: The Burglary At The Squire's.   \"What is that woman Whitney going to do with her boy?\" the squire asked the schoolmaster, when he happened to meet him in the village about a month after she had left. \"Have you heard?\"  \"Nothing is settled yet, sir. My wife had a letter from her, two or three days ago, saying that she had been disappointed in getting Penfold the mill wright to take him. He wanted fifty pounds premium, and she could only afford to pay twenty, so she is looking out for something else. You have heard nothing more that would throw any light on that affair, squire?\"  \"No, and don't suppose I ever shall. Have you any opinion about it?\"  \"My opinion is that of Reuben, himself,\" the schoolmaster said. \"He believes that someone did it who had a grudge against him, on purpose, to throw suspicion on him.\"  \"Who should have a grudge against him?\" the squire asked.  \"Well, squire, there was one boy in the village who had, rightly or wrongly, a grudge against Reuben. That is Tom Thorne. Reuben has not a shadow of evidence that it was this boy, but the lad has certainly been his enemy ever since that affair of breaking the windows of the school, just before I came here. Thorne, you know, did it, but allowed Reuben to be punished for the offence; and the truth would never have been known had it not been, as I heard, that your daughter happened to see the stone thrown. Since that time there has been bad blood between the boys. I do not for a moment say that Thorne poisoned your dog. Still, the boys are near enough of a size for one to be mistaken for the other in the dark; and Thorne knew that Reuben had been bitten by the dog, for Reuben spoke to another boy about it, that afternoon, while Thorne was standing by. Of course, this is but the vaguest suspicion. Still, if you ask my opinion, I should say that I consider, from what I have heard of the character of Tom Thorne, that he would be much more likely to poison the dog, in order to get Reuben into disgrace, than Reuben would be to do so out of revenge because the dog had bitten him.\"  The squire took off his hat, and passed his hands through his hair, in perplexity.  \"I don't know what to think, Shrewsbury,\" he said. \"It may be as you say. I look upon Thorne as the worst character in the village, and likely enough his son may take after him. That ale house of his is the resort of all the idle fellows about. I have strong reason to believe he is in alliance with the poachers. The first time I get a chance, out he goes. I have only been waiting, for some time, for an opportunity. I can't very well turn him out of his house without some excuse.  \"What did you say was the name of the mill wright at Lewes Mrs. Whitney was wanting to get her son with?\"  The schoolmaster repeated the name, which the squire jotted down in a notebook.  \"Look here, Shrewsbury,\" he said, \"don't you mention to Mrs. Whitney that you spoke to me about this matter. Do you understand?\"  \"I understand, sir,\" the schoolmaster said.  And he was not surprised when, a few days afterwards, his wife received a letter from Mrs. Whitney, saying that Mr. Penfold had come in to say that he had changed his mind, and that he would take Reuben as his apprentice for twenty pounds; adding, to her surprise, that he should give him half a crown a week for the first year, and gradually raise his pay, as he considered that boys ought to be able to earn a little money for themselves.  Reuben, therefore, was going to work on the following week. The half a crown a week which he was to earn was an important matter for his mother. For although she had found a cottage and opened a little shop, as before, her receipts were extremely small, and she had already begun to fear that she should be obliged to make another move, Lewes being too well supplied with shops for a small concern like hers to flourish. The half crown a week, however, would pay her rent; and she expected that she should make, at any rate, enough to provide food for herself and Reuben.  Mrs. Whitney had hoped that, although Lewes was but four miles from the village, the story about the dog would not travel so far; for it was not often that anyone from the village went over to the town. In this, however, she was mistaken for, a week after Reuben had gone to work, the foreman went to his master and said:  \"I don't know whether you are aware, Mr. Penfold, about that new boy; but I hear that he had to leave Tipping, where he was employed by Squire Ellison, for poisoning the squire's dog.\"  \"How did you hear it?\" Mr. Penfold asked.  \"William Jenkins heard it from a man named Thorne, who belongs to the village, and whom he met at a public house, yesterday.\"  \"William Jenkins had best not spend so much time in public houses,\" Mr. Penfold said shortly. \"I heard the story before I saw the boy and, from what I hear, I believe he was wrongfully accused. Just tell Jenkins that; and say that if I hear of him, or any of the hands, throwing the thing up in the boy's face, I will dismiss them instantly.\"  And so Reuben did not know, till long after, that the story of the killing of the dog was known to anyone at Lewes.  For three years he worked in Mr. Penfold's yard, giving much satisfaction to his employer by his steadiness and handiness. He continued his studies of an evening, under the advice of his former master; who came over with his wife, three or four times each year, to spend a day with Mrs. Whitney. Reuben was now receiving ten shillings a week and, although the receipts of the shop failed, he and his mother were able to live in considerable comfort.  One day, about three years after coming to Lewes, he was returning to work after dinner when, as he passed a carriage standing in front of one of the shops, he heard his name pronounced, and the colour flushed to his cheek as, looking up, he saw Kate Ellison. Timidly he touched his cap, and would have hurried on, but the girl called to him.  \"Stop a minute, Reuben. I want to speak to you. I am glad I have met you. I have looked for you, every time I have come to Lewes. I wanted to tell you that I am sure you did not kill Wolf. I know you wouldn't have done it. Besides, you know, you told me that you never told stories; so when I heard that you said you didn't, I was quite sure about it.\"  \"Thank you, miss,\" Reuben said gratefully. \"I did not kill the dog. I should never have thought of such a thing, though every one seemed against me.\"  \"Not every one, Reuben. I didn't think so; and papa has told me, since, that he did not think so, and that he was afraid that he had made a mistake.\"  \"I am glad to hear that, miss,\" Reuben said. \"The squire had been very kind to me, and it has always grieved me, very much, that he should think me capable of such a thing. I felt angry at the time, but I have not felt angry since I have thought it over quietly; for the case seems so strong against me that I don't see how the squire could have thought otherwise.  \"Thank you, miss. I sha'n't forget your kindness,\" and Reuben went on with a light heart, just as Mrs. Ellison and her elder daughter came out from the shop.  \"Who were you speaking to, Kate?\" she asked, as she took her seat in the carriage.  \"I was talking to Reuben Whitney, mamma. He was passing, so I called him to tell him that I did not believe he had killed Wolf.\"  \"Then it was very improper behaviour on your part, Kate,\" her mother said angrily, for she had never quite recovered from the shock Mrs. Whitney had given to her dignity. \"You know my opinion on the subject. I have told you before that it is one I do not care to have discussed, and that I consider it very improper for a girl, of your age, to hold opinions different to those of your elders. I have no doubt, whatever, that boy poisoned the dog. I must beg of you that you will never speak to him again.\"  Kate leaned back in the carriage with a little sigh. She could not understand why her mother, who was so kind to all the village people, should be so implacable on this subject. But Kate, who was now between fourteen and fifteen, knew that when her mother had taken up certain opinions they were not to be shaken; and that her father himself always avoided argument, on points on which he differed from her. Talking alone with his daughter the squire had, in answer to her sturdy assertion of Reuben's innocence, owned to her that he himself had his doubts on the subject, and that he was sorry he had dismissed the boy from his service; but she had never heard him do more than utter a protest, against Reuben's guilt being held as being absolutely proved, when her mother spoke of his delinquency.  But Kate was not one to desert a protege and, having been the means of Reuben's introduction to her father's, she had always regarded herself as his natural protector; and Mrs. Ellison would not have been pleased, had she known that her daughter had seldom met the schoolmaster without inquiring if he had heard how Reuben was getting on. She had even asked Mr. Shrewsbury to assure him of her belief in his innocence, which had been done; but she had resolved that, should she ever meet him, she would herself tell him so, even at the risk of her mother's displeasure.  Another year passed. Reuben was now seventeen, and was a tall, powerfully-built young fellow. During these four years he had never been over to Tipping, in the daytime; but had occasionally walked over, after dark, to visit the Shrewsburys, always going on special invitation, when he knew that no one else would be there. The Thornes no longer occupied the little public house. Tom Thorne had, a year before, been captured with two other poachers in the squire's woods, and had had six months' hard labour; and his father had at once been ejected from his house, and had disappeared from that part of the country. Reuben was glad that they had left; for he had long before heard that Thorne had spread the story, in Lewes, of the poisoning of the dog. He felt, however, with their departure all chance of his ever being righted in that matter was at an end.  One evening in winter, when Reuben had done his work, he said to his mother:  \"I shall go over and see Mr. Shrewsbury tonight. I have not been over for some time and, as it is not his night for a class, I am pretty sure not to find anyone there. I told him, when I was there last, that I would take over a few tools and fix up those shelves for him.  \"I don't suppose he will stay very much longer at Tipping. His health is completely restored now, and even his wife admits that he could work at his own business again. He has already been doing a little, for some of the houses he worked for in town, so as to get his connection back again. I expect, every time I see him, to hear that he has made up his mind to go. He would have done it, two years back; but his wife and the two little ones are so well that he did not like the thought of taking them up to London, till he was sure that his health was strong enough to stand steady work. I shall miss them very much. He has been a good friend, indeed, to me.\"  \"He has indeed,\" Mrs. Whitney said. \"I think anyhow, Reuben, you would have got on at your trade; but you would never have been what you are now, if it hadn't been for him. Your poor father would be proud of you, if he could see you; and I am sure that, when you take off that workman's suit and put on your Sunday clothes, you look as well as if the mill had never gone wrong, and you had been brought up as he intended you to be. Mrs. Tyler was saying only the other day that you looked quite the gentleman, and lots of people have said the same.\"  \"Nonsense, mother,\" Reuben answered, \"there is nothing of the gentleman about me. Of course, people say things that they think will please you, knowing that you regard me as a sort of wonder. I hope I shall make my way some day, and the fact that I have had a better education than most young fellows, in my position of life, of course may make some little difference; and will, I hope, help me to mount the ladder, when once I put my foot upon it.\"  But although, no doubt, Mrs. Whitney was a partial judge, her opinion as to her son was not an incorrect one; for with his intelligent face, and quiet self-assured bearing, he looked very much more like a gentleman than many young fellows in a far better position in life.  The stars were shining brightly when he started, at seven o'clock in the evening; and he walked with a brisk step, until he arrived within half a mile of the village. As he passed by the end of a lane which ran into the road, he heard a horse impatiently pawing the ground; the sound being followed by a savage oath, to the animal, to stand quiet. Reuben walked on a few steps, and then paused. The lane, as he knew, only led to some fields a short distance away. What could a horse be doing there? And who could be the man who spoke to it? There had, lately, been several burglaries on lonely houses, in that part of the country; and the general belief was that these had been perpetrated by men from London.  \"I daresay it's nothing,\" Reuben said to himself. \"Still, it is certainly curious and, at any rate, there can be no harm in having a look.\"  Walking upon the grass at the side of the road, he retraced his steps to the end of the lane, and then stood and listened. He heard a murmur of voices, and determined to follow the matter up. He walked quietly down the lane. After going about a hundred yards, he saw something dark in the road and, approaching it very cautiously, found that it was a horse harnessed to a gig. As he was standing wondering what to do next he started, for the silence was broken by some voices near him.  \"It was a stupid thing to get here so early, and to have to wait about for four hours in this ditch.\"  \"It was the best plan though,\" another voice replied. \"The trap might have been noticed, if we had been driving about the roads after dark; while in the daylight no one would give it a second thought.\"  \"That's right enough,\" the first speaker said, \"but it's precious cold here. Hand me that flask again. I am blest if the wind does not come through the hedge like a knife.\"  The voices came from the other side of the hedge, on the opposite side of the lane. Reuben crossed noiselessly. There was a gate just where the cart had stopped, and the men had evidently got over it, to obtain the shelter of the hedge from the wind. Reuben felt the gate, which was old and rickety; then cautiously he placed his feet on the lower bar, and leaned forward so as to look round the hedge.  \"What time are the others to be here, Tom?\"  \"They said they would be here at nine o'clock. We passed them about six miles on the road, so they ought to be here to time.\"  \"I suppose there's no doubt about this here being a good business?\"  \"I will answer for that,\" the other said. \"I don't suppose as there's much money in the house, but there's no end of silver plate, and their watches, and plenty of sparklers. I have heard say as there's no one in the county as has more jewels than the squire's wife.\"  \"You know the house well, don't you?\"  \"I never was inside,\" the other said, \"but I have heard enough, from them that has, to know where the rooms lie. The plate chest is in the butler's pantry and, as we are going to get in by the kitchen window, we are safe to be able to clear that out without being heard. I shall go on, directly the others come, and chuck this meat to the dogs--that will silence them. I know the way there, for I tried that on once before.\"  Reuben had thought that the voice was familiar to him, and the words gave him the clue--the speaker was Tom Thorne--and he, and those with him, were going to commit a burglary at the squire's. He was hesitating whether to make off at once, to warn the squire of what was intended; or to listen and learn a little more of their plan, when suddenly a light shone behind him, and a voice exclaimed with an oath:  \"Who have we here?\"  He leapt down, and was in the act of turning round to defend himself, when a heavy blow with a cudgel struck him on the head, and felled him insensible to the ground. While he had been listening to the conversation, two men had come quietly up the lane, walking on the grass as he had done; and their footsteps had been unheard by him, for the horse continued, at times, impatiently to paw the ground. The sound of their comrades' voices had told them where they were sitting and, turning on a bull's-eye lantern to show them the gate, they had seen Reuben leaning over it, in the act of listening.  When Reuben recovered consciousness, he found that he was lying in the ditch, his hands tightly bound to his sides, and a handkerchief stuffed into his mouth. The four men were gathered close by, talking in low tones.  \"I ain't going to give up the job, now we come so far to do it,\" one said, with an oath. \"Besides, it's not only the swag, but the grudge I owe the squire. If I am ready to go on, I suppose you needn't be afraid; besides, he don't know us.\"  \"Best cut his throat and a done with it,\" a voice, which Reuben recognized as that of his old enemy, said. \"I owe him one, and it will be safest to stop his mouth.\"  \"No, no,\" a third voice protested; \"I ain't going to have nothing to do with cutting throats. I don't mind running the risk of Botany Bay, but I ain't going to run the chance of being scragged. But let's move a bit away from here, while we settle it. You hit him pretty hard, but he will be coming round presently. I thought at first that you had killed him, but he's bleeding too free for that.\"  The men moved some little distance away, and for some time Reuben could hear a murmured talk, but could make out nothing of what had been said. It was, he judged, a quarter of an hour before the conversation ceased. They did not return to him but remained at some distance off, and Reuben thought that he heard the footsteps of one of them going down the lane. He could feel, by a warm sensation across his cheek, that the blood was flowing freely from the wound he had received on his temple. A dull torpid feeling came over him, and after a time he again lost consciousness.  How long he remained in this state he did not know, but he was at last aroused by being lifted and thrown into the bottom of the cart. Four men then climbed up into it and the horse was started. They drove at a quick pace, and Reuben wondered why they were taking him away with them. His head ached terribly, and he suffered much from the tightness of the cords which bound his arms. The men seemed in high good humour, and talked and laughed in low tones; but the noise of the vehicle prevented Reuben hearing what was said.  It was, as far as he could judge, full two hours before the vehicle stopped. He was roughly taken out of the cart, his arms were unbound; and the men, leaping up, drove away at full speed. The spot where he had been left was very dark, for trees overshadowed it on both sides. Where he was he had no idea, but he judged that he must be fully twenty miles from the village.  His first impulse was to take the handkerchief from his mouth, and he then walked slowly along the road, in the direction from which he had come. It was, he felt sure, no use shouting; for they would have been certain to have selected some lonely spot to set him down, and there would be no chance of awakening the inhabitants of any distant cottage. He walked slowly, for he was faint with loss of blood.  After proceeding about a quarter of a mile, he emerged from the wood and came upon a spot where the road forked. Having no clue whatever as to the direction in which Lewes lay, he sat down upon a heap of stones and waited patiently for morning. He had no doubt that the burglary had been a successful one, and he bitterly regretted his neglect to keep a watch down the lane, to see that he was not surprised by the men he had heard were coming. At any rate, he hoped that he should be able to give such information as would set the constables upon the track.  It seemed to him that some three hours passed before a faint light began to dawn in the sky. By this he knew that it must be about half-past six, and calculated, therefore, he must have set out in the trap about half-past one. He now started to walk along the road, hoping that he should soon meet some labourer going to work. Stopping by a small stream which ran across the road, he washed his head and face; as he had lain on the ground after being struck, the blood had not flowed on to his clothes.  After the wash he proceeded with a brisker step. Half an hour later he met a ploughman, riding one of his team to the fields.  \"Is this the road to Lewes?\" Reuben asked.  \"Lewes? Noa, this baint the road to Lewes. I don't know nothing about the road to Lewes. This bee the road to Hastings, if you goes further. So they tell me; I ain't never been there.\"  \"Is there a village anywhere about here?\" Reuben asked.  \"Ay, half a mile or so on.\"  Reuben walked on till he got to the village; and then, going to a public house, obtained some refreshment and learned, from the landlord, the direction he should take to get to the main road leading to Lewes; which was, as he expected, some twenty miles away. He found that the cart had not followed the main road towards London, but had driven by crossroads for a considerable distance, before turning north.  It was late in the afternoon before Reuben arrived at Lewes, for he had been obliged to rest often by the way, and had made but slow progress. When within a few doors of his mother's house, one of the constables of the town came up to him and touched him on the shoulder.  \"I arrest you in the king's name!\"  \"Arrest me! What for?\" Reuben exclaimed.  \"For breaking into the house of Squire Ellison, of Tipping, that's what it's for.\"  Reuben laughed.  \"You have got the wrong man this time. I have no more to do with the burglary than a child.\"  \"It's no laughing matter,\" the constable said. \"If you are innocent you have got to prove it; that ain't no business of mine. All I have got to do is to arrest you.\"  So saying, and before Reuben knew what he was about, he slipped a pair of handcuffs over his wrists. Reuben flushed up. Hitherto he had scarcely taken the matter seriously, but to be marched handcuffed through the streets of Lewes was an indignity which enraged him.  \"Take these off,\" he said angrily. \"I will go quietly with you.\"  \"You may or you may not,\" the man said doggedly. \"You are younger than I am, and maybe can run faster. I ain't agoing to chance it.\"  Reuben saw that it was of no use to argue and, silent and pale, he walked along by the side of the constable, who retained a tight hold of his collar. A little crowd gathered speedily round, for such a sight was unusual in Lewes; and Reuben felt thankful when they reached the cells, and he was sheltered from the gaze of the public. A minute later the head constable came in.  \"Now, my lad, don't say anything to criminate yourself,\" he began; \"the less you talk, the better for you. I am sorry to see you here, for I knew your father, and I have a good character of you from your employer; so I give you my advice--keep your mouth shut.\"  \"But I am not going to keep my mouth shut,\" Reuben said indignantly. \"Here am I, arrested in the public streets, marched handcuffed through the town upon a most monstrous charge, which has been brought against me without a shadow of evidence.\"  \"Don't be talking, don't be talking,\" the constable said testily; \"you will hear the evidence in time enough.\"  \"But I will talk. I want to tell you what's happened, and you will see that I am innocent, at once.\"  \"Very well, if you will you will; but mind, don't blame me afterwards.\"  Reuben told the story of his adventures from the time of leaving.  \"There,\" he said when he finished, \"isn't that enough to show that I am innocent?\"  \"No,\" the chief constable said gravely, \"it's not enough to prove anything, one way or the other. I am bound to say the story looks a likely one; and if it weren't for two or three matters which I heard of, from the constable who came over from Tipping, I should have no doubt about it. However, all that is for the magistrate to decide. There will be a meeting tomorrow.\"  \"But can't I be taken before a magistrate at once? There's Captain Fidler, within a mile.\"  \"What would be the good?\" the chief constable said. \"You don't suppose anyone would let you out, only on the strength of the story you have told me. He could only remand you, and you could gain nothing by it.\"  \"Can I see my mother?\" Reuben asked next.  \"Yes,\" the constable said, \"I will send her down a message, at once.\"  Mrs. Whitney soon came up. A neighbour had brought her in the news when Reuben had been arrested, and she was on the point of starting to inquire about it when the message arrived. She was more indignant than grieved, when she heard the charge which had been brought against Reuben.  \"The idea of such a thing!\" she exclaimed. \"These constables don't seem to have natural sense. The idea of charging anyone who is known as a respectable young man with such a thing as that, and shutting him up without a question. Why, there can't be any evidence against you.\"  \"There's no saying, mother,\" Reuben replied. \"You mustn't be too sure of that. Don't you remember that affair of the dog? Well, the same hand is at work now. Before, I only suspected who had done it; but I am sure now. However, whatever evidence they may have got, we know it isn't true. I have four years' good character here to speak for me. Still, it is hard that I should get into positions of this sort, without any fault of mine.\"  \"It's better that it is without any fault of yours, Reuben.\"  \"That is right enough, mother, so we will both keep up our spirits.\"    Chapter 4: The Trial.   There were three magistrates on the bench on the following morning, when Reuben was brought up. The justice room was crowded, for the series of burglaries had caused some excitement; and the news that the house of Mr. Ellison had been broken into, and that one of the men who had been taken turned out to belong to Lewes, had created quite a sensation.  Mr. Ellison was the first to give his evidence. He testified that, on waking on the previous morning, he found that someone had been in his room during the night. He was not in the habit of locking his door, and had not been awakened. He found that a box which stood on the dressing table, containing some valuable jewelry, was gone; that his watch and that of Mrs. Ellison had been taken; that the drawers had been opened, and a case containing the more valuable jewels of his wife had also been abstracted. This was not discovered till afterwards. He first missed his watch.  He rang the servants up, for it was still early; and it was then discovered that the lower premises had been broken into, the plate chest in the butler's pantry broken open, and a large quantity of plate stolen.  \"What do you estimate the value of the articles stolen, Mr. Ellison?\"  \"The value of my wife's jewels I should put down, roughly, at two thousand pounds; the silver plate might have been worth three hundred more; the watches and other articles, so far as I yet miss them, say another hundred.\"  The servants proved that they found the kitchen window open, on going downstairs. It had been opened by the catch being forced back. It was not the custom to put up shutters. The pantry door, which was a strong one, had been cut with a saw round the lock. The butler testified to the plate having been safe, the night before, and the strong chest in which it was kept having been forced open.  Directly it was discovered, the constable of the village was placed in charge of the room, with orders to admit no one; and a man on horseback was sent off to Lewes, to the chief constable. The village constable gave evidence as to the state of the place, when he was put in charge.  The constable who had been sent over from Lewes then stepped into the witness box. He testified to the marks of entry of the thieves, and said that the manner in which they had gone to work, and in which the door had been sawn through, and the chest forced open, seemed to show that it was the work of practised hands. On examining closely the butler's pantry, he found a powerful screwdriver and a heavy chisel. These corresponded to marks in the lid, and had evidently been used for the purpose of forcing it open. They had the initials \"R W.\" burnt in the handles. The inmates of the house all denied any knowledge of these tools.  Mr. Ellison had been present when he showed them to Mrs. Ellison. On looking at them she said at once:  \"R. W. Why, that must be Reuben Whitney, that wicked boy, again.\"  Upon making inquiries, he found that the man named worked at Mr. Penfold's, the mill wright at Lewes. He returned there at once and, going to Mr. Penfold, found the prisoner was absent from work. The men identified the brand on the tools as that of the prisoner. Another constable proved the arrest.  The chief constable then read the statement that the prisoner had made to him. The magistrates conferred together for a few minutes, in an undertone.  \"Mrs. Ellison,\" the senior of them said, addressing that lady, who was sitting on a chair placed at the upper end of the court, \"we are sorry to trouble you, but we must ask you to go into the witness box.  \"I wish to ask you,\" he went on, when she had taken her stand in the box, \"how it was you at once connected the initials with the prisoner?\"  \"Because he had at one time lived in the village, and was employed assisting our gardener. He was discharged on suspicion of having poisoned a watchdog which had bit him; and as the three dogs about the place had all been poisoned, on the night when the house was broken into, his name had been in my mind and, on seeing the initials, I naturally recognized them at once.\"  There was a deep silence in the court, when Mrs. Ellison gave her evidence. Hitherto the impression had been rather favourable to the prisoner. His story, though strange, had been by no means impossible and, if true, would have completely accounted for the finding of the tools, which were the only evidence against him. The evidence of Mrs. Ellison, however, entirely altered the complexion of the case.  Reuben had stood, quiet and composed, during the hearing. His countenance had evinced no surprise or emotion, when the tools were produced. He had, indeed, upon thinking the matter over before coming into court, come to the conclusion that the tools, which he had in a small basket at the time he was attacked, had been found in or near the house; having been left there purposely, by Tom Thorne, in order to throw suspicion upon him. Their production, therefore, was no surprise to him.  A slight shade had passed over his face when Mrs. Ellison entered the witness box. Glancing at the squire as she gave her evidence, Reuben saw that Mr. Ellison looked greatly vexed and annoyed. As before, at the conclusion of the evidence of each witness, Reuben was asked if he had any question to put. He hesitated for a moment and then, as before, replied in the negative.  Again the magistrates consulted together.  \"Mr. Ellison, we shall be obliged if you will enter the witness box again. In your former evidence, Mr. Ellison, you said nothing in any way relating to the prisoner; but it now seems you had a previous acquaintance with him. Will you tell the court what it is?\"  \"I have not much to say,\" the squire said. \"As a boy he lived in the village with his mother, a most respectable person; and widow of Jacob Whitney, a miller in a good way of business, who, as it may be in your memory, was found drowned in his mill pond some seven or eight years ago. The widow, being in reduced circumstances, settled in Tipping. The boy was an intelligent lad and, when the boy employed in my garden left, I gave him the place.  He gave every satisfaction. One day he was severely bitten by the watchdog and, three days later, the dog was found poisoned. My gardener saw a boy running away from the spot, a quarter of an hour before the dog died. He believed it to be the prisoner, but it was too dark for him to distinguish the features.  \"At the time, I certainly suspected that he had been guilty of poisoning the dog and, in spite of his denying that he had anything to do with it, as he was unable to account for where he was at the time the boy was seen, I discharged him. I wish to say publicly that I have deeply regretted having done so, ever since, and that I consider I acted hastily and wrongly in so doing. Considering his previous good character, I ought not to have assumed his guilt without more positive evidence than I had before me. I may also say that the schoolmaster of our village will give the prisoner the highest character for truthfulness, and he has known him ever since. His present employer, Mr. Penfold, is also, I believe, ready to testify to his excellent conduct during his four years of apprenticeship.\"  \"I suppose, Mr. Ellison,\" the senior magistrate said, \"you have not, at any time since the poisoning of the dog, obtained any actual evidence which would show that you were mistaken in your first view, and that your subsequent change of opinion was due solely to your general view of the boy's character, so far as you knew it.\"  \"That is so,\" the squire assented and, no further question being asked, he resumed his seat. His evidence had caused surprise and some little amusement in court. It was clear that there was a strong difference of opinion between him and his wife on the subject; and that, while the lady had something like an animus against the prisoner, the squire was strongly impressed in his favour. After some consultation, the magistrate said:  \"The case will be remanded until this day week, to see if further evidence is forthcoming; but I may say that, under the present circumstances of the case, we shall feel ourselves obliged to send it for trial. The prisoner's account of his proceedings, from the time he left Lewes on the previous evening up to that of his return and arrest here, may be true; but so far it is entirely unsupported. On the other hand, we have the evidence of the tools, admitted to belong to him, being found on the scene of the burglary. We have the further important fact that he had been formerly employed upon the place; and had, it may be supposed, some knowledge of the premises. He had been discharged upon a suspicion, rightfully or wrongly entertained, of his having poisoned a dog belonging to Mr. Ellison, and there is reason for the belief that the dogs poisoned before the burglary were got at by some one acquainted with the place.\"  \"Will it be any use my calling evidence as to character, at the next meeting?\" Reuben asked.  \"No,\" the magistrate said. \"Evidence of that kind will be useful at the trial, when the matter will be thoroughly sifted. We only have to decide that there is prima facie evidence connecting you with the offence, and of that there can be no doubt.\"  At the sitting a week later, no fresh evidence was produced; and Reuben was committed for trial at the next assizes. Public opinion in Lewes ran high on the subject of Reuben's guilt or innocence. The other workmen at the mill wright's were strongly in his favour--he was very popular among his fellows--and they pointed out that several hands must have been concerned in the business, that he was never seen about in public houses of an evening, or was likely to have any connection with bad characters. Was it probable, if he had gone about such a job as that, he would have taken tools marked with his own initials; or if he had, that he would have been fool enough to leave them behind?  Upon the other hand, opinion in general ran strongly against him. His story was declared to be utterly improbable, and a fellow who had once been dismissed for poisoning a dog would be likely, at any future time, to revenge himself upon the employer who turned him off. As to Mr. Ellison's declaration of his subsequent opinion that he acted hastily, little weight was attached to it. Everyone knew Squire Ellison was a kind-hearted man, and as he acknowledged himself that he had obtained no evidence which would satisfy him that he had acted wrongly in the first case, it was clear that it was from mere kindness of heart that he had changed his mind on the subject.  At Tipping the subject was never mentioned. The squire and Mrs. Ellison had, on the drive home, had the most serious quarrel which had ever taken place during their wedded life; which had ended by the former saying:  \"If anyone had ever told me before, Mary, that you were a vindictive woman, I should have knocked him down. I might do so now, but I should know in my heart that he had spoken truly. For some reason or other you took a prejudice against that boy, and you never forgave his mother for standing up in his defence. I was shocked, downright shocked, when you gave your evidence in court.\"  Mrs. Ellison had been too much offended to reply, and the rest of the drive had been passed in silence. Upon their return home the girls were full of eager questions, but the squire said shortly:  \"My dears, the less we talk about it, the better. Your mother and I differ entirely on the subject. She believes that Reuben Whitney is guilty. I am absolutely convinced he is innocent. Therefore, if you please, we will not discuss it.\"  The following morning Kate Ellison went down to the school house.  \"Mr. Shrewsbury,\" she said, putting her head in at the door, \"could you come out for two or three minutes? I want particularly to speak to you.  \"Have you heard what took place yesterday, at Lewes?\" she asked when he came out.  \"Yes, Miss Ellison. I saw Jones the constable last night, and he told me all that had been said in court.\"  \"And you think Reuben Whitney is innocent?\" she asked eagerly.  \"I am quite sure of it, Miss Ellison--as sure as I am of my own existence. For anyone who knows him to have a doubt is absolutely absurd. A finer young fellow than Reuben it would be hard to find.\"  \"But what did he say? How did he account for his tools being found there?\"  The schoolmaster repeated the account Reuben had given, and said:  \"When the trial comes off I shall, of course, go over; and testify both as to his general conduct and to the fact that he had, as he said, promised to bring over his tools to put up some shelves in my cupboards.\"  \"Do you think he will get off, Mr. Shrewsbury?\" she asked anxiously.  \"I should hope so, Miss Ellison, but I can't disguise from myself that it is by no means certain. That unfortunate old business about the dog will tell terribly against him; and though I am perfectly sure that his account of what took place is correct, there is nothing to confirm it. It is just the sort of story, they will say, that he would naturally get up to account for his absence, and for the tools being found. Of course, if the jury knew him as well as I do the result would be certain; but I have been trying to look at the facts as if he were a stranger, and I can't say what decision I should come to, in such a case. Still, of course, the high character that will be given him, and the fact that there is no evidence whatever connecting him, in any way, with bad characters, must count immensely in his favour.\"  The assizes were to take place only a fortnight after the date of Reuben's committal. Mrs. Whitney had engaged a lawyer in the town to defend her son and, to the surprise of this gentleman, Mr. Ellison called upon him two or three days later, and said:  \"Mr. Brogden, I hear that you have been engaged by Mrs. Whitney to defend her son. I don't believe the young fellow is guilty, and therefore I authorize you to spend any sum that may be necessary in getting up his defence; and I wish you to instruct a counsel to appear for him. Of course I cannot appear openly in the matter, and my name must not be mentioned, but I will guarantee all expenses.  \"It seems to me that it would be desirable to find out, if possible, the village where he says he breakfasted, and asked the way to Lewes. In his story he says he didn't know the name of the village but, as he was told it was about twenty miles from Lewes, and he can describe the road he followed, there ought to be no difficulty in finding it.  \"I should advise you to have a chat with Shrewsbury, the schoolmaster at Tipping. He is a great friend of the lad's, and a very intelligent fellow. He may be able to suggest some points to be followed up. At any rate, do all you can.\"  Reuben had another adherent who was also acting on his behalf. The afternoon before the trial, Kate Ellison stopped before the blacksmith shop in the village and, seeing that Jacob Priestley the smith was at work, alone, she entered.  \"Is it true, Jacob, that you have been summoned on the jury at Lewes tomorrow?\"  \"Yes, miss, it bee true, sureley. It be four years since anyone in the village was summoned, and it be mighty hard that they should have picked upon me. Still, I have never been called before, so I suppose I mustn't grumble; but it be hard to be taken away from work, to waste one's time in a court, and they say the 'sizes ull last for three days.\"  \"Well, Jacob, you know that Reuben Whitney is going to be tried for robbery at our house.\"  \"Yes, miss; so they says.\"  \"Well, what do you think about it, Jacob?\"  \"I don't think nothing one way or the other, miss. Most folks says as how he must have done it, 'cause as how he poisoned squire's dog afore.\"  \"He didn't do anything of the sort, Jacob; and it's very wicked of people to say so. He is innocent, quite innocent. I am sure he is, and papa is quite sure, too; and he will be terribly put out if he is found guilty. So I want you to promise me that, whatever the others think, you will hold out that he is innocent.\"  \"Well, miss,\" the smith said, scratching his head, \"if you be sure of it, and squire be sure, I suppose there can't be no doubt about it, for who should know better than squire; and I am sure I wouldn't go to put him about, for a better landlord than squire ain't to be found in the county. So you tell him, miss, as I will hold out.\"  \"But papa doesn't know that I have come down here, Jacob. It wouldn't do for him to interfere, you know; especially as he is a magistrate himself. You mustn't mention to anyone that I have spoken to you about it--not to anyone, Jacob, not even to your wife--but I can tell you the squire will be heartily pleased if he is found innocent, and he will be terribly put out if he is found guilty.\"  \"All right, miss,\" the smith replied. \"I understand, and no one sha'n't know as you have spoken to me aboot it. It be quite enough for I to know as the squire knows as he's innocent. It ain't likely as I should stick my opinion up against his.\"  The day after he heard of Reuben's arrest, the schoolmaster went over to see him; and as he was the bearer of a letter from Mr. Ellison to the governor of the jail, he was able to obtain admittance.  \"Was there ever such an unfortunate fellow as I am?\" Reuben exclaimed, after the first hearty greeting. \"Here am I for the second time accused of a crime of which I am innocent; and from which, indeed, in the present case I am a sufferer; and all this has come about, simply because I went out of my way to inquire into what seemed to me a suspicious business.\"  \"Tell me all about it, Reuben. I have heard the statement you made to the chief constable; but tell it me again, with every detail you can think of. Some circumstance, which appears to you as trifling, may furnish a clue.\"  \"I have seen Mr. Brogden, the lawyer. I have told him all that happened,\" Reuben said; \"but of course, I will gladly tell you again.\"  And Reuben repeated the story of the adventure, with every detail that he could think of; speaking slowly, as the schoolmaster wrote it down at length.  \"I will see what I can make of it, when I think it over,\" Mr. Shrewsbury said. \"Of course, as it stands, it is so natural and probable that it would clear you at once; had it not been for that unfortunate dog business before, and the supposition, excited by it, that you had a feeling of hostility to the squire. I shall be able partly to dispose of that, for I can swear that you have frequently spoken to me of the squire in tones of respect and liking; and that, although you regretted the manner in which you left his service, you felt no ill will against him on account of it. Moreover, I shall be able to prove that the reasons you gave for having your tools with you was a true one; and although I cannot swear that I expected you specially on that evening, the fact that you were in the habit of coming over, at times, to see me, cannot but corroborate your story.  \"I shall get leave for two or three days, and will hunt up the village where you breakfasted.\"  \"Thank you very much,\" Reuben said, \"though I have been thinking it over, and do not see that the evidence of the people at the public house would help me much. It will simply prove that I passed through there in the morning; but will not show, in any way, whether I went willingly as far as that, as one of the party who broke into the house, or whether I was taken there.\"  \"They can probably prove that you looked pale and exhausted,\" the schoolmaster said.  \"I fancy I should look pale, in any case,\" Reuben said, \"if I had gone through such a night's work as that of breaking into the squire's.\"  \"Well, keep up your courage, Reuben. You may be quite sure that your friends will do all in their power for you. I shall go now and have a chat with your mother. I am afraid that she will want comforting more than you do.\"  \"Yes,\" Reuben agreed, \"I am afraid so. Somehow I don't seem to take it to heart much. I shall feel it more afterwards, perhaps; but at present, the whole thing seems so extraordinary that I can't quite realize that I am in danger of being sent to Botany Bay. The worst of it is that, even if I am acquitted, lots of people will still think I am guilty. There is only one thing that can really prove my innocence, and that is the arrest of Tom Thorne, and his father.\"  \"I hear,\" the schoolmaster said, \"that the chief constable has written up to Bow Street, for them to put the runners on the traces of those two scoundrels. Whether they believe your story or not, it is quite evident that more than one person was concerned in the affair. Their theory, of course, is that you quarrelled with the others over the division of the spoil; and got that knock on the head, which is a very severe one. I went down yesterday with Jones, to see the spot where you said you were assaulted. There were marks where the horse stopped, and marks of feet in the field, and a patch of blood; all of which goes to prove that your story may be true, but unfortunately it doesn't prove that it was because, according to the theory against you, you might have been assaulted after the robbery, as well as before it.\"  \"But in that case,\" Reuben said, \"why should they have taken the trouble to carry me twenty miles away?\"  \"Yes, there is of course that question,\" the schoolmaster said thoughtfully; \"but then, on the other hand, why did they take the trouble in case you were not an accomplice? In both cases the answer is the same--they did it to prevent your giving the alarm, until they had got far away from the scene. They didn't like to murder you, because of the consequences to themselves; but they would not risk your recovering consciousness and getting up an early pursuit. It cuts both ways, you see.\"  \"So it does,\" Reuben assented. \"It's just a question of belief; and I own, myself, that that old dog business is very much against me; and that I can't blame anyone who considers me guilty.\"  Reuben's was the last case taken at the assizes, and occasioned a good deal of interest in that part of Sussex, partly owing to the position of Squire Ellison, partly to the nature of the defence set up, as to which opinion was a good deal divided. The evidence for the prosecution was, to a great extent, similar to that given at the inquiry before the magistrates. Unfortunately for Reuben, the judge was notoriously a severe one; and his bias, from the first, appeared to be against the prisoner. Mr. Ellison was closely questioned by the prosecutor as to the poisoning of his dog, as this was considered to show a particular animus on the part of Reuben. He again repeated his conviction of Reuben's innocence in that affair.  \"But what reason have you, Mr. Ellison,\" the counsel for the prosecution asked blandly, \"for changing your opinion on the subject?\"  This was just the question which the squire could not answer satisfactorily; and was a particularly irritating one, because it had often been triumphantly asked by his wife.  \"I can really give no particular reason,\" he said, \"except that, on reflection, the boy's previous character and antecedents convinced me that he could not have done such an act.\"  \"In fact,\" the counsel said suavely, \"you were influenced by your own goodness of heart, Mr. Ellison, in thus laying aside a conviction which the facts had, at the time, forced upon you.\"  \"I don't look upon it in that light,\" the squire replied shortly. \"I consider that in the first instance I acted hastily and unadvisedly, and on consideration I saw that I had done so.\"  \"I am afraid, Mr. Ellison,\" the counsel said, \"that you will not persuade the jury to agree with you.\"  \"I have only one or two questions to ask you,\" the counsel for the defence said, when he rose to cross-examine, \"for indeed your evidence is, as I think the jury will agree, altogether in favour of the prisoner. In the first place, was the lad, when in your employment, ever upstairs in your house?\"  \"Not that I know of,\" the squire replied. \"Certainly in the course of his duties he would never be there. Indeed, it would be very seldom that he would even enter the kitchen, except to bring in vegetables. Certainly he would never pass through to go upstairs. He could not possibly have done so without exciting attention and remarks.\"  \"He would therefore, Mr. Ellison, have no means of possessing any knowledge as to the internal arrangements of your house, beyond that possessed by the other people in the village?\"  \"None whatever,\" Mr. Ellison replied.  \"Now, as to that unfortunate affair of the poisoning of your dog. Your opinion, as to the innocence of the prisoner in that matter, is not a recent one--not the outcome of his after good conduct and character?\"  \"Not at all,\" Mr. Ellison said. \"I changed my opinion on the matter very shortly, indeed, after the affair.\"  \"Within a few days, I think I may say?\" the counsel asked.  \"Within a very few days; I may almost say within a few hours,\" the squire replied. \"The boy's story, told not to me but to another, that he believed the dog was poisoned by another lad in the village who owed him a grudge, and who has since turned out an exceedingly bad character, struck me as being very much more probable than that he should do it, himself.\"  Mrs. Ellison was next called. Her evidence as to the robbery was a mere repetition of that given by the squire. The counsel then turned to the question of the poisoning.  \"I would rather say nothing about it,\" Mrs. Ellison said. \"It is a matter which has been productive of much pain to me, and I would rather say nothing about it.\"  \"But you must, madam,\" the judge said sharply. \"You are here to answer any question which may enable the jury to form an opinion on this case.\"  \"I am sorry to press you, Mrs. Ellison,\" the counsel continued, \"but I really must do so. You took a different opinion to that held by your husband?\"  \"I regret to say that I did. Mr. Ellison told me the reasons he had for suspecting the boy. I thought those reasons sufficient, and have seen no cause for changing my opinion.\"  After the evidence for the prosecution had been given, the counsel for the defence pointed out that there was, in fact, no evidence whatever connecting Reuben with the robbery, beyond the discovery of his tools on the premises; and that, as to this trumpery story of the poisoning a dog, four years before, apparently only for the purpose of showing some sort of animus, he regarded it as altogether contemptible. When a man meant to commit a burglary in a house, he did so in order to obtain possession of the goods, and not from any spite against the owner. Had this young fellow felt any malice, for this ridiculous charge on which he had been dismissed, he would not have allied himself with burglars to rob the house; but would probably have vented his spite in the usual fashion, by setting fire to a stack or outhouse; but so far as he could see, there was no foundation for the charge brought against him, and they had already heard Mr. Ellison declare that he regretted he had suspected him, and that he believed him to be innocent.  But even had it been proved, up to the hilt, that the prisoner had poisoned the dog, he should still hold it as wholly unconnected with the present matter. If he had poisoned the dog, what then? It was not a heinous sin, nor would it affect his moral character. No boy likes having a piece taken out of his calf by a savage dog, and there would have been nothing so very dreadful had he revenged himself. It was probable that, even among the jury, there was one or more who, if he had not absolutely set poison for his neighbour's cats, for destroying his young chickens or scratching up his flower beds, had threatened to do so, and would not have regarded it as a very serious crime had he done so.  Therefore he contended that the jury should put this trumpery affair altogether out of their minds; on the double ground that, in the first place, the prisoner at the bar did not poison the dog; and that, had he done so, it would have had nothing whatever to do with the present affair.  \"Why, gentlemen,\" he said, \"it is an insult to your understanding to ask you to credit that this young fellow--whose character, which I shall presently prove to you, by unimpeachable evidence, is of the highest kind--has, for four years, cherished such malice against his employer, for dismissing him mistakenly, that he has become the consort of thieves and burglars, has stained his hands in crime, and rendered himself liable to transportation, for the purpose merely of spiting that gentleman. Such a contention would be absolutely absurd. I must beg you to dismiss it altogether from your mind, and approach it from a different standpoint, altogether. Divested of this extraneous business, the matter is a most simple one.  \"The prisoner left his mother's cottage, at seven o'clock in the evening, to go over for an hour or two to his friend Mr. Shrewsbury, the schoolmaster of Tipping. He took with him a few tools, as he had promised to put some shelves in his friend's house. On the way he heard some talking down a lane, which he knew led to only a field. Thinking it strange, he went to see who it was and, some distance down, he found a horse and cart standing and, listening to the conversation of two men who were sitting under the hedge, he heard enough to inform him that a burglary was intended upon the house of Mr. Ellison. He was about to make off to give the alarm, when he was suddenly attacked by some men who had come up behind, and was felled to the ground. While lying insensible, he was bound hand and foot and left in a ditch; where he remained till the burglars returned from completing the work on hand. They then threw him into the cart, and put him down some twenty miles away. Being greatly exhausted by loss of blood, it was late in the afternoon before he arrived at Lewes, when he was at once arrested.  \"This, gentlemen, is the prisoner's story, as related to the chief constable when he was taken to the lockup. Nothing can be simpler or more probable; and in some points, at least, I shall be able to confirm it by independent testimony. Mr. Shrewsbury will tell you that the prisoner had arranged to come over to see him, and bring his tools. He will also tell you that, two days after the prisoner's arrest, he went with Jones, the village constable, and found the marks where the horse and trap had stood; while, just inside the field, the grass was trampled with feet; and in the bottom of the dry ditch was a great dark patch, which he was able to ascertain to be blood. Doctor Hewitt will tell you that he was called in to strap up the prisoner's head, after his arrest; and that the cut was a very severe one, and must have been inflicted by a heavy weapon, with great force.  \"I am convinced, gentlemen, that after hearing this evidence you will agree with me, not only that the prisoner is perfectly innocent of the charge, but that he is a most ill-used person; and that it is a matter of surprise and regret that the magistrates should have committed him for trial, when the only shadow of evidence against him was the discovery of these tools, a discovery which he at once explained. Of other evidence, there is not one jot or tittle. No attempt has been made to prove that the prisoner was in the habit of consorting with bad characters; no attempt has been made to show any connection, whatever, between him and the men who came in a horse and trap across the hills, for the purpose of effecting a burglary at Mr. Ellison's; and who, as we know, did effect it. No scrap of the property stolen from the house has been found upon him and, in order to account for the severe wound on his head, the counsel for the prosecution has started the hypothesis that it was given in the course of a quarrel, during the division of the plunder.  \"But had that been the case, gentlemen, the prisoner would not have been standing here alone. Robbed and ill-treated by these companions of his, he would naturally have put the officers of justice on their track and, as he must have been in communication with them, and well acquainted with their ways and haunts, he could have given information which would have led to their early arrest. He could well have done this, for the crown would have made no difficulty, whatever, in promising a lad like this a free pardon, on condition of his turning evidence against these burglars; whose mode of procedure shows them to have been old hands, and who are, no doubt, the same who have committed the various robberies which have lately taken place in this part of the country.  \"The prisoner is the son of highly respectable parents. His employer will come before you, and give you evidence of the extremely high character he bears. Mr. Shrewsbury will tell you that he has, for the last four years, devoted no inconsiderable portion of his leisure time to improve his education, and enable him to recover the position occupied by his father, who was a much-respected miller in this neighbourhood. I shall leave the case in your hands, gentlemen, with an absolute confidence that you will, without a moment's hesitation, find a verdict proclaiming the innocence of my client; and enable him to leave the dock, without a stain upon his character.\"    Chapter 5: Not Guilty!   The schoolmaster was the first witness called for the defence. After stating that, although no evening was actually settled for his coming over, he expected the prisoner one evening that week; and that he had promised to bring his tools over, to do a little job of carpentering; he also detailed his visit to the lane, and the result of his observation there; and then gave Reuben the highest character, saying that he had known him for five years, and that he had an absolute confidence in his integrity and honesty.  \"He has from the first,\" he said, \"proved a most intelligent and hard-working boy, anxious to improve himself and to get on in the world. He has learnt all that I could teach him, and more. He is one of the last persons in the world whom I should consider capable of the crime with which he is charged. As to his having any animosity to Mr. Ellison, I can swear that, on many different occasions, he has expressed his high opinion of him; and has declared that it was quite natural that, with the evidence before him, he should have thought him guilty of poisoning the dog.\"  The keeper of the wayside public house, where he had breakfasted, proved that he was struck with the prisoner's appearance when he entered; that he was very pale, and seemed scarcely able to walk. He had asked him the nearest way to Lewes, and had inquired whether there was any chance of getting a lift; as he was anxious to get back, as soon as possible.  Mr. Penfold was the next witness. He said that the prisoner had been apprenticed to him, four years previously; that his general conduct had been most excellent, and that he was remarkably quick and intelligent, and was an excellent workman. During the time that he had been employed, he had never lost a day.  \"At the time he was apprenticed to you, Mr. Penfold,\" Reuben's counsel asked, \"were you aware that the lad had been summarily discharged by Mr. Ellison?\"  \"I was aware of that fact,\" Mr. Penfold answered; and Reuben, with surprise, looked at his employer.  \"From whom did you hear of it?\"  \"I heard of it from Mr. Ellison himself, who called upon me about the matter.\"  \"How was it he came to call upon you, Mr. Penfold?\"  \"The prisoner's mother had applied to me about apprenticing her son. I had asked 50 pounds premium, and said that it wasn't my custom to pay any wages for the first year. She said she could only afford 20 pounds, and I thought that was an end of the matter until, a few days later, Mr. Ellison called upon me, and said that he had heard from the schoolmaster in his village, who was a friend of the boy's mother, how matters stood; and that her application had fallen through, owing to her being unable to find more than 20 pounds.  \"I said that this was so. Mr. Ellison then said that he was prepared to make up the deficiency, that he had a regard for the boy's father; and that, moreover, he himself had, through a hasty misconception regarding the poisoning of the dog, discharged the lad from his service; and that he felt uneasy, in his mind, at having been guilty of a piece of injustice. Over and above the 30 pounds, he gave me six pound ten; in order that I might pay the boy half a crown a week, for the first year, which he said would be a matter of consequence to his mother. He requested me on no account to let Mrs. Whitney know that he had intervened in the matter, but to represent that I changed my mind, and was willing to take the 20 pounds she offered as a premium. He was particularly anxious on this point; because, he said, she would certainly refuse to accept assistance from him, owing to that unfortunate affair about the dog.  \"I may say that, from that time to this, I have not mentioned the fact to anyone; and the sum of 20 pounds was inserted in the indenture of apprenticeship.\"  There was a little movement of applause in the court, as Mr. Penfold gave his evidence; and Reuben looked gratefully towards Mr. Ellison, and said heartily:  \"I thank you, sir, with all my heart.\"  The foreman of the yard was next examined. He confirmed the high character Mr. Penfold had given Reuben, and adding that he knew the lad never entered a public house, but spent his evenings almost entirely at home studying; for that he himself had, many times, called in and had, upon every occasion, found him so employed.  The counsel for the prosecution then addressed the jury, and threw discredit upon Reuben's narrative; which, he said, was unsupported in any material particular. That he met the rest of the party in the lane was likely enough. He may have returned there with them after the burglary, and probably it was there that, in a quarrel over the spoil, he received the blow of which you have heard.  \"My learned friend has told you to dismiss from your mind the question about that poisoning of the dog, four years ago; but it is impossible for you to do so. You have heard that the dog was poisoned, and that the evidence was so strong that his employer at once dismissed him. It is true that Mr. Ellison has told you that he afterwards changed his mind on the subject; but after the evidence which Mr. Penfold has given, of the kindness of that gentleman's heart, you will readily understand that no great stress can be laid upon this. The matter, so far from being trivial, as my friend represents it, is highly important; inasmuch as here we find that, again, the dogs have been poisoned just as on the first occasion. It is clear that burglars from London would be ignorant of the whereabouts of the kennels, and were not likely to have come down provided with a store of poisoned meat; had they not known, from persons well acquainted with the place, of the steps that would have to be taken before an entry could be effected into the house. You will therefore see the extreme importance of this point.  \"I am perfectly ready to admit that the evidence is of a wholly circumstantial nature but, from the nature of the case, it is necessary that this should be so. Had Mrs. or Mr. Ellison awoke, when the thieves entered their room, it is probable that much more evidence would be forthcoming. It is, however, for you to weigh the probabilities of the case. You have to consider whether the theory which I have laid before you, as to the connection of the prisoner with this affair, or this wild story which he tells you, is the most probable.\"  The judge then summed up, with a strong bias against Reuben. He told them that evidence for character was, of course, of importance; but that it must not be relied upon too far. The prisoner appeared undoubtedly to be intelligent and well-conducted, but unfortunately his experience told him that many criminals were men of unusual intelligence. Stress had been laid, by the counsel for the defence, upon the fact that the prisoner was not known, at any time, to have consorted with suspicious characters; but this, after all, was only negative evidence. Affairs of this sort were always conducted with secrecy and, had one of these men come down from London, as was probable enough, to make inquiries as to houses which could be broken into with a prospect of good booty, he would naturally not make himself conspicuous.  They had heard the two stories, and must judge for themselves; but he agreed, with the counsel for the prosecution, that the fact that the prisoner had been discharged by Mr. Ellison for poisoning a dog, and that on the night of the robbery other dogs were found poisoned, and that probably by some one acquainted with the locality, could not but have an influence upon their minds. At the same time he would tell them that, if they had a doubt in their minds, it was their duty to give the prisoner the benefit of that doubt.  The jury consulted together for a minute or two in the jury box, and then expressed their desire to retire. A buzz of talk arose in the court, when they had left. Opinion was divided as to what the verdict would be. When the counsel for the defence sat down, the general opinion was that the prisoner would be certainly acquitted; but the speech of the counsel for the prosecution, and the summing up of the judge, had caused a reaction, and few doubted now that the verdict would be guilty.  So Reuben himself thought. It was he felt hard that, standing there to be tried for burglary, the decision should, in fact, depend upon that unjust charge which had, four years ago, been brought against him. Reuben was in the habit of what he called arguing things out by himself; and as he stood there, waiting for the verdict, he tried to put himself in the position of the jury; and he felt that, in that case, he should have difficulty in coming to a decision.  It was not until after the lamps had been lighted that the jury returned into the box. The crier shouted for order, and there was not a sound heard, as the foreman told the judge that they were not agreed upon their verdict.  \"Then you must go back, gentlemen, until you are,\" the judge said.  \"We are eleven one way, and one the other. Won't that do, my lord?\"  \"No, sir,\" the judge replied. \"You must be unanimous.\"  The jury again retired, the judge and counsel went off to dine at the hotel, and almost all the public trooped out. Two hours later, as the jury did not return, Reuben Whitney was taken back to the jail, and the court closed. At nine o'clock in the morning, a warder entered.  \"The jury have come back into the court,\" he said. \"They are going to return a verdict.\"  Reuben was again placed in the dock. The seats open to the public quickly filled, as the news spread through the town. Several of the members of the bar dropped in, and then the judge came in and took his seat.  Reuben had occupied the time in trying to judge, from the faces of the jury, what their verdict was going to be. They looked sulky and tired. But as Reuben's eye rested on Jacob Priestley, whom he had at once recognized among the jury, the smith gave him an encouraging wink. At least, so Reuben thought; but as the next moment he was looking as surly as the rest, he thought that he must have been mistaken.  \"Are you agreed, gentlemen, as to the verdict you find in this case?\" the judge asked.  \"We are, my lord,\" the foreman replied.  \"Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?\"  \"Not guilty, my lord.\"  \"Very well, gentlemen,\" the judge said tartly. \"It is your verdict, not mine.\"  At the foreman's word a thrill had run through the court; for when it was known, the evening before, that eleven were one way and one the other, the belief had been general that the majority were for a conviction. Reuben himself had so understood it, and the verdict was a complete surprise to him.  [Illustration: Reuben Whitney Acquitted of the Charge of Burglary]  The constable raised the bar for him to leave the dock, and as he moved out his friend the schoolmaster pushed forward, and shook him warmly by the hand.  \"Thank God for that verdict, Reuben. I am indeed rejoiced, and I own I hardly expected it.\"  \"I didn't expect it at all,\" Reuben said in a choked voice, for his sudden liberation had shaken him, more than his arrest or any of the subsequent proceedings had done.  \"I congratulate you heartily, Reuben,\" Mr. Ellison said, putting his hand on his shoulder.  The squire had waited at Lewes until ten o'clock on the previous evening, and had driven over again the first thing in the morning, so anxious was he about the verdict.  \"I didn't believe you guilty this time, my boy, from the first. I was glad indeed to hear the verdict; for after the judge's summing up, I was sorely uneasy.  \"And now, Reuben, I hope,\" he said, as they entered the street, \"that you have quite forgiven me for that old business. It has been the unfortunate cause of getting you into this affair. Had it not been for that no one would ever, for a moment, have doubted the truth of your story.\"  \"There is nothing to forgive, squire,\" Reuben said. \"I never blamed you for it, from the first; and even had I done so, your goodness, of which I only heard yesterday, would have made up, many times, for any mistake you may have made then.\"  \"That is right, my lad,\" the squire said. \"I am glad that matter is made up. And now I will not keep you, for I know you will want to be off home to your mother.\"  Reuben walked quietly home, so as to give the schoolmaster, who had hurried on ahead, time to break the news of his acquittal to his mother. Mrs. Whitney had remained in court during the trial, but had retired when the jury left to consider their verdict, being completely overcome with agitation and excitement. The schoolmaster had slept in the house, and had persuaded her not to go to the court in the morning; fearing as he did that the verdict would be a hostile one. She completely broke down when she was told the news, and was still sobbing when Reuben arrived.  The schoolmaster at once took his leave, leaving mother and son together; and promised them to return in a day or two. When he again came over, he saw at once that Mrs. Whitney was looking depressed and unhappy.  \"What do you think, Mr. Shrewsbury? Reuben says that he shall go abroad, out to Australia. I have talked against it till I am hoarse, but it's no good. I hope you will persuade him to give up such a mad idea.\"  \"I will hear what he has to say first, Mrs. Whitney. Reuben has generally a good deal to say for his side of a question, and I must hear his reasons before I can argue against them.  \"Now, Reuben, what have you to say for yourself?\"  \"I made up my mind while I was in jail,\" Reuben replied, \"that if I was acquitted, I would go right away. These things stick to a man all through his life. That first affair, four years ago, nearly got me transported now; and if a small matter like that did me such harm, what will this do? If I had been proved to be innocent, it would have been different; but as it is, I believe nine people out of ten in court thought I was guilty; and I am convinced that the jury were eleven to one against me, only the twelfth was more obstinate than they were, and so they gave in. I believe it was Jacob Priestley the blacksmith who held out, for the sake of old times.  \"At any rate, a great many people will think me guilty, all their lives, unless something turns up to prove my innocence. Mother says we might settle somewhere else, where we ain't known; but I should never feel safe. Years on, someone from Lewes might see me and tell the story; or Tom Thorne might keep on my track. I won't risk it.  \"I have been to Mr. Penfold, and he says if I am determined to go, he will cancel my indenture for me. I have no doubt I shall find work of some sort, out there. I am a pretty good workman now at my own craft and, if I can't get work at that, I can turn my hand to something else.  \"My only trouble is about mother. I want her to go with me. I could make a living for her out there, but she won't have it. She says six months at sea will kill her, and then she has all sorts of ideas in her head about the natives. However I hope that, in two or three years' time, I shall be able to write and tell her that I have comfortably settled, and have a good home ready for her to come to; and that then she will join me.\"  \"Never,\" Mrs. Whitney said, excitedly. \"I was born at Lewes, and I have lived near it all my days, and I will die here. I am not going to tramp all over the world, and settle down among black people, in outlandish parts. I could not do it, Mr. Shrewsbury. It's cruel of him to ask me.\"  The schoolmaster was silent for a minute. He saw that Reuben's mind was firmly made up, and he could not deny the force of his reasoning. It was true that many people still considered him guilty. It was true that this story might crop up again, years on, and ruin his life. It did seem that the best thing he could do was to leave the country.  \"Australia is not so bad a place as you fancy, Mrs. Whitney,\" he said at last. \"They do have troubles with the natives, certainly, in the outlying settlements; but in the towns you have no more trouble than you have here. Besides, every year the white population is increasing, and the black diminishing. Six months' voyage is not so dreadful as it seems. And though I do think that, if Reuben goes out, it will be better for you to remain quietly here till he has a home prepared for you, I think that, when the time comes, you will change your mind about it.  \"As to Reuben himself, I must own there's a good deal of force in what he says; and that until those Thornes have been sent out of the country, his story might follow him. And I have no doubt he would do well out there. He is a good workman for his age and, as he says, can turn his hand to almost anything. Labour is scarce out there and, as he has got his head screwed on the right way, I have no doubt that he will fall on his feet.\"  \"I didn't expect this of you, Mr. Shrewsbury,\" Mrs. Whitney said, beginning to cry. \"I thought you would have taken my part, and now you are going right against me.\"  \"Not against you, Mrs. Whitney, for I think that Reuben's plan is best for you both. He cannot but suffer, if he remains here; and you will be unhappy in seeing him suffer. Great as the loss would be to you, I believe that you would be happier here, alone, than you would be were you to see him in constant trouble and worry. At any rate you would have the option, if you found life intolerably dull here, of joining him out there at any time.  \"But how do you intend to get out, Reuben?\" he asked, seeing that Mrs. Whitney made no answer, but again relapsed into tears.  \"I shall work my way out,\" Reuben replied. \"I can do any rough work as a smith or a carpenter, and I should think I ought to get my passage for my work. Anyhow, I have got twelve pounds saved up; and if I can't get out free, that and my work ought to take me.\"  In a short time Mrs. Whitney, finding that Reuben was not to be shaken in his determination, ceased to oppose it; and began to busy herself in preparations for his departure, which he had arranged to take place as soon as possible.  A day or two before starting, he walked over to say goodbye to Mrs. Shrewsbury. He stopped as he passed the smithy and, seeing Jacob Priestley at work alone, he went in.  \"Ah, Reuben, is it you?\" the smith said. \"Better here than in the dock at Lewes, eh? I hears a talk of your going to foreign parts.\"  \"Yes, I am off,\" Reuben said, \"and I have just come over to say goodbye to Mrs. Shrewsbury; so I looked in as I passed, knowing as you were one of those who found me not guilty, and would perhaps give me a shake of the hand, before leaving.\"  \"That will I, lad. Yes, I found you not guilty; and I jest tipped you a wink, from the box, to let you know as it were all right; but my eye! what a game we had had of it. Never had such a game, in all my born days.\"  And the blacksmith sat down on a stool, to indulge in a great fit of laughing.  \"What was the game?\" Reuben asked.  \"Well, you know, Stokes he was the foreman, and a Cockney sort of chap he be. He turns round in the box and, says he:  \"'In course you are all agreed.'  \"'Agreed as how?' says I.  \"'Why, agreed as he's guilty, in course,' says he.  \"'Nothing of the sort,' says I. 'I believes he's as innocent as a child unborn.'  \"Then they all comes round me and jaws; but seeing as I wasn't going to give in, Stokes he asked the judge for leave to retire.  \"Well, when we retires they all pitches into me, and says as it's monstrous one man should hold out agin eleven; and that, even if I didn't feel sure myself, I ought to go as the others went. So I didn't say much, but I sits myself down and brings out a big chunk of bread and bacon, as my good woman had put into my pocket, and I begins to eat.  \"'Look you here,' says I, 'I ha' got four parcels like this. Today be Friday, and I can hold on easy till Tuesday. That's how I looks at it. This young chap ain't had nothing to do with this 'ere robbery, and I ain't going to see he transported for what he never done.'  \"Well, there we sits. Sometimes they would all talk at once, sometimes two or three of them would give it me. Ten o'clock comes and they got desperate like, for only one or two of them had put anything into their pockets, thinking that the matter was sure to be finished that night. When the messages were sent out again, as we couldn't agree, I sits down in a corner and, says I:  \"'I ain't a selfish man, and any of you as changes your mind can have a share of what I have got.'  \"I dozes off, but I hears them jawing away among themselves. It might have been two o'clock when one of them comes to me and gives me a shake and, says he:  \"'Give us a cut of that bread and bacon. I am well-nigh starved. I have got a wife and children to think of, and it don't matter to me whether this chap goes to Botany Bay, or whether he don't. It didn't seem to me a certain case, all along, so I will go along with you.'  \"Gradually two or three more comes, and when it got light I could see as some more was hesitating so, says I:  \"'Lookee here, my friends. Those who has agreed to give this young chap another chance has lessened my stock of bread and bacon pretty considerable, and I ain't got more than enough for one more, so who's the next?'  \"Four more spoke out at once. I divides the bread and bacon among them; then, as there was nine of us agin three, we goes at them and tells them how wrong it is as we was all to suffer from their obstinacy, and we works on their feelings about their wives and children; and then, says I:  \"'I call it downright ridiculous, when there's a hot breakfast on twelve tables waiting for us, as three men should keep the rest from tucking in, just acause they won't give an innocent lad the benefit of the doubt.'  \"Well, that finished them. The thought of the hot breakfast made the other chaps so ravenous as I believe they would have pitched into Stokes and the other two, if they hadn't have given in. So they comes round, and we sends out to say that we had agreed on the vardict. It were the best game I ever seed in my life.\"  \"Well, Jacob, I am sure I am heartily grateful to you, and I shall not forget your kindness; though what made you so sure of my innocence, while all the others doubted it, I don't know.\"  \"Lor', Reuben!\" the smith said, \"There ain't nothing to thank me about. I didn't know nowght as to whether you was innocent or guilty; and it was a good job for me as I had made up my mind about that there vardict, afore I went into court; for I should never have made head or tail of all that talk, and the fellows with white hair on the top of their heads as kept bobbing up and down, and asking all sorts of questions, was enough to turn an honest man's head. The question was settled when Miss Kate Ellison--that's the little un, you know--came in here. Says she:  \"'Jacob, you are on this jury, I hear.'  \"'Yes, miss,' says I.  \"'Well, I hope you are going to find Reuben Whitney innocent,' says she.  \"'I don't know nothing about it,' says I. 'Folks seem to think as he did it.'  \"Then she went at me, and told me that she was sure you was innocent; and the squire he was sure, and he would be moighty put out if you was found guilty. So I told her natural that, the squire's being a good landlord, I wouldn't disoblige him on no account; and she might look upon it as good as settled that you should be found innocent. So she tells me not to say a word to anyone, and I ain't, not even to the ould woman; but in course, I don't consider as she meant you.\"  Reuben could not help laughing as he learned that he had been acquitted, not from any belief in his innocence on the part of the jury, but by the intervention on his behalf of the girl who had, before, fought his battles. Shaking hands with Jacob, he went on to the schoolmaster's.  As he was sitting there chatting with Mr. and Mrs. Shrewsbury, he saw Kate Ellison come out of her father's gate along the road with her basket, as usual. Catching up his hat, he ran out and stood bareheaded, awaiting her.  \"Ah, Reuben!\" she said, with a smile and a nod, \"I am glad to see you before you go; for Mr. Shrewsbury told me, yesterday, you were going to leave Lewes and emigrate. I am glad,\"--and she hesitated a little--\"very glad that they found you innocent. I was quite sure you would not do such a thing.\"  \"I am glad I came over today, Miss Ellison,\" Reuben said quietly. \"Very glad that I have met you; for I have just learned, from Jacob Priestley, that it is to you I am indebted that I am not, in the present moment, a prisoner in jail, under sentence of transportation.\"  The girl flushed up hotly.  \"Jacob Priestley is very wrong to have spoken about it. I told him he was never to mention it.\"  \"I hope you will not blame him, Miss Ellison. He told me he had never spoken a word to anyone else, but he thought you did not mean it to apply to me. I am very glad he has spoken; for I shall carry away with me, across the sea, a deep gratitude, which will last as long as I live, for the kindness you have shown me; not only now, but always--kindness which has saved me from a terrible punishment, for an offence of which I was innocent.  \"May God bless you, Miss Ellison, and render your life a happy one.\"  \"Goodbye, Reuben,\" the girl said, gently. \"I hope you may do well, in the new land you are going to.\"  So saying, she went on her errand. Reuben stood watching her, until she entered one of the cottages. Then, putting on his cap, he returned to the schoolmaster's.  A week later Reuben was wandering along the side of the London Docks, looking at the vessels lying there, and somewhat confused at the noise and bustle of loading and unloading that was going on. He had come up the night before by the carrier's waggon, and had slept at the inn where it stopped. His parting with his mother had been a very sad one, but Mrs. Whitney had so far come round as to own that she thought that his plan was perhaps the best; although she still maintained that she should never venture, herself, upon so distant a journey. He had promised that, should she not change her mind on this point, he would, whether successful or not, come home to see her.  The squire had driven over, the day before he left, to say goodbye to him. He had, through Mr. Shrewsbury, directly he heard that he was going, offered to help towards paying his passage money; but this offer Reuben had gratefully, though firmly, declined to accept.  \"Well, Reuben, I wish you every good luck on your adventure,\" he said. \"The place you are going to will be a great country, one of these days; and you are just the fellow to make your way in it. I am sorry you wouldn't let me help you; because I am in a way, you know, at the bottom of this business which has driven you from home.\"  \"Thank you, squire, for your kind intention,\" Reuben answered; \"but I am so much in your debt, now, that I would rather not go further into it. I am old enough now to make my own way in life. My only regret in the matter is that I cannot persuade my mother to go with me.\"  \"I think she is right, Reuben,\" the squire replied. \"You can transplant a young tree, easily enough; but you can't an old one. Somehow they won't take root in new soil.  \"Well, lad, I wish you every success. I suppose I shall hear through Shrewsbury, from time to time, how you are going on.\"  As Reuben walked along the dock, he stopped to read the notices of their destination, affixed to the shrouds of most of the vessels. He had already gone on board three or four, which were loading for Australia, but in none was there a vacancy for a carpenter. He stopped before a fine-looking barque, to which no notice was attached.  \"Where is she going to?\" he asked a sailor, who was passing along the gangway to the shore.  \"She's bound for Sydney,\" the sailor said. \"She warps out of dock tonight, and takes on board a cargo of prisoners in the Medway.\"  \"Do you mean men sentenced for transportation?\" Reuben asked.  \"Yes,\" the man said, \"and I wish she had any other sort of cargo. I have been out with such a load before, and I would as soon go with a cargo of wild beasts.\"  Reuben felt a sudden chill, as he thought how narrow had been his escape of forming one of a similar party. However, he stepped on board, and went up to the mate, who was superintending the cargo.  \"Do you want a carpenter for the voyage out?\"  \"A carpenter!\" the mate repeated. \"Well yes, we do want a carpenter. The man who was to have gone has been taken ill. But you are too young for the berth. Why, you don't look more than eighteen; besides, you don't look like a carpenter.\"  \"I am a mill wright,\" Reuben said, \"and am capable of doing any ordinary jobs, either in carpentering or smith work. I have testimonials here from my late employers.\"  \"Well, you can see the captain, if you like,\" the mate said. \"You will find him at Mr. Thompson's office, in Tower Street, Number 51.\"  Reuben at once made his way to the office. The captain refused, at first, to entertain the application on the ground of his youth; but ship's carpenters were scarce, the time was short, and there was a difficulty in obtaining men for convict ships. Therefore, after reading the very warm testimonial as to character and ability which Mr. Penfold had given Reuben, he agreed to take him, on the terms of his working his passage.  Reuben went back at once, to the inn where he had stopped, and had his chest taken down to the docks; and went on board the Paramatta which, at high water, warped out of dock into the stream.    Chapter 6: On The Voyage.   The next day the Paramatta weighed anchor and proceeded down the river. Reuben had no time to look at the passing ships, for he was fully occupied with the many odd jobs which are sure to present themselves, when a ship gets under weigh. The wind was favourable, and the Paramatta ran down to the mouth of the Medway before the tide had ceased to ebb. She anchored for three hours, and then made her way up to Chatham, where she brought up close to the government yard.  It was not till late in the evening that Reuben had finished his work, and was at liberty to look round, and to take an interest in what was going on on deck.  \"This is your first voyage, my lad, I reckon,\" an old sailor, who was standing leaning against the bulwark, smoking his pipe, remarked.  \"Yes,\" Reuben said cheerfully, \"this is my first voyage. I have shipped as carpenter, you know, to work my way out to Sydney.\"  \"You could not have chosen a better ship than this 'ere barkee,\" the sailor said; \"though I wish she hadn't got them convicts on board. She will sail all the faster, 'cause, you see, instead of being choked up with cargo, the deck below there has been set aside for them. That will make easy sailing and quick sailing; but I don't like them, for all that. They are a lot of trouble, and they has to be watched, night and day. There's never no saying what they might be up to; there's mostly trouble on board, with them. Then one can't help being sorry for the poor chaps, though they does look such a villainous bad lot. They are treated mostly like dogs, and I have been on board ships where the rations was not what a decent dog would look at.\"  \"But I thought there was regular food, according to a scale,\" Reuben said.  \"Ay, there's that,\" the sailor replied, \"and the government officers see that the quantity's right; but, Lor' bless you! They don't trouble as to quality, and some of the owners buys up condemned stores, and such like; anything, thinks they, is good enough for a convict ship--biscuits as is dropping to pieces, salt junk as 'as been twenty years in cask, and which was mostly horse to begin with. No wonder as they grumbles and growls. A convict is a man, you see, though he be a convict; and it ain't in human nature to eat such muck as that, without growling.\"  \"What tonnage is the vessel?\" Reuben asked.  \"'Leven hundred and fifty ton, and as fine and roomy a ship as there is in the trade, and well officered. I have made three v'yages with the captain and first mate, and the second mate was with us on the last v'yage.\"  \"How many hands are there, altogether?\"  \"Twenty-five, counting you as one, and not a-counting the two stewards.\"  \"We are going to take some passengers, I see,\" Reuben said. \"I have been at work, putting up pegs and shelves for them.\"  \"Yes, there's eight or ten passengers, I hears,\" the sailor said. \"Passengers don't mostly like going by convict ships, but then the fares are lower than by other vessels, and that tempts a few. Besides, the Paramatta is known to be a fast ship, and the skipper has a good name; so we shall have a better class of passengers, I expect, than usually voyages with convict ships; and besides the passengers there will be the officer of the convict guard, and a surgeon, so we shall be pretty full aft.\"  \"And what will my duties be, when we are at sea?\"  \"It just depends on the captain,\" the sailor said. \"You will be put in a watch, and work with the others, except that they may not send you aloft. That depends on the terms that you shipped.\"  \"I shipped as carpenter, and to make myself generally useful, and to obey orders. I shall be happy to do anything I can; hard work is better than doing nothing, any day.\"  \"That's the sort, my lad,\" the sailor said heartily. \"Now I am sail maker, but, bless your heart! Except putting a patch on a sail, now and then, there's nothing to do that way; and when not so wanted I am one of the ordinary crew. Still, if you works your passage, it ain't to be expected as they will drive you the same as a man as is paid. He's a fair man, is the skipper; and you won't find yourself put upon, on board the Paramatta.\"  \"Can't I go up aloft now?\" Reuben asked. \"I would rather accustom myself to it while we are lying steady, than go up when the wind's blowing, and she is heeling over.\"  \"Go up! To be sure you can, and I will go up with you, and tell you some of the names of the ropes, and put you up to things. There's a pleasure in helping a lad who seems in any way teachable. Some of they boys as comes on board a ship ain't worth their salt, in these days.\"  The sailor led the way up the shrouds. Reuben found it much more difficult than it looked. He had seen the sailors running up and down, and it looked as easy as mounting a ladder; but the slackness of the ratlines--which, as the sailor told him, was the name of the pieces of rope which answered to the rounds of a ladder--made it at first awkward. When they reached the main top the sailor told him to sit down, and look round quietly, till he became accustomed to the height.  \"It looks unnatural and risky, at first,\" he said; \"but when you get accustomed to it, you will feel just as safe, when you are astraddle the end of a yard, and the ship rolling fit to take her masts out, as if you were standing on the deck.\"  As Reuben had heard the sailors laughing and joking aloft, as they hauled out the earrings of the sails, he had no doubt that what the sailor said was true; but it seemed, to him, that he should never accustom himself to sit at the end of a spar, with nothing but the water at a vast depth below. It would be bad, even with the ship lying quiet, as at present. It would be terrible with the vessel in a heavy sea.  The sailor now told him the names of the masts and stays, giving him a general idea of the work aloft, and presently asked him whether he would like to return to the deck now, or to mount a bit higher. Although Reuben was now becoming accustomed to the position, he would, had he consulted his inner feelings, have rather gone down than up; but he thought it was better to put a good face on it, and to accustom himself, at once, to what he would probably have to do sooner or later.  Holding on tight then, and following the instructions of his companion, he made his way up until he was seated on the cap of the top-gallant mast, holding tight to the spar, which towered still higher above him. He was surprised at the size and strength of the spars, which had looked so light and slender, from below.  \"Very well done, lad,\" the sailor said approvingly. \"You would make a good sailor, in time, if you took to a seafaring life. There's not one in ten as would get up there, the first time of going aloft. You don't feel giddy, do you?\"  \"No,\" Reuben replied, \"I don't think I feel giddy, but I feel a strange shaky feeling in my legs.\"  \"That will soon pass off,\" the sailor said. \"You look at them hills behind the town, and the forts and works up there. Don't think about the deck of the vessel, or anything, but just as if you were sitting in a chair, watching the hills.\"  Reuben did as the sailor instructed him and, as he did so, the feeling of which he was before conscious passed completely away.  \"I feel all right now,\" he said, after sitting quietly for a few minutes.  \"All right, then; down we go. Don't look below, but just keep your eyes in front of you, and never leave go of one grip till you make sure of the next.\"  Five minutes later he stood on the deck.  \"Well done, my lad, for the first time,\" the first mate said, as Reuben put his foot on the deck \"I have had my eye on you. I shouldn't have let you go beyond the top, at the first trial; but I didn't think you would go higher, till you were fairly up, otherwise I should have hailed you from the deck.  \"You ought not to have taken him up above the top, Bill. If he had lost his head, it would have been all up with him.\"  \"I could see he wasn't going to lose his head. Trust me for not leading a young hand into danger. He was a little flustrated, when he got into the top; but after he had sat down a bit, his breath come quiet and regular again, and I could see there was no chance of his nerve going.\"  The next morning, soon after daybreak, the dockyard boats began to row alongside, with grey-coated convicts. Reuben watched them as they came on board, with a sort of fascination with their closely cut hair, bullet heads, and evil faces. Although he had no doubt that the repulsive expression was due partly to the close-cut hair and shaved faces, and their hideous garb, he could scarcely repress a shudder as he looked at them. In some faces an expression of brutal ferocity was dominant. Others had a shifty, cunning look, no less repulsive.  There were a few good-humoured faces, one or two so different from the others, that Reuben wondered whether they were innocent victims of circumstances, as he had so nearly been. Not till now did he quite realize how great his escape had been. The thought that he might have had to spend the rest of his life herding with such men as these, made him feel almost sick; and he thanked God more fervently, even, than he had done when the verdict was returned which restored him to his liberty, that he had been saved from such a fate.  A hundred and eighty convicts came on board. They were in charge of ten warders, with loaded muskets, and an hour later a party of twenty marines, under the charge of an officer, also embarked. They were on their way out to join a ship in Australian waters, and were to aid the warders in keeping the convicts in good order.  The wind being favourable, no time was lost after the marines had come on board. The moorings were cast off and sails hoisted, and the Paramatta made her way against the tide to the mouth of the Medway; and there dropped her anchor to wait until the tide began to ebb, for the wind was so light that little would have been gained by an attempt to proceed at once. Sail was made again as soon as tide turned and, on turning out next morning at daylight, for he had not yet been assigned to a watch, Reuben found that the ship was lying at anchor in the Downs.  Two or three hours passed.  \"What are we doing here, Bill?\"  \"We are waiting for the passengers. They are all coming on board here. I expect that big lugger you see, running out direct for us, 'as got them on board.\"  \"I wonder they didn't come on board when we started,\" Reuben said. \"I should think it would have been pleasanter than coming all the way down to Dover by coach.\"  \"So I should think, my lad; but you see, it ain't every time as a ship has the luck we've had. It's a long job coming down to the Downs, if the wind don't serve. We might have been beating about there, at the mouth of the Thames, for a week. So you see, most of these 'longshore chaps like to send their traps on board while the vessel's in the docks, and then to come down here and stop till she comes round.\"  In a few minutes the lugger was alongside, the gangway was lowered, and the passengers began to come on board. They were, as the sailor had said they would be, some ten in number. There were six men, four ladies, and three children, the latter not counting as regular passengers, as they were stowed away in their parents' cabins.  The convicts who were on deck looked over the bulwarks, and cracked coarse jokes among themselves, as the passengers ascended the gangway. Reuben found that only one-third of the number were allowed on deck at once. Two soldiers paced up and down the deck, on guard of the hatchway leading below, and two sentries were posted at other points.  A number of small boxes, bags, coats and cloaks were handed up, and then the rope was cast off, and the lugger made her way back to Dover, and the Paramatta again got under sail. While they had been waiting, the chief mate had told Reuben that, according to the captain's orders, he would henceforth be in his watch.  \"As you are not regularly shipped as a sailor,\" the mate said, \"the captain does not wish you to go aloft, unless by your own desire; but there will be plenty of work for you to do on deck, hauling at the braces, scrubbing, and so on.\"  \"I should be glad to do my work with the rest,\" Reuben said, \"as soon as I feel I can be useful aloft. I was up two or three times yesterday, and hope in a few days to be quite accustomed to it.\"  \"I have noticed you, my lad, and you could not be in better hands than Bill's. He is a capital sailor, and as he has taken to you, and you are willing to learn, you will be a useful hand before we get to Sydney; and even if you never go to sea again, all your life, you will find that you have learned a great deal that is useful on board the Paramatta.\"  The fine weather, which the Paramatta had experienced so far, speedily left her. The sky grew overcast, and the wind freshened fast, and the next morning the ship was staggering, under close-reefed canvas, in the teeth of the southwesterly gale.  For the next three days Reuben made no advance in seamanship, being prostrated with seasickness. At times he crept out from the forecastle, and tried to lend a hand whenever he saw a party of men hauling at a rope; but the motion of the ship was so great that he could scarce keep his feet on the slippery decks, and at last the mate ordered him to go back to the forecastle, and remain there until he recovered somewhat from his sickness.  \"I see you are no skulker, my lad; but you will do no good on deck here, and are not unlikely to get a heavy fall, and perhaps a nasty hurt, so you had best lie off till you get over your sickness.\"  Reuben was already drenched to the skin by the spray, and felt so weak that he was not sorry to avail himself of the mate's orders, and to turn in again to his bunk in the forecastle.  On the morning of the fourth day he felt himself again, and turned out. The gale had almost blown itself out, but the sea was very heavy. The fresh air was delightful to Reuben, after the confinement in the forecastle; and as his watch was on deck, he at once went up to Bill and asked him what he could do.  \"Glad to see you about agin, Reuben,\" the sailor said. \"You have had a worse time of it than most. There is a lot of difference atween chaps. Some takes it bad, and some is never ill from the first. Well, there ain't nothing to do at present, but just hold on and get to feel your legs. Don't you try to go across the deck, if the hands are called, until you are accustomed to it; else you will get a fall, to a certainty.\"  \"Is the gale nearly over, Bill?\"  \"Why, it's quite over. Don't you see that for yourself?\"  \"It seems to me to blow hard now.\"  \"Blow hard! Why, there ain't a capful of wind. It was blowing pretty hard yesterday, if you like, but not worth calling a gale. If you are lucky, you are like to know what a gale is, when we get south of the Cape. The wind does blow there, when it has made up its mind. That's the place where they say as the helmsman has to have two men, regular, to hold on his hair.\"  Reuben laughed.  \"I think on the whole, Bill, I would rather get to Sydney without meeting a storm like that. This has been quite enough for me. Why, some of the waves hit the vessel's bow as if they would have knocked it in.\"  \"Wait till you have a gale in earnest, Master Reuben, and you will know about it then. Of course it seemed worse to you, because you were lying there a-doing nothing, and was weak-like with heaving yourself up. If you had been on deck, you would have seen as it was nothing worth talking about.  \"Look at the ship. Everything's in its place, and ship-shape.\"  \"Why, what has become of the tall spars aloft,\" Reuben said, looking up.  \"Oh, they were sent down when the wind freshened,\" Bill said. \"There ain't nothing in that.\"  \"Where are the convicts, Bill?\"  \"Oh, they are all battened down below,\" the sailor said carelessly. \"They only come up for an airing when the weather is fine. They are like the passengers only, instead of pleasing themselves, their ways are marked out for them.\"  \"Have any of the passengers been up?\"  \"Two or three of the men have shown, and a gal. It ain't her first voyage, I'll bet. A pretty thing she is, and as straight as a mast. She's been on deck, off and on, ever since we started.\"  The next morning the sea moderated greatly and, the wind having gone round to the southeast, the Paramatta made the most of it, to get west as far as possible before turning her head to the south.  \"That's a slice of luck,\" Bill Hardy said to Reuben; \"there's nothing like getting well off, at the start. With luck, now, we oughtn't to see the land till we make the Cape.\"  \"But I would rather see the land, Bill. When one is going half round the globe, it is pleasant to touch at ports on the way, and to get a glimpse at foreign peoples and ways.\"  \"Ay, I like a spree on shore,\" Bill agreed; \"but after all, it don't last long; and when you are near land, there's always the chance that the wind may shift round, and you may find yourself dead on a lee shore. The skipper gets anxious and the mates out of temper, and if it does come on to blow hard, from the wrong quarter, there's never no saying what will come of it.  \"No, my lad, there's nothing like a good open sea, with no land within five hundred miles of you, at the least. The coast of Africa ain't a pleasant neighbour. What with the low shores, which you don't see till you are pretty nigh close to them; what with the currents and the changeable winds, and the precious bad lookout there is, if you do get cast ashore, I tell you the wider berth you gives it, the better.\"  The next morning was so fine and bright that all the passengers were on deck, and after breakfast the word was passed forward that the carpenter was wanted. Reuben found that he was wanted to nail some strips of wood on the floor of some of the cabins, to prevent the boxes from shooting out from under the berths when the vessel rolled. As he was at work at one of these, a young lady came to the door of the cabin, and uttered a little exclamation of surprise at seeing Reuben kneeling on the floor. Then, seeing what he was doing, she said:  \"Oh, you are the carpenter, I suppose?\"  \"Yes, miss.\"  \"I wish you would screw on some pegs I brought with me, to hang things upon. Everything does get thrown about so, when the ship's rolling. They are in that trunk, if you will not mind pulling it out.\"  Reuben pulled out the trunk, which the girl opened and, after some search, produced half-a-dozen iron clothes pegs. She showed him where she wished them screwed on, and stood looking on while he carried out her instructions.  \"Are you the ship's carpenter?\"  \"Yes, miss.\"  \"You seem very young for a carpenter, don't you?\"  \"I am young,\" Reuben replied, smiling, \"and this is my first voyage. Fortunately for me, the hand who was engaged hurt himself, just as the vessel was sailing, so I obtained the berth. So far it does not appear that it is a difficult one.\"  The girl looked at him a little curiously. His manner of talk and conversation differed, so much, from the sailors in general.  \"Are you really a carpenter?\" she asked. \"You don't look like a carpenter.\"  \"Yes, I am really a carpenter,\" Reuben answered; \"at least, I am a mill wright by trade. We are a sort of half and half between carpenter and smith.  \"Is there anything else?\" he asked, as he finished screwing the last screw.  \"No, nothing else, thank you,\" the girl answered. \"That will do very nicely, and I am much obliged to you.\"  After finishing his work in the cabins, Reuben went forward.  \"Captain,\" the young lady said, as she went upon deck, \"I have been talking to that young carpenter of yours. I am quite interested in him. Is he really a carpenter? He does not talk a bit like one.\"  \"I believe so, Miss Hudson,\" the captain replied. \"At least, he produced an excellent testimonial from his last employer, when I engaged him. Of course, it might not have been genuine. If there had been time, I should have made more inquiries; but he was well spoken, and had an earnest look about him. But, now you mention it, I don't know that it is very wise letting him go into all the cabins, when I know so little about him.\"  \"Oh, I never thought of that!\" the girl exclaimed. \"I am sure he looks honest. It was only because he spoke so well that I mentioned it.\"  \"He seems to be a sharp young fellow,\" the captain remarked, \"and I see that he has taken to going aloft with the rest of the crew already. He is an emigrant rather than a sailor, for he has only shipped for a passage. I don't know whether he is going to join a man, out there; but if not, he is certainly young to go out on his own account. I do not think he's more than eighteen. He looks so young, he cannot have served all his time at his trade.\"  \"I really feel quite interested in him, Captain Wilson,\" the girl said, turning to a gentleman standing by, who had been listening to the conversation. \"I wish, if you get an opportunity, you would get into conversation with this carpenter of ours, and find out something about him.\"  \"I will, if you like, Miss Hudson; but I don't suppose there's much to find out, and what there is, he's not likely to tell me. From what you say, I should guess that he had had a bad master, and had run away.\"  \"But the captain said he had good testimonials,\" Miss Hudson persisted.  \"As to testimonials,\" the gentleman said, \"anyone can write a testimonial.\"  \"How suspicious you are, Captain Wilson!\" the girl laughed. \"That's the worst of being a police officer, and having to do with criminals. You think whoever you come across is a rogue, until you find out he is an honest man. Now, I think everyone is honest, till I find him out to be a rogue.\"  \"My way is the safest,\" the officer laughed. \"At any rate, on board this ship there are five rogues to each honest man.\"  \"Ah, but that's not a fair average,\" the girl objected. \"Of course, in the colony one has to be careful, considering that half the shepherds and stockmen are convicts, and I must own that the natives are nearly all thieves; but how could it be otherwise, when England sends all its rogues out to us? You see, when free labour gets more abundant, and we can do without convicts, the colonists will protest against it.\"  \"Very likely they will,\" the officer agreed; \"but what is England to do, if she has nowhere to send her rogues?\"  \"That is her business,\" Miss Hudson said carelessly. \"There is no reason why they should be shoved on to us. In the old time, when there were no colonies, England managed somehow, and I suppose she could do so again.\"  \"She managed in a very short way,\" Captain Wilson said. \"She hung them as fast as she caught them. It did not matter much what the offence was, whether stealing a loaf or killing a man; but she could hardly go back to that, now.\"  \"No, she could not,\" Miss Hudson agreed; \"but I have no doubt she can find something useful for them to do, when she has to keep them at home.  \"Don't you think so, captain?\"  \"I daresay she could,\" the captain answered. \"Certainly, if I were a colonist living in a lonely part of the country, I should object to transportation for, what with the natives and bush rangers and bad characters generally, no one can say their life is safe.\"  \"Oh, it's not so bad as that, captain!\" Miss Hudson said indignantly. \"You are giving the place a bad character.\"  \"I think Captain Wilson will agree it's a true one,\" the captain said, smiling.  \"Eh, Captain Wilson?\"  \"I am afraid so,\" the latter replied. \"I know they keep me pretty busy. However, after a year's holiday, I must not grumble if I find plenty to do when I get there.\"  The voyage down to the Cape was wholly uneventful. The Paramatta was most fortunate in her weather and, beyond trimming the sails, the crew had a very easy time of it. Captain Wilson had, as he promised Miss Hudson, taken the opportunity, when Reuben was sitting idly on deck, of having a chat with him; but he did not learn much in the course of the conversation.  \"Your young carpenter puzzles me, Miss Hudson,\" he said to her at dinner. \"He is certainly an altogether exceptionally well-spoken young fellow, for his condition of life; but I can't quite make him out. I think that he has worked as a mill wright. He spoke openly and without hesitation as to his work. But how it is he has thrown it up and emigrated, so young, I can't make out. Of course he cannot have served his time and yet, somehow, I don't think that he has run away, from the manner in which he spoke of his employer.  \"He has no friends whatever in the colony, as far as I could learn. I should say he has certainly been fairly educated, and yet he seems, from his own account, to have worked three or four years at his trade.  \"I certainly like the lad, though I own that, so far, I cannot altogether make him out. Perhaps I shall learn somewhat more about him, before we get to the end of the voyage, and in that case I will tell you all I know.\"  Miss Hudson was the daughter of a wealthy flock owner--or, as he was called, squatter--in New South Wales. Her father and mother were on board the ship with her. This was her fifth voyage. She had gone out as a baby with her parents; and had returned to England, at the age of ten, to be educated. When eighteen, she had joined her mother and father in Australia and, two years later, had come with them to Europe, and had spent some months travelling on the Continent. They were now on their way back to the colony.  The only other single lady among the passengers of the Paramatta was going out, under the charge of the captain, to fill a place as governess in a family in Sydney. Miss Furley was somewhat quiet, but a friendship had naturally sprang up between her and Miss Hudson, as the only two young women on board the ship; and the life and high spirits of the young colonist, and the musical acquirements of Miss Furley, helped to make the voyage pass pleasantly for the passengers in the Paramatta.  Captain Wilson had a good tenor voice, and sang well; and one of the other passengers was able to furnish a bass. Almost every evening, as the ship was running down the tropics before a gentle favouring breeze, the sound of solo and glee singing rose from the little party gathered on the poop; and even the convicts, on deck forward, ceased their talk and listened to the strains.  Although the passage had been a pleasant one, there was a general feeling of satisfaction when the ship dropped her anchor in Table Bay. Most of the passengers went on shore at once, to take up their quarters at the hotel till she sailed again. The captain said that it would take at least a couple of days to fill up the water tanks, and take in a supply of fresh provisions.  On the afternoon of the second day, Reuben asked permission of the first mate to go ashore for a few hours.  \"Certainly, Whitney,\" the officer said. \"You have proved a very useful hand on the way out, which is more than most do who work their passage. Nine out of ten of them are not worth their salt, to say nothing of the rest of their rations. You can stay on shore tonight, if you like; but you must come off early in the morning. We hope to get away in good time.\"  On landing, Reuben was much struck with the variety of the scene. In the streets of Cape Town were men of many types. Here was the English merchant and man of business, looking and dressing just as he would at home. Names over the shop doors were for the most part Dutch, as was the appearance of the majority of the white men in the streets. Dutch farmers in broad hats and homespun garments, mounted on rough ponies, clattered along through the streets. The manual work was for the most part done by swarthy natives, while among the crowd were numbers of Malays, with dark olive skins, small eyes, and jet-black hair, their women being arrayed in every shade of gaudy colour.  For some time Reuben wandered about the streets, greatly amused at all he saw. Towards evening he turned his face towards the sea, as he had no wish to avail himself of the permission given him to sleep on shore. Presently he encountered Miss Hudson and Miss Furley, walking the other way. The former nodded brightly, for she had several times spoken to Reuben, since their first acquaintanceship.  Reuben touched his hat, and proceeded on his way. He had gone but a few yards when he heard a loud cry, and everyone darted suddenly into shops or round corners.  Looking round in surprise, Reuben saw what had caused the movement. A Malay, with his long hair streaming down his shoulders, was rushing down the street, giving vent to terrible yells; in his hand he held a crease, with which, just as Reuben looked round, he cut down a native who had tried, too late, to make his escape.  The two English girls, confused and alarmed at the sudden outburst; and unable, until too late, to comprehend the cause of it, stood alone in the middle of the street and, too terrified now to move, clung to each other, regardless of the shouts to fly raised by people at the windows and doors.  [Illustration: The Ladies Saved from the Malay's Crease.]  The Malay, with a howl of exultation, made at them with uplifted crease. Reuben sprang forward, passed the terrified women when the Malay was within four paces of them, and threw himself with all his force upon him. The Malay, whose eyes were fixed upon the ladies, was taken by surprise by the assault; and his crease had not time to fall when Reuben sprang upon him.  The shock threw both to the ground; Reuben, as he fell, throwing both arms round his adversary. The Malay struggled furiously, and the combatants rolled over and over on the ground. Strong as Reuben was, the frenzy of the Malay gave him greater power; and the lad felt he could not long retain his grip of the arm with which the Malay strove to use his crease.  Help, however, was not long in coming. A native policeman ran up at full speed; and brought his heavy club, with his full force, down on the head of the Malay. The latter's limbs at once relaxed, and Reuben sprang to his feet; breathless, but not seriously harmed, although the blood was freely flowing from some slight wounds he had received from the Malay's sharp-edged weapon.    Chapter 7: Gratitude.   Reuben looked round, upon gaining his feet. He saw Miss Hudson standing by the side of her companion; who had fallen, fainting, to the ground. Mr. Hudson and Captain Wilson, running at their full speed, were within a few paces of the girls. They had entered a shop to make a purchase, while the ladies strolled on; and although they had rushed out on hearing the alarm, they were too far off to render assistance and, impotent to help, had seen with horror the terrible death which threatened the ladies.  Frances Hudson had not uttered a word, from the moment when the Malay rushed down upon them; but as her father came up she turned round, and burst into tears as he clasped her in his arms.  As soon as it was seen that the Malay was no longer dangerous, the people poured out again from the houses and shops. It was no very unusual thing, in Cape Town, for the Malays to run amuck; and many of those in the streets hurried off, in the direction from which the man had come, to inquire how many victims had fallen to his deadly crease, and to see whether any friends were among them. On the Malay himself no one spared a moment's attention. A second tremendous blow, with the policeman's club, had dashed out his brains; for Malays running amuck were always killed upon the spot, partly in order to save further trouble with them, partly to strike terror into others.  Many of the bystanders gathered round Reuben, seized him by the hand, patting him on the shoulder, and praising him for the courage with which he had faced the maddened savage. A minute later, Mr. Hudson forced his way through the crowd. Miss Furley had already been raised, and carried into a shop.  \"Go in with her, my dear,\" Mr. Hudson said to his daughter. \"I will bring him to you directly.  \"My brave fellow!\" he exclaimed, as he made his way to Reuben and grasped his hand, \"how can I thank you for saving my child's life? It seemed to us that she was lost, and that nothing could save her; when we saw you dash past her, and throw yourself unarmed upon the madman. It was a noble deed, indeed.  \"You are not badly hurt, I hope,\" he added, as he saw the blood streaming down Reuben's face and arm.  \"Nothing to speak of, sir,\" Reuben replied. \"At least, I think not; but I feel rather queer from this loss of blood. I had better get myself bandaged up.\"  And indeed, Reuben was turning very pale, partly from the relaxation of the tension of the struggle; partly, as he said, from loss of blood.  \"Stand back!\" Mr. Hudson cried, \"don't press upon him. The lad is nearly fainting. One of you help me get him into a shop. Where is the nearest surgeon to be found?\"  It was as much as Reuben could do to walk across the street, aided by his two supporters. A strong glass of Cape smoke (as the native spirit is called) and water revived him somewhat. It was some minutes before a surgeon arrived; for five persons had been terribly wounded, and two killed by the Malay on his course, and the surgeons near were busily employed.  \"Not very serious,\" the surgeon said, as soon as he examined Reuben's wounds. \"Very different affairs from those I have just come from.\"  \"I had hold of his hand,\" Reuben said, \"so that he couldn't strike. They are only cuts he made in trying to get his arm free.\"  \"That on your arm will not trouble you, though it has bled pretty freely. The one down your face is, fortunately, of no great consequence; except that it has cut down to the bone on the brow and cheek. If it had been an inch further back, it would have severed the temporal artery. You have had a narrow escape of it. As it is, you will get off with a scar, which may last for some time; but as it is an honourable one, perhaps you won't so much care. However, I will bring it together as well as I can, and stitch it up, and it may not show much.\"  The wound was sewn up and then bandaged, as was that on the arm. The other and slighter wounds were simply drawn together by slips of plaster. When all was done, Reuben said to Mr. Hudson:  \"I shall do very well now, sir. I am sure you must wish to go to Miss Hudson. I will sit here a bit longer, and then go on board the ship.\"  \"You will do nothing of the kind,\" Mr. Hudson said. \"I have just sent for a vehicle, and you will come to the hotel and get into bed at once. You are not fit to stand now, but I hope a good night's rest will do you good.\"  Reuben would have protested, but at this moment a vehicle arrived at the door, and with it Captain Wilson entered.  \"I have just taken your daughter and Miss Furley to the hotel, Hudson,\" he said. \"They are both greatly shaken, and no wonder. So I thought it better to see them back, before coming in to shake hands with our gallant young friend here.\"  \"He has lost a good deal of blood, Wilson; and I am just taking him off, to get him to bed in the hotel.  \"So we won't do any thanking till the morning,\" Mr. Hudson said, seeing that Reuben's lip quivered, and he was incapable of bearing any further excitement. \"Do you take one of his arms and I will take the other, and get him into that trap.\"  A quarter of an hour later, Reuben was in bed at the hotel. Mr. Hudson brought him up a basin of clear soup. Having drunk this, he turned over and was, in a very few minutes, asleep. The captain and most of the other passengers were at the same hotel, and there was great excitement when the news arrived of the terrible danger the two girls had run. Mrs. Hudson had, from her early life, been accustomed to emergencies; and the instant the girls arrived she took them up to the room they shared between them, and insisted upon their going at once to bed, after partaking of a cup of tea.  \"What am I to do for this young fellow, Wilson?\" Mr. Hudson asked as, having seen his patient comfortably in bed, he returned downstairs, and took a seat in the verandah by his fellow passenger. \"I owe Frances' life to him, and there is nothing I wouldn't do for him. The question is, what? One does not like to offer money to a man, for such a service as this.\"  \"No,\" Mr. Wilson agreed, \"especially in his case. The young fellow appears to me very much above his condition. Your daughter first pointed it out to me, and I have since chatted with him several times, and find him a very superior young fellow. Certainly his education has been very different from that of most men in his condition of life, and I should have taken him for a gentleman, who had got into some scrape and run away, had it not been that he seems to have been regularly apprenticed to his trade. Still, there is something a little mysterious about him. I asked him casually what part of the country he came from. He hesitated a moment, and then said, 'From the south of England.' Of course, I did not ask any further questions, as it was clear he did not care about naming the precise locality, or he would not have given so vague an answer. I feel as deeply indebted to him as you do.\"  Mr. Hudson nodded. Only the evening before arriving at Cape Town, Captain Wilson had spoken to him on the matter of his affection for his daughter, and had asked his permission to speak to Frances. They had known each other in the colony, but had not been intimate until thrown together on board the Paramatta. Seeing that she was an only child, and that her father was considered one of the wealthiest squatters in the colony, Captain Wilson had feared that Mr. Hudson would not approve of him as a suitor; and had therefore broached the subject to him, before speaking to her. Mr. Hudson, however, had raised no objections.  \"You have taken a manly and proper course, in speaking to me first,\" he said; \"just what I should have expected from you. I own that, with the fortune the girl will have some day, I have always looked for her making what they call a good match, and settling down in the old country; but I may tell you that while she has been in Europe she has had several opportunities of so doing, if she would have taken them. She did not think fit to do so, and I have always made up my mind not to influence her in any way, providing she didn't fix her choice upon one whose character I disapproved. Certainly I have no reasons for so doing, in the present case. Your character stands high in the colony; and personally, as you are well aware, I like you exceedingly.  \"What Frances' feelings in the matter are, I have no means of knowing. There is no doubt she likes you, but as to anything more, it is for you to find out. You will have plenty of time, between this and Sydney. Anyhow, you have my hearty approval of your wooing.  \"I think, between ourselves you know, you must not expect, at first, any very cordial approval on the part of her mother. She had an idea, you know, that Frances would marry a duke at least, and an offer from a prince of the blood would not have surprised her. It is a great disappointment, to her, that she should have returned unmarried; and she has already been talking to me about our returning to England, in another couple of years. So she will not take quite kindly to it, at first; but you mustn't mind that. Fond of Frances as she is, she will soon come round, if she finds that the girl's happiness is really concerned in the matter.  \"Take my advice, and don't push it till we get near the end of the voyage. If Frances says yes, she is the sort of girl to stick to it; and as I am with you, you may be quite sure it will come right in the long run; but we might not have a very pleasant time of it during the remainder of the voyage, you know, and as things have gone on so pleasantly, it would be a pity to spoil them.\"  Thus it was that Mr. Hudson nodded, when the young officer of the constabulary said that his indebtedness to Reuben was equal to his own.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"if it had been one of the sailors, I could have set the matter right by drawing a big cheque, and I shouldn't have cared how big; but with this young fellow I do not quite see my way. However, I will shift the responsibility, by leaving the matter in Frances' hands--women are much better hands at things of this sort, that require a light touch, than we are. I do not wonder that she and Miss Furley are shaken. I feel shaken myself. I shall never forget that scene, and the two girls standing there, and that wild Malay rushing at them. My legs seemed to give way under me, and I thought I should have fallen down.\"  \"I felt bad myself, sir,\" Captain Wilson said. \"I have been in some tough fights, with bush rangers and natives; but I never had that sort of feeling before.  \"One ran, but one felt it was no use running, as all must be over before we could get there. When it was over, I felt as weak as a child.\"  \"Don't let us talk any more about it,\" Mr. Hudson said, rising. \"I doubt whether I shall get a wink of sleep now; and I am sure I sha'n't, if we go on talking any more about it. Let us take a turn, and have a stiff glass of brandy and water afterwards, to settle our nerves before turning in.\"  The passengers by the Paramatta were up early in the morning, for the ship was to sail at nine. But early as they were, Reuben was before them; and on Mr. Hudson inquiring about him, as he turned out, he was informed that he had already gone on board the ship.  The two girls both looked pale, when they came down to their early breakfast. Both declared, however, that they had slept well.  \"You must give us time, dad, to get up our roses,\" Frances Hudson said, in reply to her father's remarks as to their appearance. \"I have no doubt a few days at sea will do it; but of course, it is only right and proper that young ladies should be pale, after going through such an adventure as we had yesterday.  \"But do not let us talk about it,\" she said, with a shudder. \"I should like not to be able to think about it, again, for six months. You used to say, dad, that I was plucky, because I wasn't afraid of wild cattle, and not very afraid of the natives or bush rangers; but I am sure I cannot lay claim to any special courage in future, for no one in the world could feel more frightened than I did, yesterday.\"  \"Well, my dear, you were no worse than anyone else, for everyone else bolted at the first alarm. The way that street was cleared was something marvellous.\"  \"Yes, dad; but I was too frightened to run. Not that it would have been any use if I had, for he was close to us before we knew what was the matter; and if I could have run, I don't think Emma could.\"  \"No, indeed,\" Miss Furley said. \"I had no idea of running and, even had there been plenty of time, I am sure I could not have got out of the way. Somehow I seemed to lose all power to move. I had just shut my eyes, and thought it was all over, when there was a shout and a rush, and I saw the Malay roll over; and then I made a snatch at Frances, and rolled over, too.\"  \"It was a terrible moment,\" Mr. Hudson said. \"But I agree, with Frances, that it is better for you to try and think nothing more about it, until you have perfectly recovered your health and spirits.\"  \"I hear, dad, that the young man that saved us has gone on board ship. I asked, directly I was up, because I wanted to see him.\"  \"And I expect, my dear, that he slipped away because he didn't want to see you. It sounds rude, doesn't it? But I can perfectly understand it.\"  \"So can I,\" the girl agreed. \"Did you see him this morning?\"  \"No, my dear. I came downstairs only a minute or two before you did, and then found that he was gone.\"  \"Have you thought over what you are going to do, dad, for him?\"  \"Wilson and I have talked it over, Frances, but at present we don't see our way. It is too serious a matter to make up our minds in a hurry. Your mother is in favour of giving him a handsome present; but I don't think, myself, that that would do. Men who will do such deeds as that are not the sort of men to be paid by money.\"  \"Oh no, dad! Surely not that. Any other possible way, but not money.\"  \"No, my dear; so I thought. I have chatted it over with Wilson, and we have agreed that the best plan is to leave it entirely in your hands.\"  \"I will think it over, dad,\" the girl said gravely. \"It is a serious thing. We owe him our lives, and the least we can do is not to hurt his feelings, by the way in which we try to show our gratitude.\"  Reuben had slept well; and on waking, soon after daylight, jumped at once out of bed; and was glad to feel that, except for a certain amount of weakness in the legs, and stiffness in his wounds, he was all right again. He dressed quietly and, as soon as he heard persons moving about in the hotel, made his way down to the shore, and sat down there to wait for a boat from the ship; which was lying some distance out, and would, he was sure, be sending off early, as there would be many things to bring on board before she sailed.  It was not long before he saw the men descending the gangway to the boat alongside, which was soon rowing towards the shore. As she approached, Reuben saw the steward and first mate, sitting in the stern seats; and when the officer jumped ashore, his eye fell on Reuben.  \"Ah, Whitney,\" he said, \"I am glad to see you about. When the captain came off, last night, he told me all about your gallant rescue of the two ladies. I am sorry to see you bandaged up so much. The captain said you had some nasty cuts, but I didn't think they were so bad.\"  \"They are nothing to speak about, sir,\" Reuben replied, \"although you would think so, from seeing those bandages all over one side of the face, and my arm in a sling; but they are no great depth, and don't hurt to speak of. They were clean cuts with a sharp edge, and don't hurt half as much as many a knock I have had, with a hammer.\"  \"Well, we all feel proud of you, my lad. It isn't everyone who would face a Malay running amuck, without weapons, I can tell you.\"  \"I think any English sailor would do so, sir, if he saw the Malay rushing down upon two ladies. There was no time to think about danger, one way or the other. The only thing to be done was to rush at him, and so I rushed, as anyone else would have done.\"  \"Ah, it's all very well to say so, Whitney; but I have my doubts about everyone else rushing. However, I mustn't stand talking about it now, as I have my hands full of work. The sooner you get on board the ship, the better.  \"Row Whitney back to the ship, lads, and come back again in an hour's time. None of the things will be down here before that.\"  Reuben stepped into the boat, which at once pushed off. The men rowed easily, for they were anxious to hear the particulars of the report which had circulated through the ship. Bill Hardy was rowing the stroke oar, and did the questioning.  \"You may try to make little of it,\" he said, \"but I tell you, Reuben, it were a right down good thing--a thing any man would have right to be proud of.  \"What do you say, mates?\"  There was a general chorus of \"Ay, ay.\"  \"I took you in hand when you came on board, young un,\" Bill went on, \"and I looks upon you as my chick, and I tell you I feel proud on you. I felt sure you would turn out a good un, some day, but I didn't look to see it so quick.  \"In oars!\"  The boat ran up alongside the gangway, and Reuben was soon upon deck. He was there met by the captain, who had just come up as the boat rowed alongside. He shook Reuben's hand heartily.  \"You are a fine young fellow, Whitney; and your mother, if you have one, ought to be proud of you. I should be, if you were a son of mine. It was a lucky day for us all, when I shipped you on board the Paramatta; for it would have been a heavy day for us, if those two young ladies had been killed by that madman, yesterday.  \"You look pale, lad, as much as one can see of you, and you will have to lie by for a bit. I hear you lost a great deal of blood.  \"Steward, bring another cup of cocoa with mine, a large one, and put plenty of milk in.\"  The captain insisted on Reuben coming to his cabin to drink his cocoa.  \"You had best knock off your allowance of spirits, till your wounds have healed up, lad. I will tell the second mate to serve you out port wine, instead.\"  Reuben now went forward, feeling very much the better for the cocoa. He again had to receive the hearty congratulations of the men; and then, rather to escape from this than because he felt he needed it, he turned into his bunk, and was soon sound asleep.  Three hours later, he was awakened by the tramp of men overhead, and knew that they were shortening the anchor chain, and preparing to be off. Going out on to the deck, he saw that the courses had been dropped, and the topsails were lying loose in their gaskets. The crew were singing merrily, as they worked the capstan. Three of the boats already hung from the davits, and two large boats were bringing off the passengers, and were already within a hundred yards of the ship; while the remaining ship's boat, with the steward, crowded with fresh stores, was but a short way behind them. As soon as the passengers were up, and the shore boats had left, she came alongside.  \"Hook on the falls at once,\" the first mate ordered, \"and run her up as she is. You can get the things out afterwards.\"  The anchor was, by this time, under the foot.  \"Up with it, lads!\" and the sailors again started, at full speed, on the capstan.  The jibs were run up, the courses and topsails shaken out and braced, and the Paramatta began to steal through the water again, for the second portion of her voyage. Mr. Hudson and his friend very soon made their way forward, and the ship was scarcely under way when Reuben, who was gazing over the bulwark at the shore, felt a hand laid on his shoulder.  \"How are you today, Reuben? Better, I hope? It was too bad of you to run off in that way, this morning.\"  \"I am all right now, thank you, sir,\" Reuben answered. \"I felt just a little shaky at first, but the captain gave me a cup of cocoa when I came on board, and I feel now as if I were fit for duty again.\"  \"Oh, nonsense,\" Mr. Hudson exclaimed, \"you mustn't think of work, for days yet. No, you must come aft with me. My daughter and Miss Furley are most anxious to see you; and my wife, too, is longing to add her thanks to mine.\"  \"You are very good, sir, but really I would rather not, if you will excuse me. It is horrid being thanked and made a fuss about, just because, on the spur of the moment, one did one's duty.\"  \"That's all very well, Reuben; but you see, it wouldn't be fair to my daughter. If anyone did you a great service, you would want to thank them, would you not?\"  \"Yes, I suppose so, sir,\" Reuben answered reluctantly; \"but really, I hate it.\"  \"I can understand your feelings, my lad, but you must make up your mind to do it. When anyone puts others under a vast obligation to him, he must submit to be thanked, however much he may shrink from it. Come along, it will not be very dreadful.\"  Reuben saw that there was no getting out of it, and followed Mr. Hudson along the deck; feeling, however, more ashamed and uncomfortable even than he did when standing in the dock, as a criminal. Captain Wilson walked beside him. Hitherto he had not spoken, but he now laid his hand quietly upon Reuben's shoulder.  \"My lad,\" he said, \"I am not a man to talk much; but believe me that, henceforth, I am your friend for life.\"  Reuben looked up, with a little smile which showed that he understood. He had often, indeed, watched the young officer and Miss Hudson together, and had guessed that they were more than mere acquaintances.  The passengers were, with the exception of the three ladies, all gathered on the poop. But Frances had proposed to her mother that they should see Reuben in the cabin alone, as she felt that it would be a severe ordeal, to the lad, to be publicly thanked. Captain Wilson ascended to the poop and joined the others there, while Mr. Hudson went alone into the cabin.  The three ladies were awaiting him there. Frances came forward first. The tears were standing in her eyes.  \"You have saved my life,\" she said softly, \"at the risk of your own; and I thank you with all my heart, not only for my own sake, but for that of my father and mother; who would have been childless, today, had it not been for you.\"  \"I need no thanks, Miss Hudson,\" Reuben said quietly.  His shyness had left him, as he entered the cabin.  \"It will, all my life, be a source of pleasure and gratification to me, that I have been able to have been of service to so bright and kind a lady.\"  \"I am not less grateful,\" Miss Furley said, advancing also. \"I shall never forget that dreadful moment, and the feeling which darted through my mind, as you rushed past us and threw yourself upon him, and I felt that I was saved almost by a miracle.\"  \"And you must accept my thanks also,\" Mrs. Hudson said; \"the thanks of a mother, whose child you have saved from so dreadful a death. Believe me that there is nothing that my husband or myself would not do, to show how deeply and sincerely we are grateful to you.\"  Mrs. Hudson, indeed, felt rather aggrieved that she could not, at once, take some active steps towards rewarding the young man for saving her daughter's life; and she had been unable to understand the scruples of her husband and daughter on the subject. It was only, indeed, at their urgent entreaty that she had given way on this point.  \"I call it monstrous, Frances,\" she said, almost angrily. \"Of course the young man will expect something more substantial than words. It is only natural that we should reward him for preserving your life, and it would be a crime if we didn't do so. Of course, he didn't do it for money at the time, but it is absurd to suppose that a young carpenter like this, working his way out on board a ship, will object to receive a handsome present for such a service as this. Our feelings have a right to be considered, as well as his; and a nice thing it will be, for people to say that Ralph Hudson and his wife were so stingy, and ungrateful, that they did nothing for the lad who had saved their daughter's life.\"  \"There is no fear of their saying that, mother. Everyone in the colony knows that there are no more open-handed people in New South Wales than you and my father. Besides, I do not say that we are to do nothing for him. On the contrary, I agree with you that it would be wrong, indeed, if we did not. I only say, please don't let there be a word said about reward, now. Let us thank him as one would thank a gentleman, who had done us a great service.\"  \"Of course, I will do as your father wishes, Frances, but I call it nonsense. If he were a gentleman it would, of course, be different; but he is a young carpenter and, though you won't see it, that seems to me to make all the difference.\"  \"From what I have seen of him, mother,\" Frances persisted, \"I am sure that he has the feelings of a gentleman; even if he is not one by birth, about which I am not certain. Anyhow, I am much obliged to you for letting me have my own way.\"  \"You always do have your own way, Frances,\" her mother laughed. \"You get round your father first, and then you come to me, and what can I do against the two of you?\"  Reuben briefly answered Miss Furley and Mrs. Hudson; and Mr. Hudson, feeling that the lad would rather get over the scene as soon as possible, slipped his arm though his and said:  \"Now, Reuben, you must just come up for a minute on the poop. The other passengers are all waiting to shake you by the hand, and they would not forgive me if I were to let you run off, as I know you are wanting to do, without a word.\"  Accordingly Reuben was taken up to the poop, where the passengers all shook hands with him, and congratulated him upon his courage.  \"Now, I suppose I can go, sir,\" he said, with a smile to Mr. Hudson, when this was over.  \"Yes, you can go now,\" Mr. Hudson laughed. \"Most young fellows at your age would be glad of an opportunity for figuring as a hero, but you talk as if it was one of the most painful businesses imaginable.\"  \"Anyhow, I am glad it's over, Mr. Hudson, I can assure you; and now, I think I will turn in again. Considering what a night I had, I feel wonderfully sleepy.\"  It was not until the sun was setting that Reuben appeared again on deck. Shortly after he did so, Captain Wilson strolled up to the place where he was standing.  \"I wish, Reuben,\" he said, after a few remarks on other subjects, \"that you would tell me a little more about yourself. You understand that I do not ask from mere inquisitiveness; but after what has happened, you see, we seem to have got into close relationship with each other; and if I knew more about you, I could the easier see in what way I could most really be useful to you, out there. Are you what you appear to be?\"  \"I am, indeed,\" Reuben replied, with a smile. \"My history is a very simple one. My father was a miller with a good business and, up to the age of ten, it did not appear that I should ever be working as a craftsman for my living. Unhappily, at that time my father slipped, one night, into the mill pond and was drowned; and when his affairs came to be wound up, it was found that he had speculated disastrously in wheat; and that, after paying all claims, there was nothing left.  \"My mother took a little village shop, and I went to the village school. At first, I think I did not work very hard; but fortunately there was a change in masters, and the new one turned out one of the best friends a boy ever had. He pushed me on greatly and, when I was apprenticed to a mill wright, he urged me to continue my education by working of an evening. I stuck to it hard, and with his help learned, therefore, a good deal more than was usual, in my station of life. My mother was always particular about my speaking and, what with that and the books, I suppose I talk better than they generally do.\"  \"And is your mother alive?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"But how came you to think of emigrating, at your age; when indeed, you cannot have served out your full time?\"  \"That, sir,\" Reuben said gravely, \"I cannot tell you. Some day, perhaps, if you care to know, I may bring myself to do so. I may say that it was a serious matter, but that I was really in no way to blame, whatever people may think. My conscience is absolutely clear, and yet I would rather that the story, which I left England to escape, should not be known to anyone.\"  \"I do not seek to know further, Reuben. I think I know enough of you to be perfectly sure that you would do nothing that was wrong, and I am perfectly willing to take your word in the matter. However, I am glad that you have told me as much as you have. Your early rearing, your mother's care, and the education you have had, perfectly account for what seemed strange about you before. You have no objection, I hope, to my repeating your story to Mr. Hudson, who is as much interested in you as I am.  \"And now another thing. I know that it is painful, to him, that one to whom he is so indebted should be forward here in the forecastle, instead of being in the cabin. He was afraid of hurting your feelings, by speaking to you about it; but I know that it would be a great relief and pleasure, to him and Mrs. Hudson, if you would allow them to make an arrangement with the captain that, for the remainder of the voyage, you should be a passenger.\"  \"I am much obliged to them,\" Reuben said quietly; \"but I could not think of accepting such an offer. I am working my way out independently, sir, and I owe no one anything. I am really enjoying the passage, and so far there has been no hardship worth speaking of. Even putting aside the fact that I should not like to accept an obligation which would, to most people, look like a payment for the service I was fortunate enough to be able to render to Mr. Hudson, I should feel out of my element. I am very comfortable, and get on very well with the men; while in the cabin I should feel strange, and out of place.\"  \"I don't think you would seem out of place anywhere, Reuben. No one, from your manner and conversation, would judge you to be otherwise than a gentleman by birth; while there are several of the passengers, aft, whose talk and methods of expression are by no means up to the level of yours.\"  \"I should feel uncomfortable myself,\" Reuben said, \"even if I didn't make other people uncomfortable. So I think that, with all gratitude for the offer, I would very much rather remain as I am. Accustomed as I have been to hard work, during my apprenticeship, the life here appears to be exceedingly easy.\"  \"Then we will say no more about it,\" Captain Wilson said. \"It would have been a pleasure, both to me and the Hudsons, to have you aft, and I am sure you would be well received by all the passengers. However, as you think you would not be comfortable, we will let the matter drop.  \"However, as to your work in the colony, we must have a say in that; and I hope that, when I thoroughly understand your wishes, we shall be able to help you forward there.\"  \"For that I shall be extremely obliged, sir. It would be a great thing, indeed, for anyone on landing to have gentlemen ready to assist him, and push him forward. This is so at home, and is of course still more the case in a strange country. I am very anxious to get on, and am ready to work my hardest, to deserve any kindness that may be shown me.\"  \"Well, we shall have plenty of time to think it over before we arrive.  \"I fancy,\" Captain Wilson went on, looking upwards at the sky, \"that our wonderful run of good luck, with regard to the weather, is likely to end shortly, and that we are in for a gale.\"  \"Do you think so, sir?\"  \"I do, indeed; and if we do get a gale, it is likely to be a serious one. The Cape, you know, was much feared for its terrible storms by the Portuguese, and it has kept up its reputation ever since. I think it is going to give us a taste of its quality.\"    Chapter 8: A Gale.   \"Wilson tells me he thinks we are going to have a gale, Bill.\"  \"Ay, ay, Reuben; anyone with half an eye could see that.\"  \"Which way is it likely to come?\"  \"Most likely from the north or northwest. At least that's the quarter it's likely to settle into; but there ain't no saying which way it may take us. I thought things had been going on too smooth to last. Now you are going to see what a storm is, my lad. You thought it was blowing when we went down the Channel.\"  \"Is it likely to be much heavier than that, Bill?\"  \"Heavier!\" the sailor repeated scornfully. \"Why, there's as much difference between a capful of wind in the Channel, and a gale off the Cape, as there is between a newborn baby and me.\"  \"Do they last long, generally?\"  \"Last! Why they goes on for weeks. There ain't no end to them. I've wondered sometimes to myself where all the wind comes from, and where it goes to, onlass it works round and round.\"  \"But it does work round and round, Bill?\"  \"Ay, when you are near the centre of it. Why, lad, in three hours I have gone round the compass three times, with the wind dead aft all the time; but that's only when you are near the centre. When you ain't it blows straight, and I have known vessels run for days--ay, for weeks--with the wind blowing all the time in the same quarter. Some have been blown down right to the edge of the ice, south. I have been among the icebergs myself, two or three times, and I guess that many a ship has laid her bones down in the ice fields there, and no news ever come back home as to what's come to them; and what makes it worse is as we have convicts on board.\"  \"What difference does that make, Bill?\"  \"It don't make no difference, as long as all goes straight and fair. I have heard, in course, of risings; but that's only when either the guard are very careless, or the men is so bad treated that they gets desperate, and is ready to die on the off chance of getting free. So far we ain't had no trouble with them. The ship is kept liberal, and the poor wretches ain't cheated out of the rations as government allows them. The officer in charge seems a good sort, and there's no knocking of them about, needless; so there ain't no fear of trouble, as long as things go square. But when things goes wrong, and a vessel gets cast away or anything of that kind, then there's well-nigh sure to be trouble. The convicts seize their opportunity, and it ain't scarce in human nature for them not to take it, and then there ain't no saying what will happen.\"  \"Why, what a croaker you are, Bill! I didn't expect that from you.\"  \"I ain't no croaker, Reuben, but I knows what I knows. I have been through a job like that I am telling you of, once; and I don't want to do it again. I will tell you about it, some day. I ain't saying as I expect any such thing will happen, on board the Paramatta. God forbid. She's a tight ship, and she's got as good officers and crew as ever I sailed with. She has as good a chance as ever a ship had; but when I sees that 'ere sort of sky in these latitudes, I feels as we are in for a tough job.\"  The conversation was broken off, abruptly, by the call of the first mate.  \"All hands aloft to shorten sail!\"  \"The bells is ringing up for the beginning of the performance, Reuben. Here goes aloft!\"  The next minute the whole of the crew were climbing the shrouds, for the watch off duty were all on deck, and the order was expected; for the signs of the weather could, by this time, be read by every sailor on board. Above, the sky was still bright and blue; but around the whole circle of the horizon, a mist seemed to hang like a curtain.  \"Smartly, lads, smartly,\" the captain shouted; \"don't hurry over your work, but do it with a will.  \"I hope we have not left it too long, Mr. James. I have held on longer than I ought, for every mile we get away from land is an advantage, and we have been running nearly due south, ever since I noticed the first falling of the glass when we got up in the morning.\"  \"I think we shall have time, sir,\" the mate said. \"We are going to have it, and no mistake, presently; but it don't seem to be coming up fast.\"  \"The glass is going down rapidly,\" the captain said. \"It's down an inch already, and is still falling.  \"Mr. Mason,\" he went on, to the officer in command of the detachment of marines, \"will you kindly place your men under the orders of Mr. James? I am going to send down all the upper spars, and they can be useful on deck.\"  Never was the Paramatta stripped more rapidly of her sails, for every man was conscious of the urgency of the work. As soon as the sails were furled, the yards were sent down. The upper spars followed them and, in little over half an hour from the time the men began to ascend the shrouds, the Paramatta was metamorphosed. Her tall tapering masts and lofty spread of sail were gone. Every spar above the topmasts had been sent down to the deck; and she lay under close-reefed topsails, a stay sail, and a storm jib. The captain gave a sigh of relief, as the men began to descend the rigging.  \"Thank God, that is safely accomplished. Now we are in readiness for whatever may come.\"  He dived into his cabin, and returned almost immediately.  \"The glass has fallen another half inch, Mr. James,\" he said gravely. \"I have never but once seen it as low.  \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he went on, addressing the passengers, who were gathered in a group, talking in low tones and anxiously watching the wall of vapour; which now seemed to rise from the water's edge and reach far up into the sky, the circle of view extending scarce half a mile in any direction; \"I must ask you to go below, at once. The storm may strike us any moment now, and when it does come it will come heavily. I should like the deck perfectly clear, and nothing to disturb my thoughts from the working of the ship.\"  Reuben had not gone aloft, as he was called back, just as he began to ascend the shrouds, by the first mate, and ordered to go round the cabins and fasten the dead lights securely. When this was done, he aided the marines in nailing tarpaulins over the cabin skylights, and then went round the deck, seeing that every movable article was securely lashed. When this was done he joined Bill who, with some others, had been at work securing all the hatches. The convicts had long since been all sent below.  \"Shall I send my men down, captain?\" Mr. Mason asked.  \"There is no occasion for it, just at present; but you had better pass the word for all of them to hold on, when the gale strikes her. That will be the critical moment. Once past that, she will be all right till the sea begins to rise. Then you had best get them below, for we shall have the water sweeping knee deep along the waist, in no time.  \"I should say send them down at once; but I know many of them have been to sea before, and may be useful in cutting away, if anything goes.\"  \"She looks snug enough, captain,\" the young officer said, glancing up at the diminished spread of canvas.  \"She is snug enough for any ordinary gale,\" the captain said; \"but this is not going to be an ordinary gale. When we once get her before it, it will be all right.  \"Do you think we have another five minutes, Mr. James?\"  \"There's no saying, sir; but I should think so. What do you want, sir?\"  \"I want that top sail off her, altogether.\"  \"I will do it, sir,\" the mate said and, calling Bill Hardy and two others of the best sailors, he led the way up the main shrouds.  Every eye on deck was fixed on the four seamen as, rapidly but steadily, they proceeded to furl and stow the sail. There was still not a breath of wind, but a low humming noise was heard.  \"Quick, Mr. James, never mind the sail. All hands on deck!\" the captain shouted; but the work was just done, and the sailors ran quickly down the ratlines on to the deck.  \"Thank God!\" the captain said reverently, \"that is done.\"  The ship was now under the close-reefed fore-top sail, a diminutive try sail on the mizzen, and the jib. The hum had increased to a roar, but still not a breath of wind stirred the sails.  \"Look up!\" Bill said to Reuben; \"you may be at sea fifty years, and never see that again.\"  Reuben looked up. Immediately overhead was a small circle of blue sky, round and round whose edge the edging of cloud seemed to be circling, with extreme velocity. The light seemed to pierce straight down onto the vessel, and she stood, pale and white, while all around her a pitchy blackness seemed to prevail.  \"We are in the eye of the storm, my lad. Here it comes. Now, hold on for your life.\"  In another moment it seemed to Reuben that the end of all things was come. He was pinned against the bulwark, as if by a mighty invisible hand; and the vessel heeled over and over, until the deck seemed to rise in a wall above him. Then the water poured over him and, though he still held on, he thought the vessel had capsized. Then he felt her rising beneath his feet, and his head emerged from the water.  The captain, the first mate, and two seamen were at the wheel. Reuben saw the captain wave his hand, but his words were lost in the fury of the wind. The second mate, Bill Hardy, and two or three other sailors knew what was required, and hauled upon the lee brace of the fore-top-sail yard. The Paramatta was still lying nearly over on her beam ends, but gradually her head began to pay off, and she slowly righted. A minute later she was tearing directly before the gale. Scarcely had she done so, when the fore-top sail blew out of the bolt ropes, with a report that was heard even above the howl of the tempest.  \"It's done its work,\" Bill shouted in Reuben's ear. \"I thought she was gone. Just a little more, and she would have turned turtle.\"  The captain had used almost precisely the same words to the first officer, adding:  \"She will do now, but we shall have to try to get a little more head sail on her, when the sea gets up. Call some of the hands aft, and get this try sail down. She yaws so, now the fore-top sail's gone, there is no steering her.\"  This was soon done and, under bare poles, the storm jib now the only sail upon her, the Paramatta tore through the water. There was little motion, for the sea had not begun to get up, seeming to be pressed flat by the force of the wind. The captain now left the helm. Two or three of the male passengers were standing at the top of the companion, peering out.  \"You can come out, gentlemen, for a bit. She is running on an even keel now, though that won't last long. No one hurt below, I hope.\"  \"Two or three of us have got bruised a little, captain; and I think we have all of us got a severe fright. We thought she was over.\"  \"I thought so, too,\" the captain said. \"Luckily she has got three hundred tons of iron on board, and it's all stowed at the bottom of the cargo, so that helped her up again; but it was touch and go with her, for half a minute.  \"And now, gentlemen, if you will take my advice you will just look round, and then go below and turn in. Now you can do so easily. Another hour, and there will be no keeping a footing.\"  The captain was right. In less than the time he named, a terrific sea had got up. The Paramatta had already made more than one circuit of the compass. There was no regularity in the sea. It seemed to rise suddenly in heaps, now striking the ship on one side, now on another, and pouring sheets of water over her bulwarks. The motion of the vessel was so tremendous that even Bill Hardy and the older seamen could only move along with the greatest difficulty to carry out the orders of the captain; while Reuben clung to the shrouds, now half buried in water, now almost hanging in the air, with the sea racing along under his feet.  As yet no more sail had been put upon her, for there was no following sea. Although running almost before the gale, a slight helm was kept upon her, so as to edge her out from the centre of the storm; and the second circle of the compass took more than twice as long as the first to complete, although the vessel was proceeding with equal speed through the water.  Hour after hour the sea got up--a wild, cross, broken sea--and the motion of the vessel was so terrific as to be almost bewildering to the oldest hands. There was none of the regular rise and fall of an ordinary sea; the vessel was thrown with violent jerks, now on one side, now on the other; now plunging her bow so deeply down that she seemed about to dive, head foremost, beneath the waves; now thrown bodily upwards, as if tossed up by some giant hand beneath her. The watch off duty was sent below, for there was nothing that could be done on deck; and the water swept over her in such masses as to threaten, at times, to carry everything before it. One man had had his leg broken. Several had been seriously bruised and hurt.  \"This is terrible, Bill,\" Reuben said, as he went below.  \"Ay, lad; I have been at sea, man and boy, over forty years, and it's the worst sea I ever saw. I expect to see her masts go out of her, before long. Nothing could stand such straining as this. You had best turn in at once. Unless I am mistaken, it will be all hands to the pumps, before long. If she hadn't been one of the tightest crafts afloat, she would have been making water at every seam, by this time.\"  Reuben felt, the instant he lay down, that sleep was out of the question; for it needed all his strength to prevent himself from being thrown out of his bunk. The noise, too, was terrific--the rush and swell of the water overhead, the blows which made the ship shiver from stem to stern, the creaking of the masts, and howling of the wind. Night had set in, now. It was pitch dark in the forecastle, for the swinging lantern had been dashed so violently against the beams that the light was extinguished.  Half an hour after Reuben turned in, a crash was heard. A moment later the door was opened, and there was a shout:  \"The mizzen has gone! All hands to cut away the wreck!\"  The watch turned out and began to make their way aft, and were soon engaged with knife and hatchet in cutting away the wreck of the mizzen which, towing behind, threatened, with each heavy following sea, to plunge into the vessel's stern. A cheer broke from the men as the last rope was cut, and the wreck floated astern. The mast had gone close to the deck, smashing the bulwark as it fell over the side. The motion of the ship was easier, for its loss.  \"Mr. James,\" the captain shouted, \"we must get preventer stays, at once, upon the fore mast. The main mast may go, if it likes, and at present we shall be all the better without it, but the foremast we must keep, if we can.\"  \"Ay, ay, sir. I will set about it, at once.\"  Picking out a few of the best hands, the first mate proceeded about the work.  \"Go and sound the well, Reuben,\" the captain said.  Reuben went off at once, and returned in two or three minutes.  \"There are four feet of water in it, sir.\"  \"Four feet! Are you sure?\" the captain exclaimed.  \"Quite sure, sir.\"  The captain handed over the command of the deck to the second officer, and went below with Reuben. First wiping the rod carefully, he sounded the well.  \"You are right,\" he said. \"It is three inches over the four feet. I fear that the bumping of the mizzen, before we got rid of it, must have started a butt. She could hardly have made so much water from straining.\"  The captain made his way aft. The saloon was empty; the passengers, one by one, had retired to their cabins. He knocked at the doors of Mr. Mason and the chief warder.  \"The ship is making water fast,\" he said. \"We must rig the main-deck pumps. I can't spare any of the crew, their hands are full. Will you set the convicts to work?\"  In a few minutes the clank of the pumps was heard. Very irregularly were they worked, for it was next to impossible for the men to stand to them, with the vessel throwing herself about so wildly.  The captain had remained on deck. He placed his hand on the shrouds of the main mast. One moment they hung loosely; and then, as the vessel rolled over, tightened themselves, with a sudden jerk, till they were as stiff as iron rods. He shook his head.  \"Reuben, make your way up to the chief officer, and tell him that I am going to get rid of the main-top mast. Tell him to see that everything is cut free from the fore mast.\"  Reuben made his way aloft with difficulty. It needed all his strength to prevent the wind from tearing him from his grasp of the shrouds, but at length he reached the fore top, where the mate was at work. He delivered the captain's message.  \"Ask the captain to wait five minutes, till I get the back stay secured. I will send a man down, as soon as I am ready.\"  \"You take this axe,\" the captain said, when Reuben regained the deck, \"and stand by this stay. When you see me ready to cut the other, cut at the same moment.\"  In a few minutes Bill came down, with a message to the captain that all was ready. The latter raised his arm to Reuben. He waited till the vessel rolled over, and then lifted his axe. The two blows fell together on the stays. A moment later the vessel began to rise again. As the jerk came there was a crash above, and the main-top mast fell over the side, clear of the deck, having snapped off at the cap like a pipe stem.  \"Thank God for that,\" the captain said, as he cut away the connections on the other side, and the spar drifted astern, \"that is off our minds.\"  The loss of the main-top mast and mizzen greatly relieved the strain on the ship, and she worked much easier. In half an hour, the first officer returned on deck with his party, and reported that he had done all he could to secure the fore mast.  \"The sea is becoming more regular,\" the captain said, \"now that we are getting further away from the centre of the storm. We shall soon have the waves racing behind us, like mountains, and we shall have to shake out the fore sail to keep ahead of them. Now, let us see how they are getting on below.\"  The well was again sounded, and it was found that the water had gained two or three inches.  \"When the motion gets a little more regular, Reuben, you must take two or three hands, and work your way aft in the hold, and try and find out where the water is coming in.\"  \"I will go at once, sir, if you like.\"  \"No,\" the captain replied, \"it must not be thought of. Everything will be adrift, and you would be crushed to death, to a certainty. You must wait till we are out of this tumble. If the water gains no faster than it does now, two or three hours will make no material difference, and by that time I hope we shall have got a regular sea.\"  Finding that there was nothing for him to do, Reuben again turned in. The motion was still tremendous, but he could feel a sensible change from what it was before. The motion of the ship was less sudden and violent and, although she rolled tremendously, she rose each time with an easier motion.  An hour later the watch turned out, and the others took their place. The wind was blowing as heavily as when the hurricane began, but the aspect of the sea had changed. It was no longer a mass of leaping, tumbling water; but was running in long waves, following each other, rising high above the vessel's stern as they overtook her. Having lashed himself to the side, he remained for an hour watching the sea. The first mate then came up to him.  \"The captain thinks you might manage to get aft now. I will send Bill and Dick Whistler with you, to help you move any boxes or bales.\"  Reuben went back in the forecastle and got some tools, a piece of old sailcloth, and a large bundle of oakum; and then made his way with the two sailors down into the after hold. The way in which the upper tier of cargo lay heaped against the sides showed that it would, as the captain said, have been impossible to enter while the motion was at its worst. The rolling, however, had greatly diminished; the vessel rising and falling with a regular motion, as each wave passed under her. The men each carried a lantern and, with some difficulty, made their way to the stern.  \"Ay, it's somewhere about here,\" Bill said. \"I can hear the rushing of water, somewhere below. Now, the first thing is to move these bales.\"  They worked for a time, and then Bill returned on deck to fetch two more hands. They brought hand spikes and bars, as the bales were wedged so tightly together that it was difficult, in the extreme, to move them. It took two hours' hard work before they reached the leak. As the captain had supposed, the head of one of the planks had been started, at the stern post, by a blow from the wreck of the mizzen; and the water was rushing in with great force.  \"A few hours of this would have settled her,\" Bill said. \"All the pumps in the ship would not keep down such a leak as this.\"  Reuben at once set to work, cutting a deep groove in the stern post. He butted some stout pieces of wood into this, and wedged the other ends firmly against the first rib. Then he set to work to jam down sail cloth and oakum between this barrier and the plank that had started, driving it down with a marlinespike and mallet. It was a long job, but it was securely done; and at last Reuben had the satisfaction of seeing that a mere driblet of water was making its way down, behind the stuffing, into the ship.  \"That's a first-rate job, lad,\" Bill said approvingly. \"Half an hour's work once a week will keep her dry, if there is no water finds its way in anywhere else.\"  Reuben went aft to the well. The pump was now working steadily, the gangs of convicts relieving each other by turns. On sounding the well, he found that the water had fallen nine inches since he had last ascertained its depth. Going on deck, he found that a misty light filled the air, and that morning was breaking.  The captain had two or three times come down to the hold, to watch the progress of the work. Reuben reported to him its completion, and the fall in the water.  \"Yes, it's been falling the last hour,\" the captain said. \"She will do now. But she's making water, still. Some of the seams must have opened. I have been looking her over, and can't find out where it is; and we can do nothing until the gale has blown itself out, and we can get below and shift the cargo.\"  Reuben found that the fore sail had been set while he was below; and the vessel was running, some twelve knots an hour, before the wind. At one moment she was in a deep valley, then her stern mounted high on a following wave, and she seemed as if she must slide down, head foremost. Higher and higher the wave rose, sending her forward with accelerated motion; then it passed along her, and she was on a level keel on its top, and seemed to stand almost still as the wave passed from under her.  In spite of the extra lashing which had been given, the hen coops, spars, and everything loose upon the decks had been swept away; and the bulwarks had, in several places, been stove in. The galley had been carried away, but the cook had just made a shift to boil a cauldron of coffee below, and a mug of this was served out to all hands. As Reuben broke a biscuit into his portion, and sipped it, he thought he had never enjoyed a meal so much. He had now been, for eighteen hours, wet through to the skin; and the coffee sent a warm glow through him.  The captain ordered all hands, save a few absolutely required on deck, to turn in; and Reuben was soon in a glow of warmth beneath his blankets and, lulled by the now easy motion of the ship, was fast asleep in a few minutes.  After four hours' sleep, he was again on deck. The gale was blowing as strongly as ever, three men were at the helm, and the vessel was still tearing along at great speed. Several of the male passengers were on the poop, and the contrast between the appearance of the Paramatta at the same hour on the previous day, and that which she presented now, struck Reuben very strongly. Sadly, indeed, she looked with mizzen mast gone, the main mast shortened to the cap, and all the upper spars and rigging of the fore mast gone. She was, however, making good weather of it, for her hold was now so dry that the pumps were worked only on alternate hours, and the relief afforded by the loss of all her top hamper was very great.  For a week the Paramatta ran before the gale. At the end of the fourth day its force somewhat abated, but it still blew much too hard for anything to be done towards getting up fresh spars; while the lost mizzen rendered it impossible for them to bring her up into the wind.  \"It's bitterly cold, Bill,\" Reuben said. \"Its been getting colder every day, but this morning it is really bitter.\"  \"And no wonder, lad, seeing that we have been racing south for pretty nigh a week. We have been making a little easting, but that is all, and we are getting into the region of ice. We may see some bergs any time now.\"  \"I should like to see an iceberg,\" Reuben said.  \"The fewer we see of them the better,\" Bill replied, \"for they are about as nasty customers as you want to meet. I expected we should have seen them before, but this gale must have blown them south a bit. They work up with the northwesterly current, but I expect the wind will have carried them back against it. No, I don't want to see no icebergs.\"  \"But if it were a very big one, we might get under its lee and repair damages a bit, Bill. Might we not?\"  \"No, my lad. The lee of an iceberg ain't a place one would choose, if one could help it. There you are becalmed under it, and the berg drifting down upon you, going perhaps four knots an hour. No, the farther you keep away from icebergs the better. But if you have got to be near one, keep to windward of it. At least, that's my 'speryence.  \"They have been having some trouble with the convicts, I hears. They worked well enough at first, as long as they knew that there was a lot of water in the hold; but since then they have been a-grumbling, and last night I hear there was a rumpus, and six of them was put in irons. That's the first of it, and the sooner the gale's over, and we shapes our course in smooth water for Sydney heads, the better I shall be pleased.\"  An hour later, Bill pointed to the sky ahead.  \"Do yer see nothing odd about that 'ere sky?\"  \"No,\" Reuben replied, \"except that it's very light coloured.\"  \"Ay, that's it, my lad. That's what they call the ice blink. You see if we ain't in the middle of bergs before night comes on. I have not been whaling for nothing.\"  A few minutes later, the first mate was heard to be shouting orders.  \"Just as I thought,\" Bill said. \"We are going to try to rig a jury mizzen, so as to help us claw off the ice, if need be.\"  A spare top mast was got up from below. Guys were fixed to one end and, with the help of the marines and a party of convicts, the spar was raised alongside the stump of the mizzen mast; and was there lashed securely, the guys being fastened as stays to the bulwarks. Blocks had been tied to the top, before it was raised; and ropes rove into them; and a try sail was brought on deck, and laid ready for hoisting.  The first mate ascended to the fore top, and at once hailed the deck that ice was visible ahead. The captain joined him, and for some minutes the two officers carefully examined the horizon. No sooner did the captain regain the deck than he ordered the try sail to be hoisted on the jury mast, and a haul to be given upon the braces of the fore sail, while the ship's course was laid a little north of east.  \"It is lucky the wind has gone down as much as it has,\" he remarked to Mr. Hudson. \"The sea is still heavy but, if that jury mizzen stands, we shall be able to claw off the ice.\"  \"Is there much of it, captain?\"  \"We could see a good many bergs and, from the look of the sky, I should say there was an ice field lying beyond them. However, I think we shall do, if the wind does not freshen again. If it does, we must do our best to make a group of islands lying down to the southeast, and there refit. They are a rendezvous for whalers, in summer.\"  \"Why not do so now, captain?\"  \"I would, if it were not for the convicts. But, unless as a last resource, I would not run the risk of touching at any island with them on board. As long as we are at sea they are comparatively harmless and, unless there is gross carelessness on the part of their guard, there is little fear of an outbreak. But once let them get on land, the matter is changed altogether. They are nearly three to one as against the warders, marines, and crew; and I would not run the risk, on any account, if it can be possibly avoided. No, no, Mr. Hudson, unless it be a matter of life and death, we will put in nowhere till we are in Sydney harbour.\"    Chapter 9: Two Offers.   At nightfall the Paramatta was in the midst of the icebergs, and Reuben soon understood the antipathy which Bill had expressed for them. As a spectacle, they were no doubt grand; but as neighbours to a half-crippled ship, with half a gale blowing, their beauty was a very secondary consideration to those on board.  Additional stays were fixed to the jury mast, as it might be necessary, at any moment, to attempt to bring her up into the wind; and the word was passed that both watches must remain on deck. Fortunately the night was a light one, for the moon was up, and the sky almost cloudless. The mate stood with two of the best hands at the wheel; while the second mate took his place in the fore top, with a lantern, to signal the position of ice ahead. Fortunately there were but few small floating blocks about, and the Paramatta threaded her way through the larger bergs, without once approaching near enough to render danger imminent. It was a long and anxious night but, when morning broke, it was seen that the sea was now open ahead, and by the afternoon they had left the last berg behind.  Two days later the wind went completely down, and the crew at once set to work to repair damages. Reuben, with two men under him, filled up the breaches in the bulwarks. A respectable jury mast was rigged by the stump of the main mast; and the spar, which had done such good service among the bergs, was replaced by a longer and heavier one. All hands worked vigorously, and the sailors were assisted in the heavier work by parties of convicts.  After two days' toil all was completed. Sail was hoisted again and, under a greatly reduced spread of canvas to that which she had carried before the gale burst, the Paramatta proceeded on her way. The weather continued favourable and, without further adventure, the Paramatta arrived off Sydney heads; having made the voyage in a hundred and three days, which was, under the circumstances, a quick one.  The last evening Captain Wilson asked Reuben to go with him to the poop, as he and Mr. Hudson wanted to have a chat with him.  \"Now, Reuben,\" Mr. Hudson said, \"sit yourself down here. We must have a talk together. Now we want to know exactly what you are thinking of doing.\"  \"I am thinking of getting work, sir,\" Reuben said, \"at my own trade.\"  \"Well, my lad, I don't think you will make much at that. There are mills, of course, but not a great many of them; and I fancy you would find it difficult to get anything like regular work. The distances here are tremendous, and you would spend the money you made, in one job, in looking out for another.  \"That is the first view of the case. The second is, that neither Captain Wilson nor I mean to let you try it. You have saved my daughter's life, and I am not going to let the man who did that tramp about the country, looking for a day's work. Captain Wilson is going to marry my girl shortly, and of course he feels just the same about it. So the next question is, 'What is the best thing we can do for you?' Now, if you have a fancy for squatting, you can come with me up country and learn the business; and this day, twelve-month, I will hand you over the deeds of a range, with five thousand sheep upon it. Now, that's my offer.  \"Now, don't you be in a hurry to refuse it, and don't let me have any nonsense about your not liking to accept it. Ten such farms would not pay the debt I owe you, and I tell you I should think it downright mean, if you were to refuse to let me pay you a part of my debt. Now you shall hear Wilson's proposal.\"  \"My offer is not so brilliant, Reuben. Indeed, as far as making money, the pay would probably be no higher, at first, than you might earn at your trade. I am, as you know, assistant superintendent to the constabulary force of the colony. Now, if you like, I will obtain you a commission as an inspector. The pay is not high, but by good conduct you may rise to a position such as I hold. It is the position of a gentleman, and the life is full of excitement and adventure. Now, what do you say?\"  Reuben was silent for a minute or two.  \"I am greatly obliged to you both,\" he said, \"more obliged than I can tell you. Your offer, Mr. Hudson, is a most generous one; but I have not been accustomed to farming, and I would rather have such a life as that which Captain Wilson offers me, although the pay may be very much smaller.  \"But, sir,\" he said, turning to the officer of constabulary, \"I fear that I cannot accept your offer, because, in the first place, you see, I am not a gentleman.\"  \"Oh, nonsense, Reuben! Your manners and language would pass you as a gentleman, anywhere. Besides which, there are several officers in the force who have risen from the ranks, and who have had nothing like the education you have had. You can put that aside at once. Is there any other reason?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Reuben said quietly. \"I had never intended to have spoken of it, and I came out to Australia in order that I might be away from everyone who knew the story, but I couldn't accept your offer without your knowing it. I am leaving England because I have been tried for burglary.\"  \"Nonsense!\" both Reuben's listeners exclaimed, incredulously.  \"If you don't mind, I will tell you the whole story,\" Reuben said, \"and then you can judge for yourselves.\"  Reuben then related at length the whole circumstances, with which the reader is already acquainted.  \"I remember reading your story in the papers, Reuben,\" Captain Wilson said. \"Being in the force, you know, I take an interest in these things. I own I was puzzled at the time--because, you see, I did not know you--but how anyone who did know you, could think you guilty, passes my comprehension.\"  \"I call it infamous,\" Mr. Hudson added warmly. \"They must be a pack of fools, down at that place Lewes.\"  \"Well,\" Captain Wilson said, \"I am glad you have told me your story; for I have all along been puzzled as to what made you give up your trade, and emigrate, at your age. However, the matter is explained now; but now you have told me, I see no reason whatever why you should not accept my offer. In the first place, no one but ourselves will know your history. In the next, if they did so, that is no reason why you should not hold the appointment. No man is free from the risk of being suspected unjustly. You have been acquitted by a jury of your countrymen and, even did everyone know it, no one dare throw it in your teeth.  \"No, I repeat, if you like I have no doubt that I can obtain for you an appointment as officer in the constabulary. You need not give me an answer now. Think it over for a week. You will have plenty of time, for Mr. Hudson insists upon your taking up your abode with him, when you land.\"  \"That I do,\" Mr. Hudson said. \"I have a place a mile out of Sydney, and there you will stop for a bit. Then I hope you will go up the country with me, for a month or two, and learn the ways of the place; till Captain Wilson has got an appointment for you--that is, if you quite decide to accept his offer, instead of mine. But remember, if ever you get tired of thief hunting, the offer will still be open to you.\"  Sydney was at that time but a very small place; for the great wave of emigrants had not yet begun to flow, and the colony was in its early infancy. As soon as the vessel cast anchor, Mr. Hudson and his party landed, taking Reuben with them; and an hour later he found himself installed, as a guest, at the squatter's house.  It was large and comfortable, surrounded by a broad verandah, and standing in a garden blooming with flowers, many of which were wholly unknown to Reuben. He had, of course, before landing laid aside the suit he had worn on board ship, and had dressed himself in his best; and the heartiness and cordiality of his host, his wife, and daughter soon made him feel perfectly at his ease.  \"We are in the rough, you know,\" Mr. Hudson said to him. \"Everyone is in the rough here, at present. Twenty years hence things may settle down, but now we all have to take them as we find them. The chief difficulty is servants. You see, almost every other man here is either a convict, an ex-convict, or a runaway sailor; about as bad material as you could want to see, for the formation of what they call at home a genteel establishment. The number of emigrants who come out is small. For the most part they have a little money and take up land, or at any rate, go up country and look for work there. A few, of course, who have been sent out by their friends at home to get rid of them, loaf about Sydney and spend their money, till they are driven to take the first job that offers. Well, they may do for shepherds, in places where no drink is to be had for love or money, but you would scarcely care about having them as butlers; so you see, we are driven to the three classes I spoke of. I have been exceptionally lucky. The man who carried the things upstairs just now, and who is my chief man here, is an ex-convict.\"  Reuben looked surprised.  \"He was assigned to me when he first got his ticket of leave. I found him a good hand, and he stood by me pluckily, when my station was attacked by the blacks. So next time I came down to the town, I asked what he had been sent out here for. I found it was for having been concerned in a poaching fray, in which some of the game keepers got badly hurt. Well, that wasn't so much against him, you know, so I got talking to him one day, and found out that he came from my part of England. I found he had a wife, so I sent home money to some friends, and asked them to send her out; which they did and, finding she had, before she married him, been cook in a gentleman's family, I engaged her here, and sent up the country for Watson to come down. I had told him nothing about it; for I thought, perhaps, his wife might refuse to come out, or might have married again, or anything else.  \"Well, the meeting was a happy one, as you may suppose; and I then settled him down here--at least, it wasn't here, but a smaller place I had then--and he has been with me ever since. His time was out some years ago, but that has made no difference. Nothing would induce him to leave me; and I would not part with him for any amount, for a more faithful and trusty fellow never lived, and when I go away I know everything will go along like clockwork. As for his wife, she's a treasure, and she knows how to cook a dinner, as you will acknowledge presently.  \"They form the mainstay of my establishment. Besides that, there's an old chap who looks after the garden, goes down to the town, and does odd jobs. He was a sailor. He was landed here when his vessel came into port, five years ago. He had fallen off the yard on to the deck, and had broken half his ribs. He was taken to the government hospital. They did not think, at first, that he would ever get over it; but though he pulled through, it was clear he would never be fit for any hard work. So the surgeon of the hospital spoke of the case to me, and I said I thought I could find a job that would suit him, and here he has been. He is quite strong enough for all the work I want him to do, and I can trust him about the place. Of course, he breaks out and gets drunk occasionally, but one cannot expect to find a man perfect.  \"Then there is a black boy--they call them all boys here--he looks after the horses, and has two black boys--they are boys--under him. I found him out on the plains. He had been shot by some bush-ranging scoundrels, out of pure mischief, I should say. He was insensible when I found him, but I saw that he was alive, and managed to get him up on my horse and took him home. We were six weeks getting him round, for the bullet had gone through his body. It would have killed a white man in an hour, but these black fellows are as hard as nails.  \"My wife nursed him, for she was living up the country with me at that time; and when he got well, he declared that he would never leave us. I don't know that I was much gratified at the news, at first; but I soon found out that Sam, as I called him, was a valuable fellow about a place. He could turn his hand to everything, but I found he was specially happy when he was engaged about the horses; so at last I handed over that department to him, and when we set up this place here, I brought him down with me and made him head of the stables. It's fifteen years since I first picked him up, and I don't think I have ever had cause to find fault with him, since.  \"So you see, though my establishment can't be called a genteel, it's a thoroughly good-working one, and I doubt if there's a man in the colony who is as well off as I am.  \"When we go up country they all go with me except the sailor, who remains in charge. He's a great man, I can tell you, when he's left in what he calls command of the ship. He's got hold of two old muskets and a brace of pistols, and these he always loads before we start, so as to be ready to repel boarders. He looks out sharply, too, for I have never lost a thing since he came; and when you consider what a number of gentry there are, about here, with experience in housebreaking, I think that's pretty well. He is always drunk and incapable, for three or four days after our return, as a reward to himself for having kept from drink all the time we are away.\"  \"Dinner is ready,\" Frances Hudson said, running into the room. \"Here you are, papa, talking away as usual, whenever you get the chance. Now run upstairs quickly, both of you; for Rachel will not be pleased if you let the first dinner get cold, after she has been doing her best to turn out something special, in honour of the occasion, ever since she heard the Paramatta was in port.\"  \"I won't be a minute, Frances.  \"Ah, here comes Wilson. I was wondering what had become of him. He promised to come on, as soon as he had seen his chief.\"  The dinner was an excellent one, and fully bore out Mr. Hudson's assertion with respect to his cook. All were in high spirits, with the exception of Mrs. Hudson, who was cool in her manners to the young officer, and was evidently desirous of showing her disapproval of his engagement to her daughter, which had only taken place two days before.  \"I have news for you, Reuben,\" Captain Wilson said, in the first pause of conversation. \"I saw the chief, and told him I wanted an appointment for a young friend of mine, who had come out in the Paramatta, and who had shown great pluck and presence of mind in an affair at the Cape, which I described to him. He said that he could appoint you at once, as young Houghton, a district superintendent, was killed three weeks ago, in an affair with the bush rangers up country. He said he was very glad to hear of someone likely to make a good officer, to fill his place. So if you make up your mind to be a constable, the place is ready for you.\"  \"Thank you very much, sir,\" Reuben said, \"I was thinking the matter over last night, and quite made up my mind to accept the place you were kind enough to offer me, if you think me fit to fill it.\"  \"I have no fear on that score, Reuben. I am sure you will do credit to my recommendation. So then, we may consider that as settled.\"  \"There,\" grumbled Mr. Hudson, \"that's just like you, Wilson; you upset all my plans. It was arranged he was to come up to my station, and there, before you are on shore two hours, you arrange the whole business; and I suppose you will be wanting him to get into his uniform, and be off before a week's out.\"  \"I daresay we can manage a fortnight,\" Captain Wilson laughed, \"and I have no doubt he will have plenty of opportunities for visiting you, later on. Indeed, I don't know why he should not be able to look you up, as soon as you get there. He will, of course, be placed under an old hand for six months, to learn his duties and get to speak a little of the native lingo.  \"Hartwell, who has your district, is as good a man as he can be put with. He is a careful officer, though perhaps a little slow; but he will be a good man for Reuben to serve under, and I know the chief will put him with him if I ask him, as it can't make any difference where he goes first.\"  \"Well, if you can arrange that, Wilson, I will forgive you. And now, where are you going to?\"  \"For the time, I am not going anywhere in particular,\" Captain Wilson replied. \"The chief says he thinks that things have got rather slack, since I have been away. There are several bands of bush rangers, who have been doing a deal of mischief up country; so to begin with, he wishes me to make a tour of inspection, and to report generally. After that, I think I shall be settled here for a time. At any rate, it will be my headquarters. I think it probable the chief himself will be going home on leave, before very long.\"  \"The sooner you are settled here, the better,\" Mr. Hudson said; \"for I know I shall get no peace, now, till Frances is settled, too. Ever since she was a child, when she once made up her mind that she wanted a new toy, she worried me till I got it for her; and you are the last new toy.\"  \"Oh, papa, how can you say so!\" Frances said, laughing and colouring. \"As far as I am concerned, it may be months and months.\"  \"Oh, that is all very well,\" Mr. Hudson broke in. \"I know what you want. You want Wilson here to be always, neglecting his duty, and galloping over from the other end of the colony to see you. No, no, my dear, if Wilson is a wise fellow, he will bring you to book, as soon as I can either build, or get hold of, a place fit for you. We shall be having no peace, now. Every time he is off on duty, you will be picturing him as engaged in some dreadful struggle with bush rangers and blacks; and if letters don't come as often as you expect them, you will be fretting yourself into a fever.\"  \"What nonsense, papa! I know, of course, George will have to do his duty. I don't suppose he's always going to be tied to my apron string.\"  \"You take my advice, Reuben,\" Mr. Hudson said, \"don't you go and lose your heart; for if you once do, there's a police officer spoiled. It don't so much matter with Wilson, because he has done his share of dangerous work, and is pretty well up at the top of the tree; but a man that has to tackle bush rangers and blacks, ought not to have a woman at home thinking of him.\"  \"There is no fear of that, for a good many years to come,\" Reuben laughed. \"Are these blacks really formidable fellows, Captain Wilson?\"  \"Formidable to the settlers,\" Captain Wilson said, \"but not to us. They drive off cattle and sheep, and sometimes attack solitary stations, and murder every soul there; but they seldom stand up in fair fight, when we come down upon them; but they fight hard, sometimes, when they are acting with bush rangers.\"  \"Bush rangers are mostly escaped convicts, are they not?\"  \"Almost always,\" Captain Wilson replied, \"except that, of course, they have among them a few men such as runaway sailors, and ne'er-do-wells who get sick of shepherding and take to the bush; but the great proportion are convicts. It is not to be wondered at, when you look at the life many of these men have led at home, and the monotony and hardship of their lives in many of the up-country stations, allotted to men as ignorant, and sometimes almost as brutal as themselves.  \"Some of them, too, escape from the road gangs, and these are generally the worst; for as often as not, they may have killed a warder in making their escape, and know that it will go hard with them if they are caught.  \"It may be said that there are two sorts of bush rangers. The one are men who have taken to the bush, simply from a desire of regaining their liberty. Sometimes they join parties of blacks, and live with them. Sometimes two or three get together, and all the harm they do is to carry off an occasional sheep, for food. And the other kind are desperadoes--men who were a scourge in England, and are a scourge here, who attack lonely stations, and are not content with robbing, but murder those who fall into their hands.  \"They are in fact wild beasts, to whom no mercy is to be extended; and who, knowing it, will fight to the last. They are not easy to hunt down, their instinct having made them wary; and being generally in league with the blacks, who are as cunning as foxes, and can run pretty nearly as fast as a horse can gallop, they are kept very well informed as to our movements and, the country being so immense, we should never run them down, were it not for our native trackers.  \"These fellows are to the full as sharp as the Red Indians of North America. They seem, in fact, to have the instinct of dogs, and can follow a track when the keenest white's eye cannot detect the smallest trace of a footprint. It is something marvellous what some of them will do.\"  \"Have you many of these trackers in your employment?\"  \"There are one or two attached to every up-country station. They are, in fact, our bloodhounds; and although some of our men pick up a little of their craft, we should do nothing without them.\"  The next morning, Reuben met Captain Wilson down in Sydney, and was taken by him to the chief of the constabulary, who at once made out his appointment. On his return, Mr. Hudson again started with him for the town, and insisted upon ordering his equipment. As Reuben saw that he would be hurt by any shadow of denial, he accepted Mr. Hudson's kind offer; although he had intended to ask Captain Wilson to make an advance of pay, in order that he might get what was necessary. He could not, however, have purchased such an outfit as Mr. Hudson insisted on getting for him; the latter ordering not only uniforms but suits of plain clothes, together with saddlery, holsters, a sword, and a brace of excellent double-barrelled pistols. He did not need to buy a horse, having in his stables one in every way suitable, being at once quiet and fast--it was, indeed, one of the most valuable animals in the colony.  \"You will have to keep your eyes open, Reuben,\" he said, as he gave him the horse, \"or he will be stolen from you. These bush ranger fellows are always well mounted, and anyone at an up-country station, who has an animal at all out of the ordinary way, has to keep his stable door locked and sleep with one eye open; and even then, the chances are strongly in favour of his losing his horse, before long. These fellows know that their lives often depend upon the speed of their horse and, naturally, spare no pains to get hold of a good one.  \"Ah, I have a good idea.  \"Jim,\" he shouted to one of the black boys, \"come here.\"  The lad, who was about eighteen years of age, trotted up.  \"Jim, this gentleman is going to be a police officer, and he's going to take the bay with him; now he wants a good servant. Will you go with him?\"  The lad looked longingly at the horse, which he had groomed and was very fond of; but he shook his head.  \"I no leave Massa Hudson.\"  \"Yes, but I wish you to go, Jim. This gentleman is a great friend of mine, and when bad black man attacked young Missy, he saved her life. So I want him to be taken good care of; and the horse, too, and to see no one steals it. So someone I can trust must go with him. If you don't like him for a master, after you have tried him, Jim, you can come back to me again. You have been a good boy, and I have no wish to get rid of you; but this gentleman don't know the ways of the country, and I want to be sure he has someone with him he can trust.\"  The lad looked at Reuben gravely, with his small eyes deeply sunken under the projecting eyebrows.  \"Jim will go,\" he said. \"He look after white man and Tartar, to please Massa Hudson and young Missy.\"  \"That's right, Jim,\" his employer said.  \"That's a good stroke of business,\" he went on, as he turned away with Reuben; \"if you treat these black fellows well, and they get attached to you, they are faithful to death.\"  \"You will see that fellow will never let your horse out of his sight. If you ride twenty miles across country, there he will be by your side as you dismount, ready to take it, and looking as fresh as paint. At night he will sleep in the stable, and will be ready, at all times and places, to make a fire, and cook a damper or a bit of meat, if you are lucky enough to have one by you. All the people about the place would do anything, I believe, for Frances; and the fact that you have saved her life will bind this boy to you, at first. Afterwards he will get to care for you, for yourself.\"  A fortnight later Reuben, in his uniform as an officer of the constabulary, rode out of Sydney. His baggage had been sent on, three days before, by a waggon returning up country. Jim trotted, with an easy stride, behind him. Reuben at first was inclined to ride slowly, in order to give his attendant time to keep up with him; but he soon found that, whatever pace he went, the lad kept the same distance behind, without any apparent exertion; and he was, therefore, able to choose his own pace, without reference to Jim's comfort.  Four years passed. Reuben Whitney gave every satisfaction to his superiors, and was considered a zealous and effective young officer. So far he had not been placed in a position of great responsibility; for although for the last two years he had been in charge of a district, it was not far from Sydney, and his duties consisted principally in hunting for convicts who had made their escape, in looking after refractory ticket-of-leave men, and in ordinary constabulary work. He had learned in that time to become a first-rate rider, and a good shot with a pistol, accomplishments which would be of vital service when he was ordered to an up-country station. For his pistols he had as yet, however, had no actual use, as neither bush rangers nor natives penetrated so far into the settlement.  At the end of the four years' service, he received a letter from Captain Wilson, who had just succeeded to the chief command of the constabulary, ordering him to hand over charge of the district to the young officer who was the bearer of the letter, and to report himself at headquarters.  Reuben was now nearly three-and-twenty, and had grown into a very powerful young man. A life spent for the most part on horseback had hardened his muscles, and filled out his frame. He stood about five feet nine, but looked shorter, owing to his great width of shoulders. He was still quiet in manner, but he had the same bright and pleasant expression which had characterized him as a boy; and his visits to Sydney, where he was introduced by Captain Wilson and Mr. Hudson into the best society, had given him ease and self possession.  The native, Jim, was still with him. He had become greatly attached to his master, and his fidelity and devotion had been of the greatest service to him and, go where he would, the black was always at his heels.  On his presenting himself at Sydney, Captain Wilson said, after the first greetings:  \"I know you have been a little disappointed, Reuben, because hitherto you have been at stations where you have had but little opportunity of distinguishing yourself. However, I thought better to keep you at quiet work, until you were thoroughly master of your duties; and had, moreover, got your full strength. I don't know whether you have quite arrived at that yet, but I think you will do, anyhow,\" and he smiled as he looked at Reuben's shoulders.  \"I think I am as strong as most of them,\" Reuben said, smiling too. \"Four years' mill-wright's work, and four years on horseback in this bracing air, ought to make one strong, if there's anything in one to begin with. I think I shall do, in that respect.\"  \"I think so, Reuben. I don't think there are many men in the force who could hold their own with you, in a grapple.  \"And now to business. You have heard of that affair of Inspector Thomas, in the Goora district--it was a bad business. He and two of his men were out, after some natives who had driven off cattle; and he was set upon by a party of bush rangers, and he and his men killed.\"  \"So I heard, sir,\" Reuben said quietly.  \"Well, I have decided in sending you up in his place. It is a bad district--the worst we have, at present--and it needs a man of great resolution, and intelligence. I am sure that you have plenty of both, and that I cannot make a better choice than in sending you there. Your age is the only thing against you--not with me, you know, but others may think that I have done wrong, in selecting so young an officer--but you see, I know my man. I know, too, that several of the inspectors are getting too old for this sort of work. I do not mean too old, perhaps, in point of years, but they are married men with families, and for desperate work I prefer men without encumbrances.  \"The post should be held by an inspector, but I cannot promote you, at present. It would be putting you over the heads of too many. But you will have a good chance of earning early promotion, and I know that is what you like.\"  \"Thank you very much, Captain Wilson. I will do my best to show myself worthy of your confidence.\"  \"You will have all your work cut out for you, Reuben. The district has, all along, been a most troublesome one. The number of settlers, at present, is small. There is a good deal of higher bush than usual about it, which makes it very difficult to run these fellows down; and the natives are specially troublesome. Besides which, at present there are two or three of the worst gangs of bush rangers in the colony, somewhere in that country. You will have to be cautious as well as bold, Reuben. It is a dangerous service I am sending you on; still, the more danger, the more credit to you.\"  \"You could not have given me a station I should have liked better; and I hope, ere long, I may be able to give you a good account of the bush rangers.\"  \"And now, Reuben, if you will call again in an hour, I shall be free, and then I will drive you home. You need not start for a day or two; and you will, of course, stay with me till you do.\"    Chapter 10: An Up-Country District.   Mrs. Wilson received Reuben, as usual, with the greatest cordiality; but she exclaimed loudly, when she heard that he was going to the Goora district.  \"You don't mean it, George. You can't mean that you are going to send Reuben to that dreadful place. Why, we are always hearing of murders and robberies there; and you know the last inspector was killed; and the one before recalled, because you said he had lost his nerve; and now you are sending Reuben there!\"  \"But I look upon it as the greatest honour, Mrs. Wilson, being chosen for such a station; and you see, there will be capital chances of distinguishing myself, and getting promoted.\"  \"And capital chances of being killed,\" Mrs. Wilson said, in a vexed tone. \"I do call it too bad, George.\"  \"But, my dear, we want a man of pluck and energy. Besides, you know, we have been getting into hot water over that district. The press have been saying very severe things, about our incompetence to protect the outlying settlements, and I was obliged to choose a man who will give satisfaction; and you will agree with me that Reuben will do that.\"  \"Of course he will,\" Mrs. Wilson agreed. \"I shouldn't be alive now, if he hadn't had plenty of pluck and energy; but for that very reason, you ought not to send him to such a dangerous post.\"  \"But I wish to give him an opportunity for distinguishing himself. He wants to get on, and I want to push him on; but you see, I can't promote him over the heads of some eight or ten men, senior to him, unless he does something a little out of the way.\"  \"Well, I don't like it, George, I tell you frankly. I always thought he was wrong, to go into the constabulary at all, instead of accepting papa's offer. I can't think why you men are so fond of fighting, when you could choose a quiet and comfortable life.\"  \"But it is not always so quiet and comfortable, Frances, as a good many have found, in the district he is going to; and after all, it is less dangerous fighting bush rangers and natives when you are prepared for it, than to be woke up of a night with a band of them thundering at your door, and with no assistance within twenty miles.\"  As Frances Wilson remembered how, in her childish days, her father's place had been, for three days, beset with blacks, she had no answer ready for the argument.  \"Well, I do hope, Reuben,\" she said, \"if you do go to this horrid place, you will take care of yourself, and not be rash.\"  \"He's going to take care of others, Frances. You know, if he had taken care of himself and hadn't been rash, you would not have come so well out of that Malay business. I am sure he looks as if he could take care of himself, doesn't he?\"  \"Yes, he is big enough and strong enough,\" Mrs. Wilson agreed, \"but that's no good against spears or boomerangs, to say nothing of rifles and pistols.\"  \"Why, Frances, you are not generally a croaker,\" her husband said lightly, \"but for once, you seem to be determined to do your best to frighten Reuben, before he starts.\"  Mrs. Wilson laughed.  \"No, I don't want to frighten him, George. I only want to make him careful.\"  \"I will be as careful as I can, Mrs. Wilson. That boy Jim is a treasure. I will warrant, if there are any black fellows about, he will sniff them out somehow. That fellow has a nose like a hound. He has always been most useful to me, but he will be invaluable at Goora.\"  Two days afterwards, Reuben left for his new command. It took him eight days to reach it. His headquarters were at Goora, a settlement of some twenty houses; besides the barracks in which the constabulary force, consisting of a sergeant, eighteen constables, and two native trackers, were quartered. The sergeant, a north-country Irishman named O'Connor, was somewhat surprised when Reuben rode up to the station; for the officers previously in command had been much older men.  Reuben's own quarters were in a cottage, close to the main building, and he asked the sergeant to come, in the evening.  \"Now, sergeant,\" he said, after a little preliminary talk, \"I have been sent up by Captain Wilson, with instructions to root out these bands of bush rangers.\"  The sergeant smiled grimly.  \"We have been doing our best for the last three years, sir, but we have not made much of a hand at it.\"  \"No,\" Reuben agreed, \"and I don't suppose, of course, that I am going to succeed all at once. In the first place, tell me frankly, what sort of men have we got?\"  \"The men are good enough, sir, but they have certainly got disheartened, lately. One way and another, we have lost something like ten men in the last two years; and of course, that last affair with poor Mr. Thomas was a bad one.\"  \"I understand,\" Reuben said quietly, \"some of them are not quite so eager to meet the bush rangers as they used to be.\"  \"Well, that is perhaps about it, sir; but I must say the men have been tremendously hardly worked--pretty nigh night and day in the saddle, often called out by false news to one end of the district; and then to find, when they return, that those scoundrels have been down playing their games at some station at the other end. It's enough to dishearten a man.\"  \"So it is, sergeant. I was speaking to Captain Wilson about it, and saying that if we are to succeed we ought to have some fresh hands, who will take up the work with new spirit. We are seven below our force, at present; and he has promised to send me up fifteen new hands, so there will be eight to be relieved. I will leave it to you to pick out the men to go. Mind, put it to them that they are to be relieved simply because Captain Wilson thinks they have had their share of hard work, and should therefore be sent to a quiet station, for a time. Just pick out the men whom you think would be most pleased to go.\"  \"Very well, sir. I am glad to hear the news, for to tell you the truth, I do think we want a little fresh blood amongst us.\"  Three days later the new detachment arrived, and Reuben saw, at once, that Captain Wilson had chosen a picked set of young men. About half of them were freshly enlisted in the force. The others had all been employed at up-country stations, and were well acquainted with the nature of the work before them. The same afternoon, the eight men picked out by Sergeant O'Connor as being the least useful on the station started for Sydney, most of them well pleased at being relieved from their arduous duties.  Reuben found that there were, in the office, a great many letters from settlers, asking for protection. It was impossible to comply with all these but, after consultation with O'Connor, he sent five parties, of three men each, to as many exposed stations; keeping ten in hand, to move as required.  Taking Jim, and two of the constables who had been longest on the station, he spent two months in traversing his district, from end to end, and making himself thoroughly acquainted with its geographical features; for he felt that, until he had mastered these, he should only be working in the dark. For a time the outrages had ceased, the bush rangers having shifted their quarters, and the natives withdrawn after the murder of the late inspector. This was a great relief to Reuben, as it permitted him to gain an insight into the country before setting to work in earnest.  Upon his tour, he and his followers were everywhere most hospitably received at the stations at which they halted. Everywhere he heard the same tale of sheep killed, cattle and horses driven off, and the insolent demeanour of the natives.  \"I was thinking of giving it up, and moving back into the more populated districts,\" one of the settlers said to Reuben; \"but now you have come, I will hold on for a bit longer, and see how it turns out. You look to me the right sort of fellow for the post; but the difficulty is, with such a large scattered district as yours, to be everywhere at once. What I have often thought of, is that it would be a good thing if the whole district were to turn out, and go right into the heart of the black country, and give them a lesson.\"  \"From what I hear,\" Reuben said, \"it will be next to impossible for us to find them. The country is so vast, and covered with bush, that there would be no searching it. They have no fixed villages, and the want of water would render it impossible for us to go very far. But the worst point would be that they all seem to be well informed as to what is going on. I suppose they get warnings from the native herdsmen and servants, and if we were all together to enter their country, we must leave the stations unprotected, and we should find them in ashes, on our return.\"  \"Yes, that is true,\" the settler said. \"I suppose it couldn't be done. But it's anxious work sleeping here, night after night, with one's rifle by one's bedside, never certain at what hour one may be woke by the yelling of the blacks. But they are not as bad as the bush rangers. If the blacks can but drive off your cattle, they are contented. You have got nothing else that is much use to them. The bush rangers don't want your cattle, beyond a head or two for present use; but they want everything else you've got, and whether you like it or not is quite immaterial to them. Thank God I have got no money in the place, and I and my three men can make a pretty good fight of it. But I pity the men with wives and daughters.\"  \"Well, I hope we shall soon put a stop to it,\" Reuben said cheerfully. \"We will give them a lesson if we catch them, you may be quite sure.\"  \"I hope so,\" the settler said. \"But you folks have been mighty unlucky, lately. Never seem to have been at the right place at the right time. Not that I am surprised at that, in such a district; but somehow they never come up with the fellows, afterwards.\"  \"No, they seem to have had bad luck,\" Reuben agreed. \"I hope we shall do better now.\"  Three days after his return from his last visit of inspection of his district, a settler rode, at full speed, up to the station.  \"Captain,\" he said--for although Reuben had no right to that title, he was always so called by the settlers--\"the blacks have been down at my place. They have killed my two shepherds, and driven off the sheep.\"  \"Sergeant O'Connor, turn out the men at once,\" Reuben shouted. \"See that their ammunition is all right, and let each man take a water skin and four days' provisions in his haversack.  \"When was it?\" he asked, turning to the settler again.  \"Some time yesterday afternoon--at least, I judge so. One of the men was to have come in for supplies, and when night came and he hadn't come in, I began to be afraid something was wrong, for I knew that they were getting short. So this morning, at daybreak, I rode out with the hands I have about the house. We could see nothing of the sheep, so we rode straight to the men's hut. There, lying some twenty yards away, was the body of one of the men, riddled with spear holes. He had evidently been running to the hut for shelter, when he was overtaken. I did not stop to look for the other, for no doubt he had been killed, too.\"  \"Well, we will do what we can for you,\" Reuben said. \"I will be ready in five minutes.\"  He ran into the house, buckled on his sword, put some cold meat and a small bag of flour into his haversack, together with some dampers Jim had just cooked, and then went out again. Jim had already brought his horse round to the door. Before mounting he took the pistols out of the holsters, and examined them carefully.  By this time the sergeant and ten men were in the saddle, and placing himself at their head, with the settler, whose name was Blount, he rode off at full speed; followed by his men, the two native trackers, and Jim. Reuben soon reined his horse in.  \"It will not do to push them too hard, at first. There is no saying how far we shall have to go.\"  \"Do you mean to follow them into their own country?\" Mr. Blount asked.  \"I do,\" Reuben said. \"I will follow them till I catch them, if I have to go across Australia.\"  \"That's the sort,\" Mr. Blount said. \"I expect you will find half-a-dozen other fellows at my station, by the time you get there. I sent my hand off on horseback to the stations near, to tell them what had taken place, and that I had ridden off to you, and asking them to come round.\"  \"How far is it?\" Reuben asked.  \"About forty miles.\"  \"But your horse will never be able to do it,\" Reuben said.  \"I got a fresh horse at a friend's, four miles from your station, so I am all right.\"  \"They will have more than a day's start of us,\" Reuben remarked presently.  \"Yes; thirty-six hours, for you will have to stop at my place tonight. But they can't travel very fast with sheep, you know.\"  \"No,\" Reuben agreed. \"If they had had cattle, it would have been useless following them; but with sheep we may come up to them, especially if they don't think they will be followed far.\"  \"No; that's my hope. They will know I had forty miles to ride to your station. Besides, had it not been that I was expecting the shepherd in for supplies, I might not have found it out for two or three days. So I expect they will think that they are pretty safe from pursuit. They have never been followed far into the bush. It's nasty work, you see.\"  \"It's got to be done,\" Reuben said. \"It is impossible to keep guard everywhere, and the only way to put a stop to these outrages is to teach the blacks that punishment will follow, wherever they go.\"  It was late in the afternoon before they arrived at Mr. Blount's station. They found fourteen or fifteen of the neighbouring settlers gathered there. They came out as the sound of the trampling of the horses was heard. Several of them were known to Reuben, from his having stopped at their stations.  \"Glad to see you, captain, but I am afraid you are too late,\" said Dick Caister, a young settler whose station lay about twelve miles away.  \"That remains to be proved,\" Reuben replied, as he dismounted.  \"Oh, they have got twenty-four hours' start, and it's too late to do anything tonight. They must be thirty miles away in the bush, already.\"  \"If they were a hundred, I would follow them,\" Reuben said.  There was an exclamation of surprise, and something like a cheer, on the part of some of the younger men.  \"The difficulties are very great,\" one of the elder settlers said. \"There is neither food nor water to be found in the bush.\"  \"I know it's not an easy business,\" Reuben said quietly. \"But as to food, we can carry it with us; as to water, there must be water in places, for the natives can no more go without drinking than we can. There must be streams and water holes, here and there. But however difficult it is, I mean to attempt it. It is the only way of bringing the blacks to book; there can never be safety among the outlying settlements, unless the fellows are taught a lesson.  \"And now, gentlemen, before we go further, I want to say this: I know that you are all ready to help, that you are all thirsting to wipe out old scores with the blacks; but at the same time I would point out to you that it is likely enough that the bush rangers, who certainly work with the blacks, will follow up this stroke. Therefore, it will not do to leave the stations defenceless. I do not want a large force with me. If we once overtake the blacks, I have no fear whatever of being able to give a good account of them. Therefore I would urge, upon all of you who are married men, that it is of the first importance that you should stay at home, in case the bush rangers take the opportunity of our being away to pay you a visit. That is the first thing to be thought of. If any of the others like to go with us, I shall be very glad of their assistance. We may be away for a week or more, for ought I know.\"  \"That is certainly the best plan, captain,\" Dick Caister said. \"As you say, let the married men stop at home and guard their stations. I think the rest of us will all go with you.\"  There was a chorus of approval. Eight of those present were married men and, though reluctant to give up the thought of punishing the blacks, they were yet glad that they were not called upon to leave their wives and families. With many good wishes for the success of the expedition, they at once mounted, and rode off to their respective stations, some of which were more than twenty miles away.  \"Now for ways and means,\" Reuben said. \"What spare horses have you, Mr. Blount?\"  \"I have only two, besides the one I am riding.\"  \"I should like to take at least six. We must carry a good store of provisions.\"  \"I don't think you need trouble about that,\" Mr. Blount said. \"We must take a supply of flour with us, and of course tea and sugar; and a few bottles of rum will not be amiss. All these I can furnish. But as to meat, I do not think we need trouble. Going as fast as the blacks will travel, there are sure to be lots of the sheep fall by the way. The blacks will eat as many as they can, but even a black cannot stuff himself beyond a certain extent, and there will be plenty for us.\"  \"Yes, I did not think of that,\" Reuben replied; \"in that case two spare horses will be enough.\"  \"It would be a good thing to have a few with us, though,\" one of the young men said. \"My place is only six miles off. I will ride over and bring back three with me; they are all good ones, and I should be sorry to find they were gone when I get back. I can lead one, my black boy can ride another and lead the third. It is likely enough some of the horses may give out, or get speared if the blacks make a fight of it, and half a dozen spare horses would come in very handy.\"  Reuben thought the plan was a good one, whereupon two of the others also volunteered to ride over and fetch--the one three and the other two--horses.  \"That will make ten altogether, with Blount's two. We shall travel all the faster, because we can ride the spare horses by turns.\"  The three settlers rode off at once, and returned late at night with the spare horses. They had not been idle at Mr. Blount's. A bullock had been killed and cut up, and a considerable portion cooked, so that each of the twenty men going on the expedition would start with ten pounds of cooked meat, in order to save the time that would be spent in halting to cook the carcass of any sheep they might come upon. The question of weight was immaterial, as the meat could be packed on the spare horses.  As soon as day broke, the party were in their saddles. Mr. Blount led them first to the hut near which he had found his shepherd killed. The native trackers now took up the search. The body of the other shepherd was found half a mile away. It was in a sitting position by a tree; the skull was completely smashed in by the blow of a waddy, and it was evident that a native had crept up behind him, and killed him before he was conscious that any danger was at hand. The trackers were not long in finding the place where the sheep had been collected together and driven off, and a broad track of trampled grass showed, clearly enough, the direction which had been taken.  \"How many of the black fellows do you think there were?\" Reuben asked one of the trackers.  \"Great many black fellow, captain,\" he replied.  \"What do you call a great many?\" Reuben asked.  \"Twenty, thirty, captain; can't say how many. No use, captain, look for dem, gone right away into de bush, never find them.\"  \"I am going to try, anyhow,\" Reuben said. \"Now, do you lead the way.\"  \"I tink dere are more dan thirty black fellow,\" Jim said to Reuben, as they started; \"quite a crowd of dem. Me no much like those two black fellow,\" and he nodded towards the trackers, who were running on ahead. \"No good, those fellows.\"  \"What makes you think that, Jim?\"  \"Two days ago, Jim saw dem talking wid black fellow, half a mile from the station. Not know Jim saw dem. Secret sort of talk. Why dey never find de tracks before black fellows and bush rangers always get away? Jim tink those fellows no good.\"  Reuben himself had often thought it singular that such continued bad luck should have attended the efforts of his predecessor to hunt down the bush rangers, but the thought that they had been put off their scent by the trackers had not occurred to him. He had the greatest faith in Jim's sagacity and, now that the idea was presented to him, it seemed plausible enough.  \"Very good, Jim, you keep your eye on those fellows. I will do the same. We shall soon find out if they are up to any tricks.\"  Jim had been running by his master's stirrup, while this conversation had been going on; and he now dropped into his usual place at the rear of the party. For some miles the trail was followed at a hand gallop, for the grass was several inches in height, and the trail could be followed as easily as a road. The country then began to change. The ground was poorer and more arid, and clumps of low brush grew here and there. Still, there was no check in the speed. The marks made by the frightened flock were plain enough, even to the horsemen; and bits of wool, left behind on the bushes, afforded an unmistakable testimony to their passage.  \"They were not going so fast, here,\" Mr. Blount said, after dismounting and examining. \"The footprints do not go in pairs, as they did at first. The flock has broken into a trot. Ah! There is the first, ahead.\"  In a hundred yards they came upon the skin and head of a sheep. Nothing else remained. Unable to keep up with the flock, it had been speared, cut up, and eaten raw by the blacks. In the next mile they came upon the remains of two more; then the track widened out, and the footprints were scattered and confused. The horses were reined up, and Jim and the trackers examined the ground. Jim returned in a minute or two.  \"Black fellows give em a rest here. Could no go any furder. Lie down and pant.\"  One of the trackers then came up.  \"They stop here, captain, five six hours till moon rise. Make fire, kill sheep, and have feast.\"  Reuben and some of the settlers rode over to the spot to which the tracker pointed.  \"Confound them!\" Blount exclaimed. \"Look there! There are at least twenty heads.\"  \"So there are,\" Reuben said. \"There must have been a lot of natives.\"  \"Yes, there must have been a good many,\" the settler agreed, \"but not so many, perhaps, as you would think. Nobody has ever found out, yet, how much these blacks can eat when they make up their mind to it; but two could certainly devour a sheep. They will eat till they can't sit upright.\"  \"They would hardly eat as much as that, with a long journey before them,\" Reuben said; \"but allow only three to a sheep, there must be sixty of them. My man said there were a good many more than the trackers put it down at.\"  \"So much the better. I only hope they will show fight.\"  After five minutes halt, the ride was continued for the next three hours. Then three dead sheep were passed. This time the flesh had not been devoured, but the poor beasts had, in every case, been speared.  \"Savage brutes!\" Reuben exclaimed. \"They might at least have given the sheep a chance of life, when they could go no further, instead of wantonly slaughtering them.\"  \"That's their way, always,\" Mr. Blount said. \"They kill from pure mischief and love of slaughter, even when they don't want the meat. But I don't suppose it makes much difference. I expect the sheep have dropped as much from thirst as from fatigue, and they would probably have never been got up again, after they once fell. I fancy we shall come upon a stream, before long. I have never been out as far as this before, but I know that there is a branch of the Nammo crosses the bush here, somewhere.\"  Another five miles, and they came upon the river. The wet season was only just over, and the river was full from bank to bank. It was some thirty yards wide, and from two to three feet deep. A score of sheep lay dead in the water. They had apparently rushed headlong in, to quench their thirst; and had either drunk till they fell, or had been trampled under water, by their companions pressing upon them from behind.  For the next ten miles the track was plain enough, then they came to a series of downs, covered with a short grass. At the foot of these another long halt had been made by the blacks.  \"We must have come twenty-five miles,\" Reuben said.  \"Quite that, captain. The flock must have been dead beat, by the time they got here. I should think they must have stopped here, last night. We will soon see--there is one of their fireplaces.\"  The settler dismounted, and put his hand into the ashes.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"they are warm still. They must have camped here last night. They started when the moon rose, no doubt. Thus they have eight or nine hours' start of us, only; and as they can't travel fast, after such a journey as they had yesterday, we ought to be able to catch them long before night.\"  \"They will go better today than they did yesterday,\" Mr. Blount said. \"They were over-driven to start with, and that was what knocked them up; but the blacks will begin to feel themselves safe today, and will let them go their own pace. Sheep can do twenty miles in a day, if not hurried.\"  \"Well, at any rate,\" Reuben said, \"we will give our horses a couple of hours' rest. It is just eleven o'clock now, and I should think everyone is ready for a meal.\"  There was a chorus of assent. The troop dismounted at once. The girths were loosened, the bits taken from the horses' mouths, and they were turned loose to graze in the long grass at the foot of the hill. There was no fear of their attempting to stray, after their journey of the morning. Some of the men set to to cut brush, and in a few minutes a fire was lighted. One of the sheep, of which there were several lying about, was skinned and cut up; and slices, on skewers of green wood, were soon frizzling over the fire.  Twenty minutes later, the water in a large pot hanging over the fire was boiling. Three or four handfuls of tea were thrown in; and with the fried mutton, cold damper, and tea a hearty meal was made. Then pipes were produced and lighted; while several of the men, lying down and shading their faces with their broad hats, indulged in a doze.  \"One o'clock,\" Reuben said at last, looking at his watch. \"It is time to be moving again.\"  The horses were fetched in, the bridles replaced, and the girths tightened.  \"Now, which way?\" Reuben asked the trackers.  \"Along here, captain, by de foot of de hill, de trail is plain enough.\"  It was so. A track of some width was trampled in the grass.  Reuben was about to give the order to proceed, when he caught Jim's eye, and saw that the black wished to speak to him privately.  \"What is it, Jim?\" he asked, going apart from the rest.  \"That not de way, captain. A hundred, two hundred sheep gone that way, wid four or five black fellow. De rest have all gone over de hill.\"  \"Are you sure, Jim?\"  \"Me quite sure, sar. De ground very hard; but while de captain smoke him pipe, Jim went over de hill, saw plenty sign of sheep. Went straight uphill, and then turned away to de left. Dis little party here hab only gone to frow white man off de trail.\"  \"The trackers ought to have seen that as well as you, Jim,\" Reuben said angrily.  \"Dey see, sar, sure enough. Could no help seeing, wid half an eye. You see, sar, dose fellows up to no good. Lead party wrong if dey can. Don't say, sar, Jim told you. If you say dat, put 'em on their guard. Massa ride along the trail for a bit, just as if talk wid Jim about odder affair; den after little way, begin to talk about trail being too small, den turn and come back here, and go over de hill.\"  \"A very good idea, Jim. I will do as you say.\"    Chapter 11: The Black Fellows.   A few minutes after his conversation with Jim the party started, following the broad track through the grass along the foot of the hill. Reuben informed Mr. Blount of what Jim had told him.  \"By Jove, I think he is right,\" the settler said. \"The track is as broad as it was, but it is nothing like so much trampled down; but if your fellow says the main body have gone over the hill, why are you following this track?\"  Reuben gave his reasons, and said that his man had, before, had suspicions that the trackers were in communication with the wild blacks.  \"He thinks that's why it is that they have so frequently failed, here, to catch any of these fellows.\"  \"I shouldn't be at all surprised,\" Mr. Blount said savagely. \"The best thing would be to put a bullet into each of the rascals' heads.\"  \"I think Jim's idea is best,\" Reuben said. \"Now that we have once got our eyes open, they won't be able to do us any more harm; and my black fellow will see we follow the trail right. I don't want them to see we have any suspicions of them, as that would put them on their guard; and by keeping our eye upon them, we may be able to turn the tables.\"  \"That is so,\" Mr. Blount agreed. \"What are you going to do, then?\"  \"I will call to them, in a minute or two, and tell them that it is your opinion that only a small portion of the flock have come this way. Then we will have a consultation and, no doubt, some of your friends will notice that the ground is not much trampled. Then we will decide to ride back to the point from which we started, and will follow the other trail.\"  \"Yes, that will do very well,\" the settler agreed.  Reuben at once called to the trackers, who were trotting on ahead, and then ordered a halt. The two blacks came back.  \"Joe,\" Reuben said, \"Mr. Blount thinks that the main body of the flock have not come this way. He says he thinks only a hundred or two have come. The ground does not look to me anything like so much trampled as it was before we halted.\"  \"I tink most of dem hab come along here,\" the tracker said sullenly.  \"What do you think?\" Reuben asked the other settlers, who had gathered round.  \"I did not notice it before,\" Dick Caister said; \"but now Blount has pointed it out, I agree with him entirely. There are nothing like the full number of sheep have passed along here. I should say that they have not gone along more than two or three deep.\"  There was a general chorus of assent.  \"You can't have been keeping your eyes open,\" Reuben said to the trackers, sharply. \"If you don't look sharp in future, we shall quarrel.  \"Come, gentlemen, let us ride back to the halting place, and see if we cannot find out which way the main body have gone.\"  Ten minutes' riding took them back to their starting place.  \"They must have gone over the hill,\" Reuben said. \"They certainly have not kept along at the foot, or we should see their tracks in this long grass.\"  The trackers had exchanged a few words in a low tone, and they now moved up the hill, and began to examine the ground carefully.  \"Some of dem have gone this way, captain.\"  \"Of course they have,\" Mr. Blount said. \"A blind man might see that.\"  The marks of the sheep were indeed plain enough to all, when their attention had once been drawn to the subject. On getting beyond the crest the trackers turned to the left, and Reuben saw that they felt it would be hopeless to attempt, further, to mislead a party containing several settlers who were perfectly capable of following the trail.  Jim had, since speaking to his master, remained in the rear of the troop. After three miles' riding across the downs, they again came down upon a flat country, thickly covered with brush. Here and there pieces of wool sticking to thorns were visible, and the trackers went steadily on for some little time. Then their pace became slower, and finally they stopped.  \"Trail ended, captain.\"  \"What do you mean by the trail ended?\" Reuben asked angrily. \"Why, I can see a piece of wool, on there ahead.\"  \"Dat so, captain; but only a few sheep hab passed here.\"  Some of the settlers dismounted and, having examined the ground carefully, declared that they were of the same opinion as the trackers.  \"Very well,\" Reuben said; \"then in that case, we must go back again to the foot of the hill. They were all together there, and we must take up the trail afresh.\"  On reaching the foot of the hill, Jim and some of the settlers joined the trackers, and penetrated the bush in all directions. Each returned bringing in pieces of wool.  \"It is plain enough,\" Reuben said, \"what they have done. They have broken up into small parties, and have scattered. The question is, 'What are we to do now?'  \"What do you think, Mr. Blount? You have had more experience than anyone here, and you are the most interested in our overtaking these rascals. What do you recommend?\"  \"I don't know what to recommend,\" the settler said. \"They have no doubt done it to confuse us, in case we should follow so far, and avoid being thrown off the scent the other side of the hill. The band may really have scattered, and gone off in small parties to different parts of the bush; or again, they may have scattered with the understanding that they will meet again, at some given spot, which may be ten and may be fifty miles ahead.\"  \"The worst of it is,\" Reuben said, \"I fear now that there is an end of all chance of coming up with them, today; and now the question of water comes in. If we could have caught them before nightfall, the horses, having had a good drink at that stream, could have done very well till we'd gone another thirty miles; but as that seems hopeless, now, we must consider seriously what we had best do, before we go any further. Does anyone here know anything of the country ahead?\"  There was a general silence.  \"The horses can do very well, tomorrow, without water,\" Mr. Blount said. \"They will chew the leaves of this scrub; and can, if pressed, hold on for even two or three days upon it.\"  \"In that case,\" Reuben said, \"let us go on. We will break up into three parties. One shall go straight forward, the other two moving to the right and left, each following the tracks as well as they can. We will not go much beyond a walk. We have five more hours of daylight yet, and the horses can manage another fifteen miles. I will halt, an hour before it gets dark, and light a fire. The smoke will be a guide to the other two parties, who should not be more than a couple of miles to the right and left, and they will then close in.  \"If you can suggest any better plan than that, Mr. Blount, please do so. Of course, I see the objection that the blacks may make out the smoke, and will know that they are being followed.\"  \"Yes, that is an objection,\" Mr. Blount said; \"but the chances are that they will know it without your telling them. It is more than probable that some of them have remained behind, on the watch; and that they will have signalled our coming, long ago.\"  \"Dey have done that, sar,\" Jim, who was standing close to Reuben's elbow, put in. \"Jim saw smoke curl up from the top of de hill, just when we turned, when we lost the trail.\"  \"Why didn't you tell me before, Jim?\" Reuben asked.  \"De captain didn't ask Jim any question. Jim thought de captain see it for sure.\"  \"I didn't see it, Jim. I don't think any of us saw it. We were all too much occupied looking for the trail. Another time, you tell me what you see without my asking.  \"Well in that case, Mr. Blount, there can be no harm in my making a smoke, as they know already that they are pursued. Will you take charge of the right hand party? Sergeant O'Connor will take command of the left. Do you each take a tracker with you. I will take my boy. Three constables will go with each of your parties, and four with me.  \"Will you gentlemen please to divide up, so as to make seven altogether in each party, without the natives?\"  \"I need not tell you to keep a sharp lookout, Captain Whitney. We know the blacks are a very strong party and, now they know that they are pursued they may, as likely as not, make a stand.\"  \"Yes, that is quite possible,\" Reuben agreed. \"Will you please be careful that neither of your parties get more than two miles, at the outside, away from mine? We can hear the sound of rifles, at that distance. If either party fires, the others will of course hurry to their assistance. Now, let us move forward.\"  With Jim in advance, Reuben's party moved on, the black carefully examining the ground and bushes as he went; and occasionally, somewhat to Reuben's surprise, rising from the stooping position in which he was walking, and looking back over his shoulder. The motive was explained when Jim exclaimed:  \"Dere, captain, dere are de signals again.\"  Reuben turned in the saddle. On the crest of the hill behind him were three columns of smoke. Scarcely had he looked at them when the smoke ceased to ascend, as if the fires had been suddenly put out.  \"That's to tell them that we have divided in three parties?\" Reuben asked the black.  Jim nodded, and proceeded on his way again.  \"That's awkward,\" Reuben said, \"I must warn the other two parties.\"  So saying, he at once ordered two of the constables to ride right and left and warn the others, who were not as yet more than a quarter of a mile on either hand, that the natives were aware that they had broken up, and that the greatest caution must, therefore, be observed. In ten minutes the two constables returned, having performed their mission.  Although he had no reason to believe that the blacks were within ten miles of him, Reuben now took the precaution of sending one constable out on each flank, to a distance of fifty yards. A third was directed to keep with Jim, fifty yards ahead of the main body; consisting of Reuben himself, a constable, and two colonists. Occasionally Reuben rode forward to question Jim.  \"How many sheep do you think have gone along the track you are following?\"  \"About thirty sheep, and three black fellow.\"  \"How do you know there are three black fellows, Jim? I can see marks, sometimes, of the sheep's feet; but I have not seen a man's footprint at all.\"  \"Jim see 'em, captain, plain enough. When dey all follow sheep, not very plain to see; but sometimes, when de sheep want to scatter, Jim see one footmark on one hand and one on the other, and sure to be one man behind.\"  \"How far are the sheep ahead, Jim, have you any idea?\"  \"Six, eight hours, sar, when dey pass here; but dere's no saying how far they are, now. May be long way on, may be only little way. Me tink dat they hab not gone so berry far; dat smoke berry thin, not see him more than ten miles.\"  \"I wish you had said that before, Jim,\" Reuben said. \"We would have kept together and have galloped on, and taken our chance of finding them.\"  \"Might have found four or five of dem,\" Jim replied, \"but de others all scattered. No good to find dem, till dey come together again.\"  \"No, you are right there, Jim. We must catch them all together, if we can. There are some twelve hundred sheep, somewhere ahead. Mr. Blount said there were about fifteen hundred driven off. We have come upon a hundred dead ones, and two or three hundred may have taken that turn to the right. As you say, it would be no good coming upon thirty.\"  For four hours the party continued their journey.  \"It is six o'clock,\" Reuben said, looking at his watch. \"We will halt, now, and light that fire.\"  Two of the constables were told off to keep watch, some fifty yards in front; and the others dismounted, and gathered together materials for a fire. This was soon done, and the smoke mounted straight and clear, a signal to the other two parties to close in.  Suddenly a cry was heard from one of the sentries. The men stooping round the fire leaped to their feet, just in time to see one of the constables struck from his horse by a boomerang, while a dozen spears whizzed through the air at the other. He fell forward on his horse, which carried him up to the fire; as he fell from the saddle, as it stopped, he was caught by two of the others. Three spears had pierced him.  \"Stand to your arms. Steady, for your lives,\" Reuben shouted.  \"Jim, throw the horses at once, and fasten their legs.  \"We must defend ourselves here,\" he continued, turning to the others, \"until help comes.\"  Not a moment was lost. The little party threw themselves down in a circle, each taking shelter behind a bush; and Jim speedily got the eight horses down in the centre, for each party had with it three of the spare animals. The whole time, from the first alarm until all was ready to receive the natives, did not occupy two minutes.  The horses of the sentries had galloped wildly on, both having been struck by spears; and Jim had no difficulty with the remainder, which were all standing in a group when the alarm was given, the owners not yet having removed their saddles.  All was done without flurry or excitement, although the yells of the natives rose from the bush all round them. The bush was fortunately not very thick at the point where they had halted, Reuben having selected it for that very reason; but the bushes were sufficiently near to each other to enable an enemy to creep up, within thirty yards or so, without being seen.  \"Don't throw away a shot,\" Reuben called out; \"but pick off the blacks, as they stand up to throw their spears.  \"Ah!\"  The exclamation was accompanied by a shot from his rifle, as a native rose suddenly from the bush and hurled his spear. It missed Reuben by an inch or two only; but, as his rifle flashed out, the black threw up his hands and fell back in the bush.  \"Here, sah, dis make good shelter;\" and Jim propped up his saddle, almost in front of him.  \"That's a good idea, Jim; help the others in the same way.\"  [Illustration: A Fight with the Black Fellows.]  The five men were all engaged now. The spears whizzed fast over and among them, but most of them were thrown almost at random; for the blacks soon learned that to raise themselves above the bushes, to take aim, was to court sudden death. Jim, after distributing the saddles to their owners, had lain down by the side of his master; and loaded his rifle as fast as he discharged it, Reuben using his pistols as effectually as the rifle, in the intervals.  Fortunately all the party were provided with these weapons. Had it not been so, each man would have been liable to be rushed by the blacks every time he discharged his rifle. As far as possible they fired by turns; so that each man, while loading, was covered by the fire of those on his right and left.  For half an hour the fight continued. Many of the blacks had fallen, but they continued the assault as vigorously as before, and all the defenders had received more or less serious wounds from the spears.  \"The others ought to have been here, long before this,\" Reuben said, \"if they had followed my instructions. I only hope they have not been attacked, too; but as we don't hear any firing, that can hardly be so.\"  \"I hope they will be up before dusk,\" Dick Caister said. \"It will be dark in another half an hour. These fellows are only waiting for that to make a rush. If they do, it is all up with us.\"  \"They will find it a tough job, even then,\" Reuben said; \"but the others must be here long before that. I told them to keep within two miles of us. They have had time to ride double that distance, since we made the smoke for them.\"  Another ten minutes elapsed.  \"Hurrah!\" Reuben exclaimed, \"I can hear the trampling of horse's hoofs. The moment they arrive, make a rush for your horses and charge.\"  \"I am afraid the horses are killed,\" Dick said ruefully.  \"In that case,\" Reuben said, \"we must get to our feet, and pick off the blacks as they run. They will get up like a covey of partridge, as the horsemen come among them.\"  A loud cheer was heard, and the little party, with an answering shout, sprang to their feet and, rifle to shoulder, stood expecting the blacks to rise; but the ears of the natives were sharper than those of the whites, and they had begun to crawl away before the latter heard the approaching horsemen.  Finding this to be the case, the party ran to their horses. Four exclamations of wrath and grief were heard, for seven of the horses were completely riddled with spears.  Tartar, however, at his master's voice, struggled to rise to his feet. Reuben, aided by Jim, quickly threw off the hobbles; and leaped on to its back as it rose to its feet, just as Mr. Blount, with his party, rode up.  \"Keep close together,\" Reuben exclaimed, as he dashed forward, \"we may find some of the scoundrels.\"  But the chase was in vain. It was already growing dusk, and there was no saying in which direction the natives had crawled away in the bush. After riding for a mile, Reuben reined in his horse.  \"It is no use,\" he said; \"we may as well get back to the fire.  \"What made you so late, Mr. Blount? We were fighting for three quarters of an hour, before you came up.\"  \"I am very sorry,\" Mr. Blount replied; \"somehow or other, we went wrong altogether. There is nothing to guide one in this flat bush, and the tracker who was leading the way said he was certain he was going as you ordered him. Just before six o'clock we halted, and looked in the direction in which we expected to see your smoke, but there were no signs of it. Presently one of the constables exclaimed:  \"'There's the smoke, sir, right behind us.'  \"I looked around and, sure enough, there was a column of smoke, and a long way off it was.  \"'What have you been doing, you rascal?' I said to the black. 'There's the smoke right behind us. You have been leading us wrong, altogether.'  \"The black insisted that he was right, and that the fire must have been made by the black fellows. I didn't know what to make of it. It was two or three minutes past six; and I noticed, when we halted before, that your watch was exactly with mine. So I said to the men:  \"'We will wait five minutes longer and, if we see no other smoke, you may be sure that that is made by Captain Whitney.'  \"We waited the five minutes, and then I gave the word to start, when one of the men exclaimed:  \"'The black fellow's gone.'  \"Sure enough, he had slipped away without being noticed, while we were looking for the smoke. I felt sure, now, that something must be wrong; and we galloped towards your smoke, as fast as the horses could lay their feet to the ground. When we were about half way, we heard the sound of firing, and I can tell you that we didn't lose a moment on the way, after that. Have you had any losses?\"  \"Two of the constables are killed,\" Reuben said, \"and we have all got some more or less ugly scratches. My left arm is useless for a time, I am afraid. A spear went right through it. I fear some of the others have worse hurts.\"  \"What can have become of the sergeant's party?\" Mr. Blount said.  \"They must have gone the wrong way, too,\" Reuben replied. \"I told you I suspected those trackers of being in league with the blacks, and I have no doubt your fellow led you purposely astray, in order to give them an opportunity of cutting us off before you could arrive to our assistance. I suppose the other party has been misled in the same way. It is fortunate, indeed, that you made up your mind to ride for our smoke when you did. A quarter of an hour later, and you would have found only our bodies, and would probably have been ambushed in turn.\"  \"Yes, it has been a close thing, indeed,\" Mr. Blount said. \"I was wrong, after what you told me, to trust that black scoundrel so entirely; but I own it never entered my mind that he was leading us astray.\"  By this time they had reached the fire, which was blazing high.  \"How are you all?\" Reuben asked. \"Nobody badly hurt, I hope?\"  \"Nothing very bad, captain,\" Dick Caister replied cheerfully. \"We have all had our skin ripped up a bit, but nothing very deep. That dodge of the saddles, of your black fellow, saved us. Mine was knocked over half a dozen times by spears, each of which would have done its business, if it hadn't been for it. I owe him my life so completely, that I forgive him for making our horses a barricade, to save yours.\"  Reuben laughed. He had noticed, when he ran for his horse, that Jim had thrown him in the centre of the others: and their bodies completely sheltered him from the spears of the natives.  \"It was not fair, perhaps,\" he said; \"but my horse would have been killed, as well as yours, had he not done so; and Jim loves him almost as well as he does me. He has watched over and guarded him for the last three years.\"  \"I am not angry with him,\" Dick said. \"Nothing could have saved our horses from being killed, and if one was to be saved, it is as well it should be Tartar, and not one of the others, as yours was far the most valuable of the five.\"  \"Pile on the bushes,\" Reuben said to one of the constables. \"Make as big a blaze as you can. It will act as a beacon to the sergeant and his party.\"  Half an hour later the trampling of horses' hoofs was heard and, a few minutes later, the sergeant and his party rode up.  \"I am sorry I am so late, sir,\" the sergeant said. \"Somehow or other we went wrong altogether, and saw nothing of your smoke. I was afraid something was wrong, but did not know what to do; so we halted till it came on dark, and presently made out a fire; but it was miles away, and right in the direction from which we had come. I did not think it could be you but, whether it was you or the blacks, that was the place to ride to.\"  \"Have you got the tracker with you, sergeant?\"  \"Yes, sir; at least, I saw him trotting ahead, ten minutes ago. Why, where has he got to?\"  The tracker was not to be seen.  \"He has made off to join the blacks, I expect,\" Reuben said. \"You have been led astray purposely. We have been attacked, and Brown and Simpson are killed.\"  An exclamation of rage broke from the men, who were in the act of dismounting.  \"I expect,\" Reuben said, turning to Mr. Blount, \"that the fellows noticed the talk I had with Jim, before we turned back from the false trail, and concluded that we had some suspicion that they were in league with the blacks; and so, when the party separated, they determined to lead the two flanking columns astray, so as to give their friends a chance of attacking us, and then to bolt.\"  \"I expect that is it,\" Mr. Blount agreed. \"And now, the first thing is to get something to eat. When that is done, we will have a consultation.\"  While the meat was cooking over the fire, Reuben told off a party of eight men to bury the bodies of the two constables who had fallen. The task was speedily completed, two holes being easily scraped in the light, sandy soil.  After supper was over, the settlers gathered round Reuben.  \"Now, captain, what do you mean to do?\" Mr. Blount asked. \"I have given up all hope of seeing my sheep again, so don't let them influence you, but just do as you think best. The blacks are in strong force, that is evident; and it will be a serious business pursuing them any further, in their own country.\"  \"I am going to pursue them till I catch them,\" Reuben said; \"that is to say, as long as there is a sheep track to serve as a guide. I don't ask you, gentlemen, to go further, for I know it is a serious risk; but it is my duty to hunt those fellows down, and give them a lesson, and I mean to do it. We shall never have safety in the settlements, until those fellows come to understand that, whenever they attack us, they will be hunted down.\"  \"I think you are right,\" Dick Caister said, \"and as long as you go on, I go with you for one, whatever comes of it. But how I am to go without my horse, I don't know.\"  \"There are the spare horses,\" Reuben said; \"Fortunately we have still got six of them.\"  \"So we have,\" Dick exclaimed joyfully. \"I had forgotten all about them. What luck, our bringing them with us!\"  The other settlers all announced their intention of continuing the chase, as long as Reuben was willing to push on.  \"I will tell you what my idea is,\" Reuben said. \"The horses are already worn out and, by the end of another day, they will be half mad with thirst. I propose that we take two days' supply for ourselves, in our water bottles; and that we push forward on foot, sending two of the constables back to the stream, with our horses. I propose that we should push forward tonight. I expect the track we are following is the true one, and the stars will do as a guide.  \"At daybreak we will lie down in the bushes. The blacks will probably leave some fellows behind, as scouts. They, seeing nothing of us, will suppose we have given it up and gone home, and they will make but a short journey. At night we will go on again, and the chances are that, before morning, we shall catch sight of their fires, and will fall upon them at daylight. What do you think of the plan?\"  \"I think it is a good one,\" Mr. Blount said, warmly. \"A capital plan. Of course we don't much like leaving our horses, for in this country one almost lives on horseback. Still, it will be the best plan, certainly; for as you say, the poor brutes will be half mad, by tomorrow night, with thirst.\"  \"It will be a long tramp back again,\" a settler said dismally.  \"We won't tramp all the way,\" Reuben said with a smile. \"Directly we have overtaken the blacks, and given them a lesson, I will send Jim back again for the horses. He can cover the ground at a wonderful pace, and coming back he will ride one of them, and help the two constables to keep them together. They will have had two days' rest, and plenty of food and water, and will meet us before we get halfway back. There will be no fear of the blacks attacking them.\"  All agreed that the plan was excellent, and half an hour later the whole party--with the exception of the two constables, who were to start at daybreak with the horses, for the river--set out on their march. The sky was cloudless, and the stars would have been a sufficient guide, even had they not had Jim with them. The black, however, took his place at the head of the party, and strode along as unhesitating as if it had been broad daylight.    Chapter 12: The Bush Rangers.   Scarce a word was spoken as the little party marched along. It was possible, although very improbable, that the natives, on scattering before the charge of Mr. Blount and his companions, might have left some of their number behind, to watch the movements of their pursuers. They would, however, certainly not anticipate the whites pushing forward that night. The fire had been piled high, the last thing before leaving, and the two men left there were told to keep it burning brightly till morning, and to start before anyone watching in the distance would be able to see whether the horses were mounted, or not. Should any natives approach the fire, after they had gone, they would take it for granted that the whole party had ridden back to the settlement.  All night, Reuben and his companions marched steadily forward; and were glad to throw themselves down on the ground, at the first appearance of daybreak. Four sentries were placed, with strict orders to keep a bright lookout through the bushes, but on no account to raise their heads above their level; and, arrangements having been made for their relief, every two hours, the rest of the party were soon sound asleep.  Except to relieve the sentries, there was no stir among them until late in the afternoon. Then there was a general movement, and soon all were sitting up, and appeasing their appetite upon the cold meat and dampers they had brought with them.  \"There is no harm in a pipe, I suppose, captain?\" Dick Caister said laughingly.  \"No, I think we can risk that,\" Reuben replied. \"The eyes of the savages may be wonderfully keen, but they would be a great deal sharper than I can give them credit for, were they to notice the smoke of a dozen pipes, curling up among the bushes.\"  \"I suppose, Mr. Blount,\" Reuben said as, after the meal was finished, the party lighted their pipes and drew closely round the fire, \"you have heard of a good many bad businesses, with the blacks and bush rangers, in your time?\"  \"I have, indeed,\" Mr. Blount replied. \"In the early days, the settlers had a hard time of it with the blacks; who were, of course, stronger than they are now and, after they had got over their first fear of firearms, more fearless of the whites. The bush rangers too were, when first they began to send convicts here, more numerous than at present. I do not know that they were as desperate as they are now--not so ready to take life, without provocation. You see, there was a very much larger run of country open to them; and many convicts who escaped, and took to the bush, were content to have gained their freedom. Some of them took black gins, and never troubled the colonists again; beyond, perhaps, coming down to a station and carrying off a sheep or two, or a bullock, when they got sick of kangaroo meat and wanted a change.  \"You see, the first settlers were generally poor and hard-working men. Young men with a little capital had not as yet been attracted here, so there was but little inducement for the escaped convicts to meddle with them. There were, of course, some notorious scoundrels, who seemed to murder for the pure love of the thing. The worst of them, I think, was a fellow who went by the name of Cockeye. What his real name was, I never heard.  \"That man was a perfect devil; and was, for a long time, the terror of the settlers. He never worked with other white men, but lived among the blacks. Of course, in those days the police system was in its infancy, and we had to rely upon ourselves. I had a narrow escape, once, of losing my life, from him and his blacks.  \"When I was about seventeen, I lived with my father and mother in a station about fifty miles from Sydney, or as it was called then Port Jackson. It was at that time quite an outlying station. We had two convicts allotted to us, both of them honest fellows enough, who had been transported for poaching or something of that kind--anyhow, they were not old hands, and gave no trouble. My father was a kind master, and we always felt that, in case of need, we could rely upon them just as upon ourselves. In those days it was next to impossible to get hired hands for, as there was plenty of land for anyone to squat upon, comparatively close to the port, the men who came out generally set up for themselves, at once.  \"One day I had been out on horseback, to look for a couple of bullocks which had strayed away; and was on my way back when, ahead of me, I heard the cooey of the blacks. I didn't think much of it, because they were common enough at that time, and a party had made a sort of encampment at a stream, about a mile from the house; but when, a minute later, I heard a gun fired, I guessed that there was mischief.  \"The sound seemed to come from away towards the right, where I knew that one of our men was out, herding the bullocks; so I clapped spurs to my horse, and rode in that direction. When I got near, I saw the cattle running wildly about, and a mob of black fellows among them. I could see no signs of our man, and guessed that he must have gone down; and that I had best ride and warn them, at the house.  \"The blacks saw me, and started at a run in my direction, but I soon left them behind. I was within a quarter of a mile of the house, when a native yell burst out ahead of me, followed by two shots. I rode on and, when I got near the house, saw a lot of black fellows round it.  \"Then came a flash from one of the upper windows, and I saw one of them roll over. That was a satisfaction, for I knew they hadn't caught my father asleep. I knew the doors and shutters were strong, and that he could make a good fight of it. Still, there was only him and my mother at home, for both the men had gone out before I left in the morning; and one man hasn't much chance of holding a house, attacked on all sides. So I made up my mind to try to dash through them, when the shutter opened a little, and my father shouted out:  \"'Ride for help, Bill. I will keep them off, till you get back.'  \"So I turned; but when I had gone a few yards I looked over my shoulder, and I saw a man dash out from behind the house on horseback, and start at a gallop after me. It was a bay with a white leg, and I knew that Cockeye used to ride such a horse, and that there wasn't a better in the colony. Almost at the same moment I heard a shot again, but I didn't look round.  \"I can tell you I felt pretty badly frightened, for there was no mercy to be expected from that scoundrel, and I knew that he was a good deal better mounted than I was. The next station was about four miles off, and I had about two hundred yards start, but before I had gone half a mile, he was within fifty yards of me. I could hear him, cursing and swearing and shouting to me to stop, but I had made up my mind I would not do that.  \"I had got a brace of pistols with me, but I wasn't much of a shot. I had, soon after I started, pulled them out of the holsters and shoved them into my belt in front of me; so that, as he came up, he shouldn't see my hand go down for them. My hope was that he would ride straight up to the side of me, not knowing that I was armed; and that would give me a chance of suddenly letting fly at him.  \"You would think the chance was a poor one; and that he would, to a certainty, shoot me down before he got up. I did not much think he would do that, for I guessed that the scoundrel would do with me as he had in some other cases; namely, take me and carry me back to the house, and there either threaten to shoot me, or hang me up over a fire, or some such devilry, to make those inside give in. I was determined this shouldn't be, and that if I could not shoot him I would be shot myself; for otherwise he would have got my father and mother, and it would have been three lives instead of one.  \"Presently--crack!--came the sound of a pistol, and I heard the bullet whiz close by. I expect that it was only to frighten me into stopping; but in a second or two he fired again, and the shot just grazed my shoulder, so he was in earnest that time.  \"I bent low on my saddle, got a pistol out of my belt, and prepared. There was another shot, the horse gave a spring and I knew he was hit, but for a time he went faster than ever; still, the last shot wasn't from more than twenty yards behind; and I expected, every minute, to see his horse's head coming up beside me. Then I heard a curse and a sudden fall and, looking round, saw his horse was down.  \"Cockeye was on his feet in a moment, and drew another pistol from his holster; so I concluded to keep on as hard as I could go, without waiting to make inquiries. I guessed pretty well what had happened. The shot I had heard my father fire, as he started after me, had hit the horse; and the poor brute had kept on until he dropped. I understood the fellow's firing, now. He felt his horse was failing under him, and his only chance was to stop me.  \"I kept on till I got safe to the station. The three men there started in different directions, to fetch assistance, and by the evening we had a score of men assembled there, and started back to our station. We heard a cooey when we were within a mile of the place, and guessed it was a fellow on the watch. By the time we got there they had all cleared off, but it was a close thing.  \"My mother was a courageous woman, and had defended the back of the house, and my father the front. The blacks had made several attempts to burn the place down; but the roof, like the walls, was made of solid timber; which is the only safe way to build a house, when you are exposed to attacks of the blacks.  \"As long as daylight lasted the old people had done very well, and had kept the blacks at a distance; and we saw, by the marks of blood in the morning, that they must have killed or wounded eight or ten of them; but if we hadn't come up before the blacks had darkness to cover them, it would have gone hard with them. Of course we knew that, and calculated so as to get there before nightfall.\"  \"What became of the bush ranger?\" Reuben asked.  \"Well, curiously enough, that was the last time he ever troubled the settlements. We never knew exactly what became of him, but it was said that the blacks killed and eat him. I know that was very often the end of those fellows. As long as all went on well, the blacks were friendly enough with them, and were glad to follow their lead; but after a repulse like that they got at our station, or perhaps as a result of some quarrel about the division of the plunder, or their gins, or something of that sort, they would fall suddenly on their white friends, and make cooked meat of them.\"  \"I suppose the blacks seldom spare any whites who fall into their hands?\" Reuben asked.  \"Scarcely ever,\" Mr. Blount replied. \"That was why they were more dreaded than the bush rangers. The latter would kill, if they were in the humour for it; but if there was no serious resistance, and none of their number got hurt, more often than not they contented themselves by leaving everyone tied, hand and foot, till somebody came to unloose them.  \"I remember one horrible case, in which they so tied up three white men at a lonely station, and nobody happened to go near it for three weeks afterwards. It struck someone that none of them had been seen, for some time; and a couple of men rode over and, to their horror, found the three men dead of hunger and thirst.  \"Now the black fellows don't do that sort of thing. When they do attack a station and take it, they kill every soul; man, woman, and child.\"  \"I suppose, in that affair you were telling us of,\" Reuben asked, \"both of your ticket-of-leave men were killed?\"  \"Yes. One seemed to have been surprised and speared at once. The other had made a stout fight of it, for the bodies of three natives were found near him.\"  \"I remember one case,\" one of the others said, \"in which the blacks did spare one of the party, in a station which they attacked. It was a little girl of about three years old. Why they did so I don't know; perhaps the chief took a fancy to her. Maybe he had lost a child of the same age, and thought his gin would take to the little one. Anyhow, he carried her off.  \"The father happened to be away at the time. He had gone down to Sydney with a waggon, for stores; and when he got back he found the house burned, and the bodies of his wife, two boys, and two men, but there was no trace of that of the child.  \"He was nearly out of his mind, poor fellow. The neighbours all thought that the body must have been burned with the house; but he would have it that there would have been some sign of her. No one else thought so; and besides, it wasn't the custom of the blacks to carry off anyone. The father got a party to try and follow the blacks, but of course it was no use. They had pretty near two days' start.  \"The father never took to his farm again, but hung about the out stations, doing a job here and there for his grub. Sometimes he would be away for a bit, and when he came back, though he never talked about it, everyone knew he had been out hunting the blacks.  \"I do not know how many of them he killed, but I know he never spared one, when he got him outside the settlement. After a time the blacks never troubled that part. So many of them had been killed that they got a superstitious fear of the man, and believed he was possessed of an evil spirit; and I don't believe twenty of them, together, would have dared to attack him.  \"At last, from some of the half-tamed blacks in the settlement, he got to hear some sort of rumour that there was a white girl, living with one of the tribes far out in their country, and he set out. He was away four months, and he never said what he had been doing all the time. In fact, he started almost directly for the port, and went home by the next ship.  \"However, he brought his child back with him. It was four years since she had been carried off, and she was a regular little savage, when she arrived in the settlement with him. Of course she could not speak a word of English, and was as fierce as a little wildcat. I expect she got all right, after a bit.  \"I didn't see the man, but I heard he was worn to a shadow, when he got back. He must have had an awful time of it, in the bush. What with hunger and thirst, and dodging the blacks, I don't know how he lived through it; but he looked contented and happy, in spite of his starvation, and they say it was wonderful to see how patient he was with the child.  \"They got up a subscription, at Sydney, to send them both home. I heard that the captain of the ship he went in said, when he came back the next voyage, that the child had taken to him, and had got civilized and like other children before they got to England.\"  \"Of course, such fellows as Cockeye and Fothergill are the exceptions, and not the rule,\" Mr. Blount said. \"Were there many of such scoundrels about, we should have to abandon our settlements and make war upon them; for there would be no living in the colony till they were exterminated. Most of these fellows are the colonial version of the highwaymen, at home. It is just 'Stand and deliver.' They content themselves with taking what they can find in a traveller's pockets, or can obtain by a flying visit to his station.\"  \"Yes, I had several of those in my last district,\" Reuben said. \"They were just mounted robbers, and gave us a good deal of trouble in hunting them down. But none of them had shed blood during their career, and they did not even draw a pistol when we captured them. That style of bush ranger is a nuisance, but no more. Men seldom carry much money about with them here, and no great harm was done.\"  \"You see,\" Dick Caister said, \"these fellows have a remarkable objection to putting their necks in the way of a noose; so that although they may lug out a pistol and shout 'Bail up!' they will very seldom draw a trigger, if you show fight. So long as they do not take life they know that, if they are caught, all they have to expect is to be kept at hard work during the rest of their sentence, and perhaps for a bit longer. They don't mind the risk of that. They have had their outing, sometimes a long one; but if they once take life, they know its hanging when they are caught; and are therefore careful not to press too hard upon their triggers.  \"But once they have killed a man, they don't generally care how many more lives they take. They are desperate, then, and seem to exult in devilry of all kinds. As to being stuck up by an ordinary bush ranger, one would think no more of it than of having one's pockets picked, in England.  \"It's lucky for us, on the whole, that the black fellows have such a hatred of the white men. Were it not for that, a good many of these fellows would go all lengths, relying on taking to the bush when they had made the colony too hot to hold them. But there are only a few of them that have ever got on well with the blacks, and many a man who has gone out into the bush has found his end there. You see, there's no explaining to a dozen natives, who jump up and begin to throw spears and boomerangs at you, that you are a bad white fellow, and not a colonist on the search for fresh runs.  \"No, the bush rangers on the whole are not such a bad lot of fellows. I suppose there is not one of us, here, who hasn't had men ride up and ask for food; who were, he knew pretty well, bush rangers. Of course they got their food, as anyone else would who rode up to a station and asked for it.  \"Once, only, I was told to hand over any money I had in the house. As, fortunately, I had only a few pounds I gave it up without making a fight for it. It's no use risking one's life, unless for something worth fighting for. I suppose most of us here have had similar experiences.\"  There was a general chorus of assent among the settlers.  \"Many of them are poor-spirited wretches. Two of them bailed up a waggoner of mine, coming out with a load from the port. He pretended to give in and, as they were opening some of the boxes, he knocked one over with the butt end of his whip. The other fired a hasty shot, and then jumped on to his horse and galloped off again; and my man brought in the fellow he had stunned.\"  \"Did you hand him over to the police?\" Reuben asked.  \"Not I,\" the settler laughed. \"I thought he had got what he deserved, so I bandaged up his head and let him go. Those poor beggars of convicts have a dreadful hard time of it, and I don't think there are many settlers who would hand over any man who had escaped, and taken to the bush, even if he had occasionally bailed up a waggoner or so. We know what a flogging the poor wretch would get and, as long as it's only an occasional robbery, to keep themselves from starving, we don't feel any great animosity against them. It's different, altogether, when they take to murder. Then, of course, they must be hunted down like wild beasts.  \"And now I vote that we have a nap. My pipe's out, and I suppose we shall be on the tramp again, as soon as it is dark.\"    Chapter 13: Bush Rangers.   As soon as it became dark, the journey was renewed.  \"Now, Jim, you must keep your eyes well open,\" Reuben said. \"There is no saying when we may come upon them, now.\"  \"I tink dey not berry far off, sah. Dose sheep too tired to go far. Black fellow glad to stop and rest, when he see no one coming after him.  \"De ground more up and down here. Must no make noise. May come upon dem sudden.\"  It was nearly midnight when Jim suddenly halted.  \"What is it, Jim?\" Reuben asked, in a low voice.  Jim stood sniffing the air.  \"Me smell fire, captain.\"  Reuben sniffed the air, but shook his head.  \"I don't smell anything, Jim.\"  \"I smell him, sah, sure enough; not very close, perhaps, but in de air.\"  \"What is it, Captain Whitney?\" Mr. Blount asked, as he came forward and joined them.  \"Jim says he smells fire, but I can't smell it.\"  \"Oh, you can trust Jim's nose,\" the settler said. \"It is wonderful how keen is the scent of these natives. They are like dogs in that respect; and can perceive the smell of a fire, when the wind brings it down to them, miles away.\"  \"Dis way now, sah,\" Jim said, turning off to the left, at right angles to the course which they had been pursuing. \"Smell come down the wind, dat's sartin. We follow him far enough, we sure to catch dem.\"  For fully two miles, Reuben followed the black without speaking. Then he said:  \"I don't smell any smoke, Jim. Are you quite sure you are right about it?\"  \"Quite sure, sah. De smoke much stronger than he was. Some of dese bushes make very sharp smell; can smell him very far away.\"  \"That's all right, Jim, on we go then. I must take your word for it.\"  After another half-an-hour's walking, Reuben thought that he too could smell an odour of burning wood and, soon afterwards, he became convinced that it was so. The ground on which they were crossing was slightly undulated and, on nearing the crest of one of the slight rises, Jim said:  \"De smoke am getting strong now, sah; and Jim can hear de bleating of de sheep. If de captain will wait here, Jim will go on ahead, and find out where dey lie.\"  \"But perhaps you won't be able to find us again.\"  \"Der no fear of dat, sah. But if I not come straight back, I give a little whistle-like this--when I get on to a rise; and if the captain answer in just the same way, then I come straight back to him.\"  So saying, Jim glided away in the darkness; while Reuben gave the word for the men to halt, and lie down till his return. There was, however, no occasion for a signal for, in little over half an hour from the time of Jim's leaving, he rejoined them again; his coming being unnoticed until he stood among them, so noiseless were his footsteps.  \"We hab dem dis time, sure enough, captain.\"  \"Why, is that you, Jim? You quite startled me. Well, what is your news?\"  \"De black fellows and de sheep are a little over a mile away, sah. Dey got a big fire down in a bottom. Some of dem eating still, but most of dem fast asleep round de fire.\"  \"How many are there of them?\"  \"About fifty, sah--at least, dat about the number Jim saw. I expect I was right when I tell you dat there was well nigh a hundred, at fust. Some ob them go off wid de sheep, de odder way, and we kill over twenty in dat fight.\"  \"Do you think we killed so many as that, Jim?\"  \"I went round, sah, and counted sixteen of dem; and some sure to have crawl away and die in de bush. Dere were over twenty killed altogether, for sure; and I specks dat some more hab left de party today, and gone off wid dere share of de sheep to der people.\"  \"Well, what do you think, Mr. Blount--shall we attack them tonight, or wait till morning?\"  \"I should say wait till morning, certainly,\" the settler said. \"We might shoot a few if we attack them now, but the rest would be all off, at the first flash of our gun; and we should never get another shot. I think our best plan would be to remain where we are, for another couple of hours--it is two o'clock now--then Jim will guide us to the place, and we can take up our position as close as we can get, and wait for daylight.\"  \"There is no fear of their making a move before it is light, Jim?\"  \"No, sah. Dey tink dey am safe now, and eat one big feast. Dey not move till light, sartain.\"  \"Very well, Mr. Blount, then we will do as you say. When we get near them we will divide into four parties. You, with four men, shall move up close to the sheep, Sergeant O'Connor, with four others, shall work up from the other end of the bottom. Five others shall make a detour, and get right on the other side of their fire; and I, with the other three and Jim, who you see has got one of the constables' rifles and ammunition, will come down on them from this side.  \"Jim will place all the parties, taking them by turns, as near the fire as he thinks safe; and will then return to me. Only, as we shall attack them from four sides, let everyone be careful about his shooting; otherwise we shall have casualties from our own shots.  \"All will remain quiet until I fire. Then a general volley must be poured in, with bullet and buckshot; and when the rifles and guns are empty, go right at them with pistol and sword.\"  The plan was carried out as arranged and, before daybreak, the four parties were lying in the positions allotted to them, within forty yards of the blacks. A few of these were seen sitting by the fire, the rest were all asleep.  Gradually the light began to creep over the sky and, as it became lighter, there was a movement among the blacks. As soon as he could see perfectly, Reuben was about to fire in the air; for he did not like to fire at unsuspecting men, in spite of the deeds of blood and rapine they had performed in the settlement.  Presently, however, his eye fell upon one of the treacherous trackers, who had so nearly brought destruction upon them. He levelled his rifle and fired, and the man fell dead in his tracks.  As the rest of the blacks leapt to their feet, a volley from nineteen guns was poured into them--followed by seven or eight more, as most of the settlers were armed with double-barrelled guns; a few buckshot being dropped into each barrel, over the bullets. Then came the sharp cracks of the pistols, as the whites rushed down to the assault.  The natives attempted no resistance. Panic stricken at the sudden appearance of the foe, whom they imagined by this time far back on their way to the settlements; and paralysed by the slaughter made by the first volley, they thought only of flight. A few caught up their spears and waddies, as they made a dash for the bushes, and strove to effect their escape between the parties advancing on each side of them; but the latter were now close at hand and, for a minute or two, a fight took place between the whites, with their clubbed muskets, and the natives with their spears and waddies. But it was soon over, for the natives only fought to escape and, as soon as they saw an opening, bounded away into the bushes.  Only one of the assailants was killed, but several were more or less severely wounded by the spears; while no less than thirty-four of the blacks were killed. The victors made no attempt at pursuit but, as soon as the last of the natives had escaped, they gathered to ascertain what loss had taken place, on their side.  \"Poor Phillips is killed,\" Mr. Blount said, as he examined the body. \"The spear has gone right through his throat. Fortunately he was a single man. He has only been out here a few months, and was staying down at Dick Caister's.\"  \"Poor Tom,\" Dick said, in feeling tones. \"He was a capital young fellow, and I am deeply sorry. Fortunately he has left no one behind to grieve more than I do for him, for he lost his father and mother shortly before he came out, and was alone in the world.\"  \"I am thankful it's no worse,\" Mr. Blount said. \"We have given the blacks a terrible lesson. I think, as far as they are concerned, we can sleep in peace for a long time. Of course we have not done with them, for they are very revengeful; but a blow like this will render them careful, for a long time, how they attack us.  \"How many of them have fallen?\"  \"Thirty-four,\" Reuben said. \"Jim has just been counting them up.  \"Now, Mr. Blount, we will have another of your sheep for breakfast, and then we'll be off.\"  The sheep had scattered somewhat, at the alarm of the fire, but were soon driven together again. One was caught and killed, and slices of the meat were stuck up on ramrods, and were soon frizzling before the fire.  \"Well, Mr. Blount, how many sheep do you think there are here?\"  \"I have just been looking them over,\" the settler replied, \"and I should say there must be nearly twelve hundred; so that, allowing for two hundred driven off in the other direction, and a hundred dropped by the way, the whole flock are accounted for. I am indeed obliged to you, and to my friends here. I never expected to see a tail of them again, when I found they were off.\"  \"I am very glad you have recovered so many of them,\" Reuben said, \"and still more, that we have given the blacks such a lesson. We will, as soon as we have finished, be on the march. Jim will go on ahead at once, as we agreed; and he tells me will get to the stream where the horses are before night, and will start out with them at once, so that we may be able to meet them tomorrow, early. I fancy our water bottles are all getting very low, but we can hold on for today.\"  As soon as he had finished eating, Jim started off at a run, which Reuben knew he would keep up for hours. The body of young Phillips was buried; and then, collecting the flock and driving it before them, the rest started upon their return. The sheep could not travel fast, for many of them were footsore with their hurried journey; but they had found plenty of nourishment in the grass at the bottoms, and in the foliage of the bushes and, being so supplied, had suffered little from thirst.  Jim, before starting, had pointed out the exact line they were to follow, and this they kept by compass. With only one or two short halts, they kept on until nightfall and, leaving the sheep in a grassy bottom, lit their fire on the crest above it, in order that its flame might serve as a guide to Jim, should he get back with the horses before daylight.  There was but little talking, before each stretched himself at length before the fire. They had been twenty-four hours without sleep, and all were now suffering severely from thirst. The last drops in the water bottles had been emptied, early in the day; and they were parched not only by the heat of the sun, but by the stifling dust raised by the flock as they travelled.  There had been but little supper eaten. Indeed, most of them contented themselves with chewing pieces of raw meat, to satisfy their thirst rather than their hunger. Although they had no fear of the return of the natives, Reuben thought it only prudent to keep watch, and each of the party had half an hour on sentry duty.  The day was just beginning to break, when the man on guard exclaimed:  \"I can hear the trampling of horses!\"  The news brought everyone to their feet, and in a few minutes the two constables and Jim rode up, driving before them the horses of the rest of the party.  \"Well done, Jim!\" Reuben exclaimed. \"Now, the first thing, get one of the water skins off.\"  One of the skins was unfastened in a minute and, after copious draughts, everyone felt refreshed and ready for work again.  \"We cannot start for a few hours,\" Reuben said. \"The horses must have come over forty miles, and won't be fit to travel till the afternoon; fortunately there is plenty of grass for them in the bottom. And now that my thirst is allayed, I begin to discover that I am hungry.\"  There was a general chorus of assent. The fire was made up again. The men went down to the bottom, and killed and brought up a sheep; and all were soon engaged in making up for their twenty-four hours' fast.  In the afternoon a start was made; but although they travelled all night, they did not reach the stream until the following afternoon, as they were obliged to accommodate their pace to that of the sheep. The following morning Reuben rode forward to the settlements, leaving Mr. Blount, with two of his friends, to come on with the flock at his leisure.  At the first farm he reached Reuben heard that, as he feared, the bush rangers had taken advantage of so many of the settlers being away to recommence their attacks. At the first two houses they visited, they had found the inmates on the watch, and had moved off without making any attack. At the third they had surprised and killed a settler, his wife, and two hired men, and had sacked and burned the house. Reuben learned that some of the police had gone off in pursuit.  Leaving his horse to the care of the settler, Reuben borrowed a fresh animal and rode off to the scene of the outrage, which was some thirty miles distant. Just as he arrived there he met the party of eight police, who had been in pursuit of the bush rangers, and they reported that they had lost all trace of them.  For the next two or three weeks Reuben did not return to his headquarters, spending the time in riding from station to station, with a small party of police, and urging upon the settlers the necessity not only of strongly barricading their houses, but of keeping a watch by turns; as the bush rangers seldom attack a place, unless they can gain the advantage of a surprise.  As nothing had been heard of the bush rangers, Reuben determined to return to his barrack. He was spending the last night at Dick Caister's when, just as they were about to turn in, the sound of a horse's hoofs, at full gallop, was heard.  \"Something is the matter,\" Dick said. \"Men don't ride like that, at night, for nothing.\"  He went to the door and opened it, just as the horseman stopped in front.  \"Quick, Caister!\" the man said as he leaped down, \"the bush rangers are not fifty yards behind.\"  And indeed, the sound of the trampling of other horses sounded close behind.  \"Come in, come in!\" Dick cried. \"Ah! Is it you, Shillito? Never mind the horse, he must look after himself. Luckily the captain's here, and we will give it them hot. Just run round and see that all the shutters are fastened.\"  As Dick spoke he was barring the door, and he now shouted at the top of his voice to the two hired men, who were in bed upstairs; but before any answer could be returned, there was a thundering knocking at the door.  \"What is it?\" Dick shouted.  \"Open the door, and be quick about it, or it will be worse for you. We want that chap that's just ridden up, and we mean to have him, so he had best come out at once. If you don't open the door at once, we will cut the throats of every soul in the house.\"  \"You have got to get at our throats first, my fine fellow,\" Dick said jeeringly.  The knocking was at once renewed, but with greater violence.  \"The door's a strong one,\" Dick said to Reuben, \"and it will stand a good deal of that sort of thing; but we may as well move the table and benches up against it, then we can see how things stand.\"  Reuben had been busy taking down the guns, which hung over the fireplace; dropping a ramrod into them to see that they were charged, and putting fresh caps on to the nipples. His own rifle stood in the corner; and was, he knew, ready for service.  \"What arms have you altogether, Caister?\"  \"I have that rifle and double-barrel gun. Both my hands have got muskets; I got them up from Sydney, a few months back.\"  The two men now came running down from above, each with his musket.  \"Where is Jim?\" Reuben said, looking round.  \"He went out about ten minutes ago,\" Dick said. \"I fancy he went to look after your horse. He takes as much care of that animal as if it were a child.\"  \"I hope they won't find him in the stable, and cut his throat,\" Reuben said. \"He is wonderfully faithful and attached to me. I would not have harm come to him, for anything.  \"Now, I will go upstairs and reconnoitre. Now those fellows have left off knocking at the door, they are a good deal more dangerous than when they were kicking up all the row.\"  \"Mind how you show yourself, captain, as likely enough one of them is on the watch, expecting that we should be sure, sooner or later, to take a look out of that window. So keep well back. The night is pretty light, so I expect you will be able to make them out.\"  \"Can we get a view of the stable from that window?\"  \"Yes,\" Dick replied, \"I rather had that in my mind's eye, when I put the stable up. It's always a good thing, men knowing that their master can have an eye upon them, when they least expect it. Why do you ask?\"  \"Because if the window commands the stable door, we can prevent them getting the horses out.\"  \"Yes,\" Dick said, \"after losing two in that last affair, it would be a serious matter to have the rest of them carried off.\"  Reuben went up the stairs and made his way towards the window, standing a short distance back. He could see no one moving about in the yard, and he was about to move close to it, when a tremendous crash took place below, followed by loud shouts. He ran downstairs again.  The bush rangers had moved round to the back of the house and, there picking up a young tree which had been brought in, to saw up into billets for firewood, they used it as a battering ram against one of the shutters; and at the very first blow broke it off its hinges, and then made a rush at the window. Two shots rang out almost together; and then, firing a hasty volley into the window, the bush rangers began to climb in. But by this time Reuben had arrived, and the sharp cracks of his pistols rang out.  \"They have got the police here!\" one of the men exclaimed, as he caught a sight of Reuben's uniform.  \"Draw off, lads, I expect it's that accursed captain,\" another voice exclaimed. \"He's always riding about, with nobody but that black fellow with him. He has got to go down, that fellow has, or he will give us no end of trouble; but draw off from that window, for a moment.\"  \"What will they do next, I wonder?\" Dick Caister said as, leaving the two hands to guard the window, he returned into the other room with Reuben.  \"I rather expect they are going to try to burn us out. We must keep them from that, if we can.  \"Mr. Shillito, will you go up to the upper room, and keep an eye on the stables? Shoot down anyone who may pass your line of sight.  \"Haven't you got any loopholes, Caister?\"  \"Yes, of course I have,\" Dick replied. \"I had forgotten all about them. Yes, there are two loopholes in the logs in each side of the house, upstairs. They have been shut up by wisps of straw, ever since the house was built.\"  Giving strict orders, to the two men, to shout instantly if anyone moved near the window, the two young men went upstairs.  \"Have you seen anything, Shillito?\"  \"Not a thing. One would almost think that they have bolted.\"  \"They will hardly do that, I fancy,\" Reuben said. \"There are ten or twelve of them, but I think one or two must have got a bullet in them.\"  \"I wish they would come on,\" Dick said, as he pulled out the straw from the loopholes.  Reuben went to them all in succession, and looked out, but nothing could be seen of their assailants. Presently, however, a number of dark figures appeared, each bearing a burden.  \"They have been cutting brush wood!\" Reuben exclaimed. \"I was right, you see. They are going to try to smoke or burn us out. Now I think it's time to give them a lesson.\"  \"Look, look!\"  The exclamation was excited by a sudden glare of light, on the other side of the stables.  \"The scoundrels have set fire to the stables!\" Shillito said.  \"What shall we do--make a sally?\" Caister asked. \"I am ready for it, if you think right.\"  \"No,\" Reuben said, \"they would only shoot us down as we come out. They must guess that some of us are up at this window, or they would try to carry the horses off, instead of destroying them.  \"I only wish we were on the poor beasts' backs. We would go for them, though they were twice as many.  \"I don't see the others now--they must have gone round to the other side of the house.\"  Scarcely had Reuben taken up his station, at one of the loopholes behind, than he again saw the dark figures. He took steady aim and fired. There was a sharp cry, and one of the fellows fell to the ground. The others at once threw down their burdens, and fled. Three minutes later there was a shout.  \"Look here, you policeman, and you, Caister, you shall pay dearly for this night's work. I swear it, and Bill Fothergill never forgets his word in that way. It's your turn, this time. It will be mine the next, and when it is, take care.\"  The only reply was a shot from Reuben, aimed in the direction from which the voice came. A minute later there was a trampling of horses.  \"They are gone!\" Shillito exclaimed.  \"Perhaps it is only a trick, to draw us out,\" Dick suggested.  \"No, I don't think it's that,\" Reuben said. \"They are not strong enough to send a party off, and to attack us with the rest. No, I think they have gone. They know that we can't follow them.  \"They have taken good care of that,\" he added bitterly, as he glanced at the stables, which were now a sheet of flame. \"However, we will look round and see.\"  The three men descended to the room below and, being joined by the two hands, removed the furniture piled against the door, and threw it open.  \"We mustn't go round to that side of the house, so as to get into the glare of the fire, till we have looked round,\" Reuben said. \"I believe they are all gone; but they may have left a couple of them lurking, somewhere about, to pick us off when we show in the light.  \"I will take one of your hands, Caister, and scout round on one side. Do you three go the other side.\"  A quarter of an hour later the two parties met near the stables, where the fire was now burning low. The roof had fallen in, and only some of the uprights were erect, with flicking flames licking them as they stood glowing above the mass of still blazing debris.  \"I wonder whether that poor fellow is under that?\" Reuben said.  \"I hope not, indeed. I fancy he must have got away. He might have slipped off when they first rode up. He may be hiding somewhere round, afraid to come near till he knows how matters have turned out.\"  So saying, he gave a loud cooey. They stood silent for a minute, but no answer came back.  \"There is nothing to be done, till morning,\" Dick said, \"and it's no use hanging about here. Before it gets light I will start for Watson's. There are two of your men there; and they, with the two Watsons and ourselves, can set out after these fellows, if you are agreeable. That is, as soon as we get hold of some horses.\"  \"I hardly think I shall be justified in taking you,\" Reuben said, as he walked back towards the house. \"These scoundrels are all armed to the teeth, and they are first-rate shots. They know every foot of the country, and against anything like equal numbers they would make a desperate fight of it, even if they did not thrash us. Of course, in anything like an equal number of my own men I should not hesitate, but I don't think it will be fair for you settlers to undertake such a service as that.\"  \"Listen!\" Shillito exclaimed, \"they are coming back again.\"  Surely enough, on the night air the sound of horses, galloping at full speed, could be heard.  \"I don't think it can be them,\" Reuben said. \"They would have no motive in coming back, after they once rode off. They would know we should be ready for them.\"  \"I don't see who else it can be. At any rate, all our guns are loaded; and if it is them, all the better.\"  Suddenly a loud cooey was heard.  \"That's Jim!\" Reuben exclaimed. \"I should know his call among a thousand. He must have made off to get help at once, but I don't know how he can have done it in time.\"  \"Why, it's the Watsons and my men!\" he exclaimed, as the party rode up into the light.  \"All safe?\" one of the settlers cried, as he jumped from his horse.  \"All safe, thank God,\" Reuben replied. \"Did Jim bring you news that we were attacked?\"  \"Yes; fortunately we were sitting up late, talking, when he rode up; so there was not a minute lost.\"  \"Rode up!\" Reuben repeated, in surprise; \"why, where did you get a horse, Jim?\"  \"Rode master's horse,\" Jim said.  \"What!\" Reuben exclaimed in delight, \"what, is Tartar safe? I was afraid his body was under those ruins. Why, how did you get him out?\"  \"Jim was in de stable, sah, when bush ranger ride up. De horses was stamping, and I not hear dem till dey come quite close, den it was too late to run out.  \"De moment dat dey began to make bobbery at door, I opened stable door and bring out de three horses.\"  \"What! Did you get mine out, too?\" Dick shouted. \"Jim, you are a trump, and no mistake.\"  \"Den,\" Jim went on, paying no attention to the interruption, \"me led de other two hosses little way, and let them go loose, sure not go far from home; and I jump on Tartar, and ride like de debel to Watson's for de police.\"  \"Well done, Jim. You have done capitally. Now let us talk over what we had better do.\"  The party re-entered the house. Fresh wood was thrown on to the fire, and one of Dick's hands proceeded to put food on the table, and prepare tea, while the others consulted what course should be pursued.  It was agreed, at once, that more aid would be necessary, before they could think of attacking the bush rangers; but all were ready to join in the hunt for them. Therefore it was decided that Dick Shillito and the two Watsons should each ride, at once, to neighbouring stations to bring aid. At one of the stations two more policemen would be found, and as in the pursuit they should probably pass near other stations, their numbers would swell as they went. When this was settled, the party sat down to the meal.  \"How did you come upon them, Shillito?\" Caister asked.  \"I had been spending the day with the Wilkinsons. I did not start to ride home till it was rather late, and I was riding fast when, about a quarter of a mile before I got to my place, I rode right into the middle of a lot of men on horseback. They evidently hadn't heard me coming, and were as much surprised as I was.  \"There was a general shout of 'Bail up!' and I saw at once what sort of gentry they were. However, I didn't stop, but in the confusion dashed through.  \"A few shots were fired at me. I suppose they were too surprised to aim straight. Then they started off after me. I knew it was no use making for home, for there was only one man there; so I swept round and made for your place. My horse is a good one, you know, and I gained on them all except one man, who must have been capitally mounted, for he gradually crept up to me. He wasn't twenty yards behind me when he shouted:  \"'Stop, or I fire!'  \"I pulled straight up and, as he came up to me, let fly at him. He tumbled off his horse, and I galloped off till I got here.\"  \"What has become of your horse, I wonder?\"  \"I gave him a cut with my whip, as I jumped off. He cantered away. Of course they may have caught him, but I don't think it's likely.\"  \"You will find him somewhere about at daylight, I expect. I will ride Caister's spare horse, now.\"  For Jim, with one of the hands, had gone out to fetch in the two horses from the spot where they had been turned loose.    Chapter 14: An Unexpected Meeting.   As soon as it was light the party were assembled and started, Jim leading the way, at a swinging pace which kept the horses going at a hand canter. The marks were, for a time, perfectly easy to follow. Five miles on the tracks led to a shepherd's hut. At their call, the man came out.  \"You had a visit from bush rangers last night?\"  \"What if I did?\" the man replied gruffly. \"I can't help where the bush rangers pay their visits. Yes, they came in here and said they wanted some supper; and you may guess I did not keep them waiting long, for they were not in a particularly good temper. From what they said, three of their men had been killed.\"  This was already known to the party, as Jim had found three bodies at a short distance from the house. Two of these had evidently been carried there from the back window, where they had been killed in trying to effect the entry. The other had been shot when approaching to fire the house.  \"The captain of the gang was terrible put out, and was a-cussing and swearing as to what he would do to those as did it. I wouldn't be in their shoes, if they were to fall into his hands.\"  \"They didn't say anything which would give you an idea as to the direction they were taking?\"  \"Not they,\" the man replied. \"You don't suppose they would be such fools as that and, if they had, you don't suppose as I should be such a fool to split on 'em. Not likely. I ain't no desire to wake up, one night, and find the door fastened outside and the thatch on fire.\"  \"We may as well ride on,\" Reuben said. \"We shall learn nothing here. The fellow is a ticket-of-leave man, and as likely as not in league with these scoundrels.  \"I wonder what they came here for,\" he added, as they started again.  \"I tell you, sah,\" Jim said. \"Dat fellow has driven his herd ober their trail--all stamped out--no saying where they hab gone to.\"  \"We must follow the herd, then,\" Reuben said. \"If we look sharp, we ought to be able to see the traces where they left them.\"  Jim shook his head.  \"No find,\" he said decidedly. \"Plenty places where de ground am berry hard, and horse feet no show. Dey choose some place like dat and turn off; perhaps put rug under horses' feet, so as to make no mark. Me sarch, sah. Jim look him eyes very hard, but tink no find.\"  And so, to their great disappointment, it turned out. They followed the tracks of the herd three miles, until they came upon them, quietly grazing; but nowhere could they see any trace of a party of horsemen turning off. All the party were greatly vexed at the ill success of their expedition; for all had hoped that they were, at last, going to overtake the gang who had done such mischief in the colony.  Reuben was especially disgusted. He had, only the day before, received a letter from his chief acknowledging the receipt of his report describing the pursuit of the blacks, and congratulating him warmly upon his success. The letter ended:  \"If you can but give as good an account of the bush rangers, we shall be indeed grateful to you. As it is, you have more than justified my selection of you for the post.\"  Leaving two constables as guards, at Dick Caister's station, in case, as was probable enough, the bush rangers should return to take revenge for the repulse they had experienced there, Reuben rode back to his headquarters, from which he had now been absent some time. The evening after his return, he called Jim into his room.  \"Jim,\" he said, \"I want your advice as to the best way of finding out where these bush rangers are quartered. How do you think we had better set about it? Would it be of any use, do you think, for you to go among the natives and try and find out? There is no doubt they know, for they have often acted with the bush rangers. Do you think you could pass among them?\"  \"No, sah,\" Jim said at once. \"Me no speak deir way. Me understand black fellow, me talk dar language, but not same way. They find out difference directly and kill me. De wild black fellows hate those who hab lived wid de white men. We hate dem just de same way. We say dem bad black fellow, dey say we no good.\"  \"But those rascally trackers who led us wrong, that day of the fight, they were friendly with them.\"  \"Yes, sah, but dey not so very long away from the bush, and always keep friends wid the others. Meet dem and talk to dem, and tell dem dey set the white men on wrong tracks.\"  \"Well, Jim, but could not you do the same?\"  \"No good, sah. Me brought up among de whites, eber since me little boy. Dey not believe me if I go and say dat to dem. Jim ready to get killed, if de captain want him; but no good at all him getting killed in dat way.\"  \"I don't want you to get killed in any way, Jim, and if that's your opinion about it, we will give up the plan at once. Can you think of any other way?\"  \"Me tink a lot about him. Me know de captain want very much to catch dose fellows, but Jim no see how dat can be done, for sure. But de best plan me can see is for Jim to go out by himself, and search de country outside white man's bounds. If he find de track of horses, he follow dem up. Me know about de way dey ride off after dey be killing people at de stations. If Jim look, and look, and look berry sharp he find dar track for sure; and once he find dem, he follow dem up. Must be water, for sure, where dey live. Dat good guide to begin with.  \"But captain must not hurry; Jim may be long time before he find dem, dar no saying how long. Captain wish Jim to go?\"  \"Well, Jim, I don't want you to go; that is to say, I should miss you very much; but if you could find out the haunts of these scoundrels, you would be doing me a very great service, as well as the people of all the stations.\"  \"Jim no care about oder people,\" the black said. \"He care for de captain, and will go out and try and find tracks.\"  \"Be careful, Jim, and don't get into trouble with them. If you were to fall into their hands, and they were to find out you were connected with the police, they would shoot you like a dog.\"  \"Dey won't find out. White man not understand. Black fellow all one to him. You hab no fear for Jim. Who look after hoss, while Jim away?\"  \"I shall appoint one of the policemen as my orderly, Jim, and he will look after him.\"  Jim made a contemptuous gesture, to signify that he had little confidence in the power of any white man to look after Tartar. For the rest of the evening Jim was occupied in cooking, and in the morning he was gone.  A week later, Reuben was among the outlying stations again. He had heard nothing of the bush rangers, and no fresh attacks had been made by them, since that upon Dick Caister's station.  One evening, just as he had gone up to bed, he was roused by a sharp knocking at the door of the house in which he was stopping. The settlers had grown cautious now, and an upper window was opened, and Reuben heard the questions, \"Who is there?\" and \"What is it?\"  \"Is Captain Whitney here?\"  \"Yes, do you want him?\"  \"Yes, I want to see him directly.\"  In a minute, Reuben had opened the door.  \"I am Captain Whitney,\" he said. \"What is it?\"  \"I am glad I have found you, sir. They told me at the next station you were here yesterday, but they did not know whether you were here now.  \"Well, sir, I am shepherding some twenty miles away; and this afternoon, just as I had got back to my hut, in runs a black fellow. It is a lonely spot, and I reached for my gun, thinking there was more of them, when he said:  \"'No shoot, me friend. Me sarve Captain Whitney of de police. You know him?'  \"I said I had heard your name.  \"'You know where he is?' the black asked.  \"I said I did not know for certain; but that when my mate went in for grub, two days before, he had heard say that you had been along there that morning.  \"The black said: 'Good. You run and find him.'  \"'Thank you,' says I. 'What for?'  \"'I find out about the bush rangers,' he said. 'You go and tell captain dat, tomorrow morning before de day begins, dey attack the station of Donald's.'  \"'Are you quite sure?' says I.  \"'Quite sure,' says the black. 'Me heard dem say so.'  \"So as I hates the bush rangers like poison, I saddles up and rides into the station; and when I had told the boss, he said I better ride and find you, if I could. You would be at one of the stations this way. I stopped at three of them, and at the last they told me you was here.\"  \"Thank you greatly, my good fellow. Donald's! I don't know the name. Where do they live?\"  \"They have only been here a couple of months,\" Reuben's host, who was standing beside him, replied. \"They bought that station of Anderson's. He was a chicken-hearted young fellow, and sold out because of the bush rangers. There is a man, his wife, and her sister, I believe. I fancy they have got a pretty fair capital. They took Anderson's stock, and have been buying a lot more. That's why the bush rangers are going to attack them.\"  \"I thought,\" Reuben said, \"that Anderson's was not one of the most exposed stations.\"  \"No, that was what everyone told him, before he sold it.\"  \"How far would you say it was from here?\"  \"Thirty-five miles,\" the settler said. \"It's ten miles from Barker's, and I reckon that's twenty-five from here.\"  \"Well, of course I shall ride at once; as there are women there, it makes the case all the more urgent. I have got my orderly, and there are two more men at the station, this side of Barker's.\"  \"I will go, of course,\" Reuben's host said, \"and will bring two men with me.  \"You had best stop here for the night,\" he added, turning to the shepherd. \"You have ridden pretty well thirty miles already, and that at the end of your day's work.\"  \"Not I,\" the man replied. \"Jim Walsh is not going to be lying in bed, with the thought of two women in the hands of them murderous bush rangers. You might lend me a fresh horse, if you have got one. If not, I must try and pick one up at one of the stations, as we go along.\"  \"I have plenty of horses in the yard,\" the settler said.  \"Well, let us be off as soon as possible,\" Reuben put in. \"It's past twelve o'clock now, and we have thirty-five miles to ride, and to stop at two or three places, so we haven't a minute to lose.\"  In a few minutes the horses were saddled, and the six men dashed off at full gallop. At three stations, which they passed on the way to Barker's, they picked up seven more. There was but little delay as, the instant the news was told, the men hurried up, saddled their horses, and rode after the party, who pushed straight on when they had told their story. At Barker's they were joined by Barker himself, and two men. Two constables had also been picked up on the way.  The others overtook them here, and the party now numbered twenty men. There was a pause to allow all to come up, and to give the horses breathing time, for they had traversed twenty-five miles at a rapid pace, with scarce a halt.  Mrs. Barker herself prepared a meal, to which, while the horses got their breath, their riders did justice. Then they mounted again, and rode for Donald's.  \"It all depends,\" Reuben said, \"as to our being there in time, whether the man keeps a careful watch. If he does they may not attack till the doors are opened, and then make a sudden rush and catch them unawares. If, when they arrive there, they find the whole house is asleep, they may burst in at once.\"  \"I think they will be careful,\" Mr. Barker said. \"I know Donald is very anxious; and no wonder, with two women with him, both young and pretty--quite out of the way, indeed. In fact, he told me the first day I rode over, he had no idea of the unsettled state of the district, and wouldn't have taken the place if he had, not even if Anderson had given it as a gift; and he wrote down at once to some agent, and told him to sell the place again, for whatever he can get for it; but I expect there will be some trouble in finding a purchaser. The district here has had a bad name for some time and, if Donald had not arrived fresh from England, he must have heard of it.  \"Listen! I thought I heard the sound of firing.\"  There was a momentary pause, but no one could hear anything. Nevertheless, they went on at redoubled speed. They were now within three miles of the station.  Suddenly, on coming over a crest, a faint light was seen ahead. It increased rapidly, and a tongue of flame leapt up.  \"Come on, lads!\" Reuben exclaimed. \"The scoundrels are at their work.\"  At a hard gallop they crossed the intervening ground, until they were within half a mile of the station, from which a broad sheet of flame was leaping up. Then Reuben drew rein, for he had outridden the rest of his party, and it was important that all should ride together.  \"Now,\" he said, when they were gathered; \"let us keep in a close body.  \"If they ride off as we arrive there, do you, Jones and Wilkins, stop at the station and see if you can render any help. If not, follow us at once.  \"Let the rest keep on with me, straight after the bush rangers. There is already a faint light in the east. In half an hour it will be broad day so, even if they have got a start, we shall be able to follow them. Now, come on.\"  At the head of his party, Reuben rode at full speed down to the station. As he neared it he saw, to his satisfaction, that the flames arose from some of the outbuildings, and that the house itself was still intact; but as no firing had been heard, he hoped that it still resisted.  There was a shrill whistle, when the party approached within a hundred yards. Men were seen to dash out of the house, and to leap upon their horses.  With a shout, Reuben rode down. He did not pause for a moment, but dashed past the house in the direction in which the bush rangers had fled. They were, he knew, but a hundred yards ahead; but it was not light enough for him to see them, especially after riding through the glare of the fire. The sound of the horses' feet, however, afforded an indication; but as there was no saying in which direction they might turn, he was forced to halt, every two or three minutes, to listen.  To his mortification he found that, each time, the sound was getting more indistinct; for the speed at which they had travelled had taken so much out of the horses, that they were unable to compete with the fresher animals ridden by the bush rangers, who were all well mounted, many of the best horses in the district having been stolen by them. At last the sound could be heard no longer, and Reuben was reluctantly obliged to give the order to halt; for he feared he might override the trail.  \"It is no use,\" he said, as he reined in his horse. \"They will know as well as we do that they are out of hearing now, and might turn off anywhere. It is terribly annoying. We are too late to save the station, and the bush rangers have escaped.  \"However, we will take up their trail as soon as it is daylight. Indeed, I am expecting every moment to be joined by Jim, who is sure to be somewhere near, and can perhaps guide us direct to their hiding place.\"  Deeply disappointed, the party dismounted from their horses.  \"The scoundrels must have had someone on the watch,\" Reuben said, \"or they would never have taken the alarm so soon. I am sorry, now, that we did not send a party round to the other side before we charged down upon them; but my blood was on fire at the sight of the burning station, and at the thought of the women in the hands of those scoundrels.\"  A minute later, a man rode up at full speed from behind.  \"Is that you, Jones?\" Reuben said, stepping forward.  \"Yes, sir,\" the man replied, reining in his horse. \"I left Wilkins behind, and rode on to tell you what had happened.\"  \"What has happened, Jones?\"  \"It's a bad business, sir, a shocking bad business; but it might have been worse. It seems they broke in about half an hour before we got there. One of the hands was supposed to be on watch in the stockyard; but either he was asleep, or they crept up to him and killed him before he could give the alarm. Then they got up to the house and burst in the door, before the others were fairly awake.  \"They shot the two hands at once; but I suppose, as their blood wasn't up, and no resistance was offered, they thought they had plenty of time for fooling; for they must have reckoned that no force they need be afraid of could be got together, for three or four hours. So they made Donald and his wife and sister get breakfast for them. The women, it seemed had got pistols, and both swore they would blow out their brains if any man laid a hand on them. However, the bush rangers did not touch them, though they told them they would have to go off with them.  \"They made Donald sit down at one end of the table, while their captain took the other; and the two women, half dressed as they were, waited on them. It was lucky for them that we were so close when the alarm was given, for all made a rush to get to their horses; only the captain stopping a moment, to let fly at Donald.\"  \"Did he kill him?\" Reuben asked.  \"No, sir, the bullet hit him in the body, and the ladies were crying over him when I went in, thinking he was dead. I thought so, too, but I found he was breathing. They poured some brandy down his throat, and presently he opened his eyes; then, as there was nothing for me to do, I thought I had best gallop on and give you the news, for I knew that you would be anxious to know what had taken place.\"  \"Thank you, Jones, you did quite right. What an escape those poor ladies have had! Another quarter of an hour, we might have been too late, for those villains would not have kept up the farce long.\"  \"No, sir, especially as they were drinking wine. The table was all covered with bottles.\"  \"You did not see anything of Jim, did you?\" Reuben inquired.  \"No, sir, I did not see or hear anyone stirring about the place.\"  Reuben gave a loud cooey.  \"That will bring him, if he is anywhere within hearing.\"  But no answering call came back.  \"I hope nothing has happened to the poor fellow,\" Reuben said, after a pause.  \"He could not possibly be here by this time,\" Mr. Barker said. \"The place where he warned the shepherd must be sixty miles from here.\"  \"Yes, quite that; but he can run nearly as fast as a horse can go, and he would be ten miles nearer here, in a straight line, than the way the man went round to fetch me.\"  As soon as it became light they followed the track, which was plainly visible; but when they had gone half a mile further, there was a general cry of dismay--the ground was trampled in every direction.  \"Confound it,\" Mr. Barker said, \"they have done us! Do you see, they have ridden right into the middle of a large herd of cattle, and have driven them off in every direction; and have, no doubt, themselves scattered among the cattle. They may go like that for three or four miles, and then draw off from the cattle at any spot where the ground is hard, and no tracks will be left; to meet again at some appointed place, maybe fifty miles away.\"  \"Then you don't think it's any use in pursuing them?\" Reuben asked, in a tone of deep disappointment.  \"Not a bit in the world,\" Mr. Barker replied decisively. \"If we had a native tracker with us, he might possibly follow one horse's track among those of all the cattle, discover where he separates from them, and take up his trail; but I doubt, even then, if he would be successful. These fellows know that a strong party is in pursuit of them, and each of them will do everything they can to throw us off the scent. They are sure not to go straight to their place of meeting, but each will take circuitous routes, and will make for thick bush, where it will be next to impossible for even a native to follow them. No, they have done us, this time.\"  \"Well, gentlemen, I hope you will all wait as long as you can at the station here. If my boy has not been shot by those scoundrels, he is sure to find his way here; and will be able, in all probability, to set us on the right track.  \"At any rate, though the bush rangers have given us the slip, we may congratulate ourselves on our morning's work. We have at least saved those poor ladies.\"  So saying, Reuben turned and, with the party, rode slowly back to the station. On arriving there, they dismounted and unsaddled their horses, and turned them into a paddock close to the house, to feed. Reuben and Mr. Barker then went up to the house. The constable who had been left behind came out.  \"Well, Wilkins, how is Mr. Donald, and how are the ladies?\"  \"He is sensible now, sir; but I don't think there's much chance for him.\"  \"We ought to get a surgeon, at once,\" Reuben said. \"Who is the nearest, Mr. Barker?\"  \"The nearest is Ruskin.\"  \"Is there no one nearer than that?\" Reuben asked. \"Why, he lives about halfway between where I was sleeping last night, and my own place. It must be seventy miles away.\"  \"He's the nearest,\" Mr. Barker said; \"take my word for it.\"  \"I'll tell you what will be the best plan,\" Reuben's host of the night before said. \"I will ride at once to Mr. Barker's and, if he will let me get a fresh horse there, I will gallop straight back to my place, and will send a man off the moment I arrive there to fetch Ruskin.  \"It is only eight o'clock now. I can be home before noon, and my man will do the next stage in a little over four hours. If he finds Ruskin in, he can get to my place by ten o'clock at night, and can start again at daybreak; so by eleven o'clock tomorrow he can be here. If he isn't here by that time, it will be because he was out when my man got there. At any rate, he is sure to start directly he gets the message.\"  \"That will be the best plan,\" Reuben agreed; \"and I am sure the ladies will be greatly obliged to you, when I tell them what you have undertaken.\"  \"Oh, that's nothing,\" the settler said. \"We don't think much of a seventy miles' ride, here.\"  Without any further delay, the settler saddled his horse and went off at a gallop towards Mr. Barker's, where he was to get a fresh mount.  \"And now, how are the ladies, Wilkins?\"  \"They are keeping up bravely, sir. I think, as far as they are concerned, Donald's being hit has done them good. It has given them something to do, and they have not had time to think about what they have gone through, and what a narrow escape they have had.\"  \"Which room are they in, Wilkins?\"  \"In there to the left, sir.\"  \"As you have seen them, Wilkins, you had better go in and tell them that we have sent off, at once, to fetch a surgeon; and that they may rely upon his being here some time tomorrow, we hope before noon. Ask if there is anything that we can do for them, or for Mr. Donald.\"  The policeman went in, and Reuben called one of his other men.  \"Perkins, do you, Jones, and Rider go in and fetch out the bodies of the men who have been killed. Don't make more noise than you can help about it. Carry them out to that shed there, and then get a bucket and wash down the floors, wherever there are bloodstains about. I want to have the place straight, so that those poor ladies may avoid seeing anything to recall the scene they have passed through. Of course, you won't go into the room where they are now.\"  Three or four of the settlers at once volunteered to set to work to dig a grave.  \"Choose a place a bit away from the house,\" one of them said. \"The farther, the better; it will remind them of this affair, whenever they see it.\"  While Reuben was arranging this point, the constable had come out and told Mr. Barker the ladies would be glad to see him.  \"It's a terrible business,\" the settler said to Reuben, as he turned to go into the house. \"I feel downright afraid of facing them. To think how bright and pretty they looked, when I rode over here ten days ago; and now there they are, broken hearted.\"  He returned in a few minutes.  \"How is Donald?\" was the general question.  \"He is hard hit,\" the settler said, \"just under the ribs on the right-hand side. I expect the fellow aimed at his head, but he was starting from his seat at the moment. He isn't in much pain. I have told them they must keep him perfectly quiet, and not let him move till the surgeon comes.  \"They have asked me to see about everything. It's better we should not be going in and out of the house, as he must be kept perfectly quiet; so I think we had better establish ourselves under that big tree over there. There are some sheep half a mile over that rise, if two of you will go over, kill one and fetch it in. If you will light a fire under that tree, I will hand out from the house flour, tea, sugar, and some cooking things.\"  There was a general murmur of approval, for all felt silent and awed at being so close to the house of death and sorrow. Two men got their horses, and rode off to fetch the sheep. The others carried the various articles requisite up to the place fixed for the bivouac, while Wilkins was installed in the house, to assist in anything that might be required there.  \"The poor things told me to tell you, captain, how grateful they felt to you for the exertions you have made. I told them how it was we came to be here; and how you had ridden, when you got the news, to be here in time. Mrs. Donald did not say much, poor thing, she seemed half dazed; but her sister, who seems wonderfully cool and collected, quite realized what they had escaped; and there's many a young fellow who would give a good deal, to win that look of gratitude she gave me when she said:  \"'I shall never forget what I owe you all.'  \"I am just going to send off one of my men, to fetch my wife over here. It will be a comfort to the two girls, for they are little more, to have a woman with them.\"  \"There's nothing to be done for Donald, I suppose?\" Reuben asked.  \"Nothing. The wound is hardly bleeding at all. I told them that, as far as I knew, the best thing was to keep on it a flannel dipped in warm water, and wrung out; and that they should give him a little broth, or weak brandy and water, whenever he seemed faint. My surgery does not go beyond that. If it had been a smashed finger, or a cut with an axe, or even a broken limb, I might have been some good; for I have seen plenty of accidents of all kinds, since I came out twenty years ago, but a bullet wound in the body is beyond me, altogether.\"  After the meal was cooked and eaten, there was a consultation as to what had best be done next. Two or three of the settlers who were married men said that they would go home, as their wives would be anxious about them. The rest agreed to stop for, at any rate, another day.  Mr. Barker had found out from Mrs. Donald's sister the direction in which the sheep and cattle were grazing, and two or three of the party rode off to tell the shepherds and herdsmen--for there were three men on the farm, in addition to those who had been killed--what had happened; and to tell them that they had better bring the sheep and cattle up to within a mile or so of the house, and come in themselves for their stores, when required.  A grave was now dug, and the three men buried. In the afternoon Mrs. Barker arrived, and at once took charge of the affairs of the house. In the evening Mr. Barker came up to the fire round which the men were sitting.  \"Will you come down to the house, Captain Whitney? The ladies have expressed a wish to see you. They want to thank you for what you have done.\"  \"There is nothing to thank about,\" Reuben said. \"I only did my duty as a police officer, and am disgusted at those scoundrels having got away. I have done all I could, since I arrived; but I can't help feeling, being in command of the force here, that we are to some extent to blame for these fellows carrying on, as they have done for months, without being caught.\"  \"I think you had better come down, Whitney,\" Mr. Barker said. \"There is something bright and hopeful about you, and I think that a talk with you might cheer the poor things up a bit. When people are in the state they are, they seem to turn to everyone for a gleam of hope, and comfort.\"  \"Oh, if you think I can do any good, of course I will go; though I would rather stop here, by a good way.\"  So saying, Reuben went down with Mr. Barker to the house. A lady met them at the door.  \"Arthur has just dozed off,\" she whispered. \"Mrs. Barker is sitting by him. She insisted on our coming out. Will you come in here?\"  As silently as possible, the two men followed her into the kitchen, and closed the door after them. The fire was blazing brightly, Wilkins having piled on some fresh logs before going out to smoke a pipe. Mrs. Donald was sitting in a dejected attitude, by its right, when her sister entered with Mr. Barker and Reuben. She rose and, coming towards Reuben, said:  \"How can we thank you, sir, for the exertions you have made, and for having saved us from I dare not think what fate? As long as we live, my sister and I will bless you.\"  \"I can assure you, Mrs. Donald,\" Reuben said, \"that I have done nothing but my duty, and I only regret that we did not arrive half an hour earlier.\"  \"Ah, if you had!\" Mrs. Donald said. \"But there--we must not repine--even in my sorrow, I feel how much we have to be thankful for.\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" her sister said, \"we have truly reason to be grateful.\"  As she spoke, Reuben looked at her more and more intently. He had started when she first spoke, outside the house.  \"Good heavens!\" he exclaimed, \"is it possible, or am I dreaming? Surely you are Miss Kate Ellison?\"  \"Certainly I am,\" she said in surprise, at his tone; \"but I don't think--I don't remember--why, surely it is not Reuben Whitney?\"    Chapter 15: At Donald's.   It is difficult to say whether Kate Ellison, or Reuben Whitney was the most surprised at this unexpected meeting. The former, indeed, was aware that Reuben had come out to Australia; but that the boy, whose cause she had championed, should now stand before her as the officer, to whose energy and activity she and her sister owed so much, seemed almost incredible.  But the surprise of Reuben was at least equal to that which she felt. He could scarcely credit the evidence of his senses, at seeing before him the young lady whom he had believed to be thousands of miles away, in England. As is usual in these cases, the girl was the first to recover from her surprise.  \"And it is to you we owe so much!\" she said, holding out her hand. \"Mr. Barker spoke of our preserver as Captain Whitney; but somehow it never, for a moment, occurred to me to connect the name with you.  \"Is it not extraordinary, Alice?\" she said, turning to her sister.  \"The surprise to me is even greater than to you, Miss Ellison,\" Reuben said. \"Mr. Barker always spoke of Mrs. Donald and her sister, and I had not the least idea that you were in the colony. My mother wrote to me, a year ago, telling me of the changes which have taken place; but although she said that you had left Tipping, she said nothing about your coming out here.\"  Reuben had, in fact, been much disturbed in his mind, a year previously, by hearing from his mother that Mr. Ellison had died suddenly. He had, it seemed, lost a large sum of money, from the failure of a bank in which he was a shareholder, and the blow had killed him. The estate was, when Mrs. Whitney wrote, for sale.  Reuben had written back, begging his mother to send him all particulars that she could gather; but communication between Australia and England was in those days very slow, and no answer had yet been received. Another letter had, indeed, told him that the estate had been sold. Mrs. Ellison, he knew, had died a few weeks after he had left England.  \"It is very simple,\" Kate Ellison said quietly; \"although of course it seems so strange to you, our being here. My sister was engaged to Mr. Donald before papa's death and, as you know, almost everything went owing to that bank; and as I had no reason for staying in England, I came out here with them.\"  Reuben subsequently learned that Mr. Ellison had disapproved of the engagement of his daughter with Mr. Donald, who was the younger son of a neighbouring squire. When, after his death, Mr. Ellison's affairs were wound up, it was found that there remained only the six thousand pounds, which his wife had brought him, to be divided between her daughters. Mr. Donald possessed no capital, and had no prospects at home. He and Alice were quietly married, three months after her father's death, and had sailed a week later for New South Wales; where, as land could be taken up at a nominal price, it was thought that her little fortune would be ample to start them comfortably. All this, however, Reuben did not learn until some time later.  After chatting for a short time, he returned to the camp fire.  \"This is very awkward, Mr. Barker,\" Mrs. Donald said; \"do you know that Captain Whitney was, at one time, gardener's boy to our father?\"  \"Oh, Alice!\" her sister exclaimed, \"what difference can that make?\"  \"It seems to me,\" Mrs. Donald said, \"that it makes a very great difference. You know mamma never thought well of him, and it is very awkward, now, finding him here in such a position; especially as he has laid us under an obligation to him.  \"Do you not think so, Mr. Barker?\"  \"I do not pretend to know anything about such matters, Mrs. Donald,\" Mr. Barker said bluntly; \"and I shouldn't have thought it could have made any difference to you, what the man was who had saved you from such a fate as would have befallen you, had it not been for his energy. I can only say that Captain Whitney is a gentleman with whom anyone here, or in the old country, would be glad to associate. I may say that when he came here, three or four months ago, my friend Mr. Hudson--one of the leading men in the colony--wrote to me, saying that Captain Whitney was one of his most intimate friends, that he was in every respect a good fellow, and that he himself was under a lifelong obligation to him; for he had, at the risk of his life, when on the way out, saved that of his daughter when she was attacked by a mad Malay at the Cape.  \"More than that, I did not inquire. It was nothing to me whether he was born a prince, or a peasant.\"  Mrs. Donald coloured hotly, at the implied reproof of Mr. Barker's words. She had always shared her mother's prejudices against Reuben Whitney, and she had not been long enough, in the colony, to become accustomed to the changes of position which are there so frequent.  \"You do not understand, Mr. Barker,\" she said pettishly. \"It was not only that he was a boy employed in the family. There were other circumstances--\"  \"Oh, Alice!\" Kate broke out, \"how can you speak of such things? Here are we at present, owing more than our lives to this man, and you are going now to damage him by raking up that miserable old story.  \"Mr. Barker,\" she said impulsively, \"my father, one of the most just, as well as one of the most kind of men, had the highest opinion of Reuben Whitney; believe me, there was nothing in the circumstances to which Alice alludes which could cast the slightest slur upon his character.\"  \"I feel certain of that, my dear young lady,\" Mr. Barker said, \"even without your assurance. Your sister is shaken by the events of the day, and no wonder; and I am quite sure that when she thinks this matter over she will see that, whatever her preconceived ideas may be, it would be most ungrateful and ungenerous to breathe a single word in disparagement of Captain Whitney.\"  So saying, he turned on his heel and left the room; and Kate, wishing to avoid further words on the matter with her sister, followed his example.  Mrs. Donald's reflections were not pleasant. She felt that Mr. Barker's reproof was well deserved, and that she had acted ungratefully and ungenerously. As a rule, Mr. Ellison's elder daughter was by no means of an unkind disposition; but she was essentially her mother's child.  The question of Reuben Whitney had been one which had caused more serious dissension, between her father and mother, than any she ever remembered. She had taken her mother's view of the case, while Kate had agreed with her father; and although the subject had been dropped, by mutual consent, it had been a very sore one; and at the sight of Reuben, the remembrance of the old unpleasantness had caused her to play a part which she could not but feel was mean and unworthy. She felt angry at herself--angry with Mr. Barker, with her sister, and with Reuben.  She was standing there, with her lips pressed together as she thought over the matter, when Mrs. Barker came into the room.  \"He is awake now, my dear. Perhaps you had better go in to him.\"  Then she dismissed from her mind the events of the last few minutes, and went in to take her place by the side of her husband. But as, during the long hours of the night, she sat there and thought over what had passed since the preceding evening, the thought of how much she owed to Reuben Whitney was uppermost in her mind; and when in the morning Mrs. Barker relieved her, she went into the other room, where Mr. Barker and Kate were about to sit down to breakfast, and said:  \"Mr. Barker, I thank you for what you said to me last night. You were right and I was wrong. I was ungrateful, and ungenerous. I can only say that it was a very sore subject, and that in my surprise I thought of the past, and not the present. Believe me, I am very sorry for what I said.\"  \"That is quite enough, Mrs. Donald,\" Mr. Barker said heartily. \"I am very glad you have said what you have. I was sure that you would, upon reflection, feel that whatever the old grievance might have been, it could not weigh an instant against what you owe to that young fellow now. Let us say no more on the subject. You were shaken and not yourself, and I was wrong in taking you up so sharply, under the circumstances.\"  Kate said nothing, but her face showed that she was greatly pleased at her sister's change of tone.  \"What is going to be done, Mr. Barker?\" Mrs. Donald asked. \"Of course, the friends who came to our rescue cannot stay here; and there is no chance of my husband being moved, for a long time.\"  \"I am afraid not, indeed,\" Mr. Barker said. \"Most of them will leave this afternoon, in time to get back to their stations tonight.  \"I have been speaking with Captain Whitney, and he says that he with his men will certainly stay here, for the present. He sent off a messenger, last night, for six more of his men to join him here; for he still hopes to get news from his native boy, which may set him on the tracks of the bush rangers. You need, however, be under no alarm; for I think there is no chance, whatever, of the bush rangers returning.  \"By the way, Whitney would like to speak to you, after breakfast. He wants you to give him as minute a description as you can of the fellows you saw. We have already descriptions of four or five of them, given by men whom they have stuck up; but the band must have increased lately, and any particulars might be useful.\"  Reuben came round in a quarter of an hour later. Mr. Barker fetched him into the room where Mrs. Barker and Kate were sitting.  \"Mr. Donald is no worse, I am glad to hear,\" he said, as he shook hands with the two ladies.  \"I see no change whatever,\" Mrs. Barker said. \"He is conscious, but does not speak much. He asked me, this morning, to tell you and all your friends how deeply he feels indebted to you.\"  \"His thanks are due to the settlers, rather than to me, Mrs. Barker. They were volunteers, you know, while I was simply on duty. We had, however, one common interest--to get here in time to save the station and, above all, to catch and break up this gang of scoundrels.  \"And now, Miss Ellison, if you feel equal to it, would you kindly give us an account of what happened? Mr. Barker said that he would not ask you, yesterday; but something, perhaps, let drop by chance, might serve as an indication to us as to the direction in which these fellows have gone.\"  \"I will tell you, certainly,\" the girl said, her face paling a little; \"although it is dreadful, even now, to think of. We of course had no idea of attack, and had gone to bed as usual. One of the men was always on guard, on the outside of the house; for these attacks made Mr. Donald nervous for the safety of my sister, and myself. Simpson was on guard that night. Whether he went to sleep or not, I cannot say.\"  \"He did, Miss Ellison,\" Reuben interrupted. \"We found his body round by the end of the house. He had evidently been sitting down on a log, against the house; and had been killed by a crushing blow with some heavy instrument, probably one of the tools they used for breaking in.\"  \"The first we knew about it,\" Kate went on, \"was a tremendous crash downstairs, which was followed by a continuous thundering noise. I think they must have burst the door in with crowbars, or something--that was the first noise we heard--but a strong wooden bar, inside, kept the door in its place till they battered it down with a log.  \"I hurried on some things. Just as I had done--it was not a minute, I think, from the time I woke--Alice ran in, partly dressed, too. I had heard Mr. Donald shout to the men, then there was another great crash as the bar gave way, and then some shots were fired.  \"Mr. Donald had been standing just behind the door, and had fired through it the moment before it gave way. He had not time to step back, and was knocked down by the door. It was fortunate for him, for the bush rangers rushed in and shot down the two men, instantly.  \"Alice would have run down to see what had happened to her husband, but I would not let her out of my room. She could have done no good, and might have been shot. Then we heard them moving about the house, swearing and using all sorts of horrible language. Then they shouted up to us to come down, or else they would come and fetch us; so we opened the door, and came down at once.  \"Alice gave a little cry of joy, as she entered the room and saw her husband standing unhurt, though still looking dazed and confused from his blow.  \"The leader of the band--I suppose you have not seen him, Captain Whitney?\"  \"No, indeed,\" Reuben said. \"I would give a good deal to catch sight of him.\"  \"What do you know about him?\"  \"I only know that he is a young fellow, not much older than I am myself. His was a life sentence. He was concerned in a burglary in the country, in which two old ladies were killed. Two of his accomplices were hung for it, but in consideration of his youth, and as it was not proved that he took an absolute part in the murder, he got off with a life sentence. I heard about the case from Captain Wilson.  \"He came out here about a year after I did. He had not been here a month when he killed one of the guard, and made his escape. Since that time he has been a scourge to the colony. Not a week has passed without complaints of his bailing up and robbing teamsters on their way down to Sydney. He soon gathered two or three others about him, and his daring and impudence soon made him a noted character. Several times he, with two other men, rode into good-sized villages and, pistol in hand, went from house to house, and carried off every shilling in the place. He has ridden into large stores single handed, and compelled the storekeepers to hand over the contents of their tills. Sometimes they bring spare horses with them, and ride off laden with groceries and stores. He has committed at least a score of murders, always using his pistol at the slightest show of opposition; and sometimes murdering, apparently, from pure love of the thing.\"  \"Do you know his name?\" Kate asked.  \"His real name? No, I don't know that I ever heard it. He is always spoken of as Fothergill.\"  \"I will tell you his real name, presently,\" Kate said. \"As my sister and I came into the kitchen, he took off his hat and made a deep bow and said:  \"'Ladies, me and my mates are sorry to put you to any inconvenience; but as we happen to be hungry, we must trouble you to get us some supper. You need not bother to make tea, wine is good enough for us.'  \"Of course, as we were in their hands there was nothing to do but to obey his orders; so we spread the cloth, and brought out what there was in the larder. Then we fetched in the wine, and I brought several bottles of spirits; for, as I whispered to Alice, 'If they get drunk, we may be able to get away from them.'  \"Before they sat down, the captain told two of his men to go upstairs with us and fetch down our watches and jewelry, and the money there was in the house. Mr. Donald had already told them where they would find that.  \"We lit four candles, and put them on the table. The captain ordered Mr. Donald to sit down facing him, saying with a sort of mock politeness that they should not really enjoy their food, unless their host took the head of the table. Several times, while they were eating, I saw the captain looking hard at Alice and me. Presently he said:  \"'I have it now. Why, you are the Ellison girls, ain't you?'  \"I was astonished, as you may suppose, but I said:  \"'I am Miss Ellison, and Mrs. Donald is my sister.'  \"'By Jove, who would have thought it!' he said. 'Do you know who I am?'  \"I said I didn't, although really I seemed to have some sort of recollection of his face.  \"'Why,' he said, 'don't you remember Tom Thorne, whose father the squire turned out of the public house? And to think, now, that the squire's daughters are waiting on me. This is a piece of luck.  \"'Well, my dears,' he went on, with a horrible grin, 'you need not tell me how you came here now, you will have plenty of time for that. We have made up our minds to take you both with us, for it's a horrible lonely life in the bush, without the pleasure of ladies' society. But I never dreamt that I was in for such a slice of luck as this.'  \"Mr. Donald jumped from his seat as the fellow spoke, but in a moment he levelled a pistol at him and shouted:  \"'Sit down or I fire.'  \"Alice rushed to her husband, and pushed him down into his seat.  \"'I had rather die than go with you,' I said to him quietly.  \"'Perhaps so, my dear,' he replied; 'but you see, you haven't got the choice.'  \"Then he went on taunting us about old times, and especially reminding me that I had got him a thrashing, over breaking the school house window. When I went out to get them some more wine, for they wouldn't touch the spirits, I got a knife and hid it in my dress; for I made up my mind to kill myself, rather than that.  \"A little later I stole upstairs and brought down a brace of pistols, which Mr. Donald kept under his pillow, and slipped one into Alice's hand. Presently they began to get noisy, and the captain ordered me to come and sit on his knee. Then Alice and I showed the pistols, and said we would shoot ourselves, if one of them laid a finger on us.  \"The captain muttered some order to his men, which I didn't hear; but I guessed it was to leave us alone, for the present. I had no doubt what they intended to do was to catch us off our guard, and wrench the pistols from us; and I was glad I had the knife hidden away, for if they did carry us off, I was sure to be able to find some opportunity for using that.  \"It was awful!\" the girl said, putting her hand to her face. \"Awful to be standing there and hearing them laughing and shouting and cursing. I was tempted to go behind him, and shoot him suddenly; but the others would have been just as bad, and we should have gained nothing by it. I would not go through that half hour again, for all the money in the world.  \"The men had just finished and were getting up from the table, and I knew the moment was coming fast, when we heard a sudden shout outside. My heart gave a bound, as they rushed to the door. The captain fired a shot at Mr. Donald, just as he was getting up; and as he ran out, shouted to me:  \"'I will come back for you, missy.'  \"If it had not been for Mr. Donald falling to the ground, I should have fainted; but Alice called me as she ran to him, and I think I was trying to lift him up when the constable ran in, and I knew we were saved.\"  Reuben had given a sudden start, when Kate Ellison mentioned the name of Tom Thorne, but he had not interrupted her.  \"I had a score against that scoundrel before,\" he said, as she finished; \"and by heavens, I will settle accounts with him when I meet him. I could have forgiven him for the wrongs he did me; but now--\" and his fingers closed on the hilt of the pistol in his belt.  Kate, who had been looking down as she told her story, raised her eyes at the tone of intense passion in the young officer's words; and a sudden flush of colour mounted into her cheeks, which were pale from the terror and excitement through which she had gone.  \"I say ditto to Captain Whitney,\" Mr. Barker said. \"I don't know anything about his previous doings against him; but I know that, if ever I come across the scoundrel, I will shoot him as a dog.  \"Even you can't say anything against that, wife, though you are always on the side of mercy.\"  \"No,\" Mrs. Barker agreed. \"I would say nothing to stay your hand there, John. Even putting this aside, he has committed a score of murders; and there will be no more wrong, in shooting him, than there would be in killing a wild beast.  \"That is the sound of a horse coming, at a gallop. Perhaps it is the doctor.\"  Hurrying to the door they found, to their great satisfaction, that Mrs. Barker's guess was verified. The surgeon had been at home when the messenger arrived, and had started five minutes later, arriving three or four hours earlier than they had even ventured to hope.  Mrs. Barker at once led the way into the next room and, a few minutes later, came out again for hot water and sponges. Kate had stolen away upstairs, when the surgeon had entered the house. The two men remained to hear the verdict.  \"He is going to probe the wound. He can give no opinion, yet, till he discovers what course it has taken; but he says that it is a favourable symptom that the pulse is so strong and regular. He wishes you both to come in, as it will be necessary to hold his patient's hands, while he is making the examination.\"  \"I cannot give any positive opinion,\" the surgeon said, when he had finished the examination. \"I can't find the ball, and I cannot tell for certain what course it took, after entering; but I think, judging from the pulse, and I may say from the expression of his face, that no vital part is injured.\"  An exclamation of thankfulness broke from Mrs. Donald.  \"We must not be too sanguine,\" Mr. Ruskin went on; \"but there is certainly strong ground for hope. I shall be able to give a more definite opinion, in the course of a few hours. He must, of course, be kept perfectly quiet; with no more nourishment than is absolutely necessary, and that in the shape of beef tea. I should make him a bed here. We will manage to slide a door under him, and lift him on to it, with as little movement as possible.  \"At any rate, madam,\" he said, turning to Mrs. Donald, \"I can congratulate you upon the fact that the bullet did not strike a couple of inches higher. Had it done so, my ride would have been a useless one.\"  A bed was at once brought from a room above and made up, and Mr. Donald was placed upon it, in the manner which Mr. Ruskin had suggested. Then with lightened hearts the party, with the exception of his wife, left the room.  Kate and Mrs. Barker at once set to to prepare a meal for the surgeon; while Reuben went over to give his companions the good news, that the surgeon had strong hopes that Mr. Donald would recover.  In the afternoon all the party, with the exception of Mr. and Mrs. Barker and the constables, rode off to their respective stations; assuring Reuben of their readiness to assemble again, at once, should he obtain news which would afford a hope that the gang could be traced.  A few hours later, the other four constables for whom Reuben had sent rode up. An outhouse was now prepared for the reception of the police, Reuben himself taking up his abode there, although Mrs. Donald strongly urged him to come into the house; but with Mr. and Mrs. Barker and the surgeon there, and the time of one of the ladies taken up with the wounded man, Reuben thought that their hands were perfectly full, and said that he should prefer to mess and sleep with his men.  \"You see, Mrs. Donald,\" he said, as she tried to induce him to alter his determination, \"I shall have to be sending out men and receiving reports, and may be obliged to ride out in the middle of the night; therefore, you see, as absolute quiet is ordered for your husband, it will be far better for me to be outside the house; as the coming and going would be sure to disturb him, and he would naturally want to know what is going on.\"  \"You will not, I hope, take all your party away in pursuit of these men, Captain Whitney,\" she said anxiously. \"They might get up some false alarm, to take you away, and then come down upon the house again. I have been too much taken up with my husband to think much about it; but although Kate keeps up bravely, I know that she is greatly shaken, and terribly anxious. I don't know whether she told you; but it was to her, chiefly, that horrible man spoke; and it was she he told, as he rushed out, that he would come back to fetch her. She will never have a moment's peace, or tranquillity, till we hear that he is either killed or taken.\"  \"Nor shall I,\" Reuben said. \"I do not think that the scoundrel will dare to attempt to carry out his threat to come back again; but with so daring a villain, it would be rash to omit the smallest precaution. You may be quite sure, Mrs. Donald, that in no case will I leave the house unprotected; and that if I should be called away I will leave two men here who, during my absence, will remain in the house; and with them, Mr. Barker, and the doctor, you may feel perfectly assured that no open attack will be made.  \"But I cannot impress too strongly upon you that, seeing the man with whom we have to deal, your sister should not stir outside the house; until we have caught him, or until Mr. Donald is so far recovered as to be able to be removed. I will not tell her so myself; because I see that, now the strain is over, she is greatly shaken, and I would not add to her anxiety; but if you could break it to her, as if it were your own idea, that she had better keep within doors until this fellow's caught, I am sure that it will be well.\"  \"You will come in this evening, I hope; and always of an evening, Captain Whitney. It will make a change, and cheer us up; besides, we want to hear all about your adventures, since we saw you last.\"  This Reuben gladly promised and, after it was dark, and he had placed a sentry, he came into the house. Mrs. Barker was on duty in the sick room; and Reuben, at Mrs. Donald's request, gave them an account of the voyage out, and of the circumstances which had led to his entering the police.  He would have passed very briefly over the affair at the Cape, but by many questions Mrs. Donald succeeded in eliciting from him all the details of the story.  \"It was a gallant action, indeed,\" she said warmly. \"You certainly saved the lives of those two girls, at a terrible risk of your own.\"  \"To make the romance complete, Whitney,\" Mr. Barker remarked, \"you ought to have married Miss Hudson.\"  \"Unfortunately, you see,\" Reuben said with a smile, \"in the first place I was only a boy, and she was two years my senior; in the next, and much more important place, she happened to be in love with someone else; and I did not happen to be in love with her, though she was, I admit, a very charming young lady, and had been extremely kind to me.\"  \"How was that, Whitney?\" Mr. Barker asked. \"Eighteen is a susceptible age. I can only account for your coldness on the supposition that you had left your heart in England.\"  \"I fancy my heart was, then, where it is now,\" Reuben rejoined, with a slight smile.  \"In the right place, eh, Whitney?\"  \"In the right place,\" Reuben repeated quietly.  At this moment Mrs. Barker entered, and said that Mr. Donald would be glad if Reuben would come and sit with him, for a little time.  \"Don't let him talk much,\" Mr. Ruskin said. \"The less he talks, the better; but your talking to him, for a time, will cheer him up and do him good.\"  \"I am glad to see you going on so well, Mr. Donald,\" Reuben said heartily, as he entered. \"The doctor says you are not to talk much; but you are to play the part of a listener.\"  \"Do you think you will catch these fellows?\" was Mr. Donald's first question.  \"I will catch them, sooner or later,\" Reuben said. \"I will run them down if they are above ground; but I can take no steps in the matter until I hear from my black boy. I have been expecting him to turn up, ever since I got here; and shall begin to be afraid that those scoundrels have ill treated him, if he does not turn up before long.\"  \"My wife has been telling me that they knew you at home, Whitney; and that she and her people did you some terrible injustice, somehow. But she wouldn't go into the matter. Curious, isn't it, your meeting at this end of the world; and that, too, at such a moment?\"  \"It is curious,\" Reuben said; \"what people call a coincidence. But Mrs. Donald is mistaken in telling you that her people did me an injustice. Her father was one of the kindest friends I ever had, and although Mrs. Ellison somewhat misjudged me, and her daughter naturally shared her feeling, they were not in anyway to be blamed for that; for they only thought as ninety-nine people out of a hundred did.\"  \"Whitney, Whitney,\" Mr. Donald muttered to himself. \"I seemed to know the name, though I cannot recall where.  \"Ah!\" he said suddenly, \"of course I remember now, for I was in the court when--\" and he stopped.  \"When I was tried,\" Reuben put in quietly. \"Yes, that was me. I was acquitted, as you know, principally from the way in which Mr. Ellison stood up for me. Thank God that he never, for an instant, believed that I was guilty.\"  \"And to think it should be you!\" Mr. Donald said. \"How strange things turn out! I remember I could not make up my mind about it. It seemed so strange, either way.\"  \"We had better not talk about it now,\" Reuben said quietly. \"I said then, and I say now, that I knew the people who did it and, strange as the circumstances have already been, you may think them stranger still, some day, if I bring one of them before you, alive or dead.\"  At this moment there was a knock at the door, and Mrs. Donald came in and said that one of the constabulary wished to speak to Reuben.  \"Then I will say goodnight. I hope I shall find you getting on nicely, in the morning, Mr. Donald.  \"Will you say goodnight to Miss Ellison and Mrs. Barker for me, Mrs. Donald? And tell Mr. Barker that I shall be ready, in five minutes, to smoke that pipe we talked about with him, outside.\"    Chapter 16: Jim's Report.   \"Jones, what is it?\"  \"Your black has just come, sir. I would not let him come in; for the fact is, he ain't a figure to introduce among ladies.\"  \"What's the matter with him, Jones? Not hurt, I hope?\"  \"He has been knocked about a bit, sir; and he is done up with travelling. The poor fellow can hardly crawl, and was half starved; so I set him to work eating, and came off to fetch you.\"  By this time they had arrived at the door of the shed. Jim was sitting by a fire, eagerly devouring a hunch of cold meat. The men were standing round, waiting till he had appeased his hunger before they asked any question. He looked up and nodded, when Reuben entered.  \"Well, Jim, I am glad to see you back,\" Reuben said heartily. \"I was beginning to be afraid about you. I hope you are not hurt?\"--for the black had a handkerchief tied round his head.  Jim gave a grunt, but continued stuffing great lumps of meat into his mouth. Reuben saw that he must wait till the black's hunger was satisfied, and stood quietly looking on until, having devoured some five pounds of meat, he gave a sigh of contentment, and then took a long draught of rum and water, which Constable Jones handed to him.  \"Jim better now,\" he said.  \"That's right, Jim; now tell us all about it.\"  Jim's story was a long one, and it took more than an hour in the telling; for his English was not always distinct, and it often required much questioning, on Reuben's part, before he could quite make out its meaning. The substance was as follows:  On leaving, some ten days before, on the mission of discovering the haunt of the bush rangers, he knew that it was of no use to go among the wild blacks, their allies; as the hostility against their semi-civilized fellows was so great that he would, at once, have been killed. He resolved to go back to the spot where the track had been obliterated, by that of the flock of sheep; to make a wide circuit, and pick it up beyond and, if possible, follow it until he found them. The difficulties were great, for the bush rangers had spared no pains in hiding their trail; keeping always upon hard, high ground, and at one time getting into the bed of a running stream, and following it for two miles before they again struck for their rendezvous.  However, step by step Jim had tracked them; sometimes losing the trail altogether, sometimes guided merely by a fresh-made scratch on the surface of a stone, or by a broken twig or bruised blade of grass. At last, he traced it far out into the bush, many miles beyond the furthest range of settlements, and then he lost it altogether. There had been a halt, for some time, at this spot.  Beyond this, Jim was entirely at fault. He made circle after circle round the spot, but could find no trace whatever of their passage, and returned to the point where he had missed the trail. He relit the embers of the fire which the bush rangers had made, cooked some food, and laid himself down--first to think it over, then to sleep, for it was now just the close of day.  It was clear to him that here, more than anywhere else, the bush rangers had made a great effort to throw anyone who might be pursuing them off the trail. He had no doubt that the bush rangers had muffled their horses' hoofs with cloth, and had proceeded with the greatest care through the bush, so as to avoid breaking a single twig in their passage; and the only reason for such greater caution could be that it was here, and here only, that they wished to throw the pursuers off the trail. It would have seemed, to a white man, that they had done this before, especially when they had kept in the water course; but to black Jim's perception, it appeared that they had been more careless than would be expected; and that, while apparently doing their utmost to conceal their tracks, they had really left sufficient indications to allow a practised tracker to follow them.  Why then, now that they were far beyond the settlements, and fairly in the country of their native allies, should they, for the first time, so hide their trail that he could not discover it?  The result of Jim's thoughts was that, when he awoke at daybreak, he started back towards the settlements. When he came to the river which the party had passed, in pursuit of the natives, he kept along its bank, scrutinizing the ground with the greatest care. After six miles' walking he suddenly stopped, at a point where the soft turf near the margin was cut up by the passage of the party of horsemen. Here was the confirmation of his ideas.  Arguing the matter out with himself, Jim had arrived at the conclusion that, hitherto, the trail had been a false one, the bush rangers' object being to lead their pursuers to believe that they had gone far out into the native country; whereas, in fact, their hiding place was somewhere among the settlements. Should this be so, the only way to find them was to search for their back track. This he had now found and, with a shout of triumph at his own cleverness, Jim forded the river and followed the track of the horses.  This was now clear enough, the horsemen taking no pains whatever to conceal their traces, feeling perfectly confident that any pursuers must now be thrown off the scent. Jim followed it till sundown, when he had made some thirty miles; and then, withdrawing some little distance from the tracks, he made his fire and camped for the night.  He was now inside the line of the outlying stations, and had approached to the edge of a bit of wild and broken country, which offered so few inducements to settlers that it had been passed by for the better land beyond; although occasionally, when herbage was scarce, the settlers in the neighbourhood drove the animals up to feed among its hills. The black had no doubt that the gang, of which he was in pursuit, had their haunt somewhere in the heart of this wild and little-known tract.  In the morning he again started and, after travelling several miles, entered a narrow valley with very steep sides, with trees and brushwood growing wherever they could get a foothold. He now adopted a careless and indifferent carriage and, although he kept a sharp lookout, no one who saw him would have supposed that he had any particular object in view.  Presently he noticed that the tracks turned sharply off from the line he had followed, in the centre of the valley; and entered the trees, which grew thickly here at the foot of the hills. He made no halt, even for an instant, but walked straight on. Half a mile further he sat down and lit his fire, and began to cook some food. He had no doubt that he was watched for, just after he passed the point where the track turned off, he heard a very low whistle among the trees.  As he sat by the fire, he kept his back towards the direction from which he had come; and when he presently heard footsteps, no change in his attitude betrayed that he was conscious of the fact that persons were approaching him, until two men stopped beside him. Then, with a cry as of sudden alarm, he leapt to his feet.  \"Lor' a mussy!\" he exclaimed, \"de white man frighten me bery much. What for dey no say dey come?\"  \"Who are you, nigger, and where do you come from, and what are you doing here?\"  \"My name Jim,\" he said; \"me going tro' the country looking for place to tend hosses. Me bery good at hosses. Me look arter de hosses ob Mr. Hudson.\"  \"What did you leave him for?\" one of the men asked, sternly.  \"Someting lost from de house,\" Jim said quietly. \"Massa Hudson tink me took it. He make bobbery, so Jim ran away and look for nodder place.\"  \"Um,\" the man said; \"I wonder whether you are speaking the truth? If I thought you weren't, I would put a bullet through your head, in double-quick time.\"  \"No, sah,\" Jim said in great terror; \"dat de truth, sure 'nough. Jim try to get work at Sydney. Couldn't get; so start away, and ask at all de stations. No one want black boy for hosses, so keep on and tink dere more chance out furder. Does massa want a boy for hoss?\"  \"What do you think, Bill?\" the man who had spoken asked his companion. \"Shall we put a bullet in this fellow's head, at once, or make him useful?\"  \"I dussay he is a liar,\" the other replied; \"but then all these black fellows are liars, so that does not make much difference. A black fellow would certainly be useful for the horses, and to look after the fire. We can always shoot him when we have done with him. We shall soon see, by the way he handles the horses, whether he has been accustomed to them.\"  \"All right,\" the other said. \"You come along with us then.\"  \"What wages massa pay?\" Jim asked.  \"Anything you may be worth. Don't you fret about wages.\"  Jim pretended to hold out for a fixed sum; but the man said, in stern tones:  \"Come along, we don't want no more jaw, so you had best hold your tongue.\"  No other words passed till they got back to the trees, and then turned off where the horses had previously done so. Two minutes' walk brought them to a roughly-made shed, built against the almost perpendicular side of the hill. It was built of logs, and there was nothing to show that it was inhabited. No smoke curled up from the chimney. The door and shutters were closed. Anyone who, passing through the valley, had turned among the trees and accidentally come upon it, would have taken it for some hut erected by a wood cutter.  One of the men knocked three times at the door, and it was at once opened. Jim was pushed inside, the men followed him, and the door was shut.  \"Who have you got here?\" a man, sitting by the side of a large fire some distance inside the cottage, asked angrily.  \"It's a nigger who wants work. He says he is accustomed to horses so, as it was the choice between shooting him and bringing him here, we thought we might as well bring him to you. It would be handy to have a fellow to look after the horses, and cut the wood, and make himself useful. If we find he is of no use, there will be no great trouble in getting rid of him.\"  \"That is true enough,\" the other said, \"and I don't think there's much risk about it.  \"Come here, you fellow, and let me look at you.\"  Jim stepped forward towards the fire. He saw now that the hut was built against the entrance to a cave of considerable size. In the centre was a great fire, the smoke of which probably made its way to the surface through crevices in the rock above. Four other men, besides the one who had addressed him, were lying on sheepskins against the wall. There was an opening at the further end of the cave into an inner chamber; and here Jim knew, by an occasional snort or an impatient pawing, the horses were stabled.  The chief of the party asked a few more questions as to where Jim had come from, and how he chanced to be passing through so unfrequented a country. As the black had already decided upon his story, the questions were answered satisfactory enough.  \"I think he's all right,\" the man said, at last. \"At any rate here he is, and he's not likely to go out again. We have been talking of getting a black fellow, for some time; and as here is one ready to hand, we may as well make the best of him.  \"Look you here,\" he went on sternly, to the black; \"you come of your own free will, and here you have got to stop. You will have as much to eat as you can stuff, plenty of rum to drink, and 'bacca to smoke; and if there's anything else you fancy, no doubt you can have it. Only look you, if you put your foot outside that door, unless you are ordered to do so, I will put a bullet through your black brain.\"  \"All right,\" Jim said. \"Plenty eat, plenty drink, plenty smoke; dat suit Jim bery well. He no want to go out of de house, if massa say no.\"  \"That's settled then. Now, put some more logs on that fire.\"  Jim at once assumed his new duty, and the bush rangers, who all hated the slightest work, were soon well satisfied with their new acquisition. There were several carcasses of sheep, hanging from hooks placed in the roof, where they were slowly smoked by the fumes from the wood. A pile of logs were heaped up in one corner, and these had to be cut up into sizes and lengths suitable for the fire. At one end a space was roughly partitioned off, and this was filled with groceries, flour, and cases of wine and spirits which had been taken from waggons going up country.  In the stable were several sacks of oats; and a barrel filled with water, which was drawn from a spring, a short distance from the hut. The first time Jim went into the stable the captain accompanied him, and soon saw, by the black's handling of the horses, that his account was so far accurate, and that he was thoroughly accustomed to stable work.  The cooking was also handed over to him, and the gang passed their time in sleeping, drinking, playing cards, and discussing plans of robbery. For the first few days a sharp watch was kept up on the black, and the men went out themselves to chop wood, or bring in water when it was required. After a few days, however, they relaxed their vigilance, and Jim gradually took these tasks also upon himself.  He was perfectly aware, although he pretended to be unconscious of it, that the first few times he went out one or other of the bush rangers stole quietly after him, and watched him at work; but as nothing suspicious was observed in his conduct, this supervision was gradually given up.  \"It's time to be moving again,\" the leader of the band said, about a week after Jim had joined them. \"We settled the next job should be Donald's station. We know for certain that he generally has money by him, and there will be the watches and trinkets of the women. That fellow Thompson, who worked for them at first, says he has got a first-rate cellar of wine; and that the women were both out-and-outers. If they are as pretty as he says, we will have them here, lads, to do the housekeeping. We want something to liven us up; besides, we shall forget our company manners, if we don't get some ladies to keep us up to the mark a little.\"  There was a burst of coarse laughter.  \"What do you say, boys; shall we start tomorrow? It's a long ride, and we had best leave about noon. We must get into the neighbourhood before dark, so as to give the horses twelve hours' rest before we begin; for we may have to ride for it.  \"It ain't likely. Barker's is the nearest station, and it would be hours before they could get together men enough who would dare to follow us; but still, it's just as well to be prepared, and since that confounded new police officer has been on the station, there's never been no certainty about things. We owe him one for that last affair, which cost Smith, Wilson, and Mulready their lives; but we will pay him out yet. Who would have thought of his being there, just on that very night? I swear, if I ever catch him, I will roast him alive.\"  \"He is no fool,\" one of the others said. \"He gave it those black fellows hot, and no mistake. The sooner he's put out of the way, the better. He's a different sort of chap than the last fellow. I sha'n't feel comfortable till he's got either a spear or a pistol bullet in him.\"  [Illustration: Jim Notes the Bush Rangers' Plans for Mischief.]  Jim, who was squatting in the corner, apparently half asleep, was listening intently to every word. They did not heed his presence in the slightest; for indeed he had, since his arrival, so mixed his talk with native words that the bush rangers had no idea that he could follow their conversations.  He was thinking, now, what was his best course to adopt. In the first place, he had gathered from their talk that this was only one of their hiding places, and that they seldom stayed very long in one neighbourhood. The question, therefore, was whether they would return. It was of no use his going to give the alarm, unless he could return before his escape was suspected; or they would have made off before he could get back again.  As for the Donalds, whose station was to be attacked, it gave him no concern whatever; for the Australian blacks had little or no regard for life, except those of people to whom they were attached. It was Reuben's mission to capture the bush rangers and, had it been necessary, Jim would have remained quiet while a dozen families were slain, until he found an opportunity of bringing the police down upon them.  He listened now, intently, for any word which might afford an index to their intentions. Presently the question he hoped for came.  \"I suppose you will not come back here again, Tom?\"  \"No, I thinks it's getting too hot to hold us, in these parts. We might ride back here, give our horses a rest, and load up with a few things we may want. We can bring two or three spare horses from Donald's. The weather is pleasant now, and we might very well put in a few weeks with the blacks. That last haul we made of traders' goods--cottons, and beads, and trumperies for the gins, and brass rings and such like for the men--will put them in the best of humours. You may be sure there will be a hot chase after us, after this business; and I should propose that we try our luck down south, for a bit.\"  \"I agree with you,\" one of the others said. \"We have had a very good spell here, for the last ten months; and it don't do to tempt luck too long. That losing three of our number, last week, looked as if it was going to turn.\"  \"What's it matter?\" the captain laughed. \"So much the more for us to divide. We have got a goodish bit of brass, now, to say nothing of the goods we have got at each of our places. We can fill up their places easy enough, any time; and those who come in are free to their share of what there is, in the way of grub and goods, but they only share in the brass from the time they join.\"  Jim had heard what he wanted, and he now lay down and thought it out. They were only coming back for a short time. Possibly they might change their minds, and not return at all. It would be a risky thing to depend upon it; besides, his master might be blamed if this attack on the Donalds succeeded.  It would be better, then, to try to get word to him, in time for him to be there before the bush rangers arrived. He himself would return to the hut; so that, if the police arrived too late, he would be able to continue with the bush rangers till some fresh opportunity occurred for bringing his master upon them. It was possible, of course, that one of the men would be left in the hut, in which case he had only to wait.  The next morning the men busied themselves examining and cleaning their arms, and after dinner they went to the inner cave, and led out their horses.  \"Now, look here,\" the leader said to him, \"we are going away, you see.\"  Jim nodded.  \"We come back again tomorrow. I lock this place up, you stop quiet till we come back. If anyone comes and knocks, while we away, don't Jim answer. Let them think place empty.\"  \"All right,\" Jim said shortly, and went and sat down by the fire, as if he had no further interest in their proceedings.  The windows, he had already noticed, had not only shutters outside; but they were firmly closed within, with massive planks, securely nailed and fastened. Jim heard the last of the party go out, and then the door was shut, and the lock turned. Jim heard the party ride off, and then threw himself on the ground and listened, to assure himself that they kept steadily on their way.  The moment he was sure they were gone, he began to search the place for a tool which would fairly suit his purpose. Presently he found a large butcher's knife, with which they cut up the carcasses; and with this he set to work to dig a hole in the ground, close to the wall of the hut. The bottom log was only sunk a few inches in the soil, and in two hours he had burrowed under it, and made his way out beyond; then he crept back again, scraped the earth into the hole again as tightly as he could, crawling out backwards. He then placed a piece of turf over the outside hole, and stamped it down flat.  It was possible that, after he had started, they might change their mind and send one of their number back again; that, however, had to be risked, and at a steady run he set off for the settlements. He did not make for the nearest; for he had gathered, from the talk of the men, that the convict labourers of most of the settlements in the neighbourhood were in league with them.  After three hours' steady running, in which he had covered over twenty miles, he saw a shepherd's cottage and, making for it, gave the man the message which he had taken to Reuben. He had no sooner done so, and had found that the man was willing to set off with it at once, than he turned and retraced his steps to the hut, as rapidly as he had come. It was already dusk when he reached it.  Instead of approaching boldly, he made a circuit and crawled up to it on his belly; and lay for some time, listening intently, with his ear to the door. He felt convinced that no one was there; but to make sure he knocked, and then withdrew among the trees. But all was still and, feeling sure now that the place was untenanted, he removed the piece of turf from the hole and made his way back into the hut again; carefully replacing the piece of turf, and then packing earth under it, so that it would not give way if trodden upon. This, however, was a very unlikely occurrence, as he had made the opening where some bushes screened it from view.  He swept up every scrap of soil from the floor inside, filled up the hole there and trampled it down; and then, after indulging his appetite to the fullest, threw himself down and went to sleep.  When he awoke, a few streaks of light streaming through the cracks of the door showed that it was day; and he made up the fire, and awaited the return of the bush rangers.  It was four or five hours before they returned, and the instant they opened the door and entered, Jim was sure that they had failed; but to his disappointment all were there, and his plan of taking them in a trap had not succeeded. At this he was not surprised; for his own calculations, as to the distance to be traversed, had shown him that it was very questionable whether, even under the most favourable circumstances, Reuben could have got there in time with his men.  Without speaking a word to him, the men led their horses through to the inner cave, and then threw themselves down by the fire. Jim at once proceeded to unsaddle the horses, and rub them down; keeping an ear open, all the time, to what was being said by the bush rangers. Their remarks however were, for a time, confined to terrible curses as to their luck.  \"How did it come about, that's what I want to know?\" the leader said. \"This is the second time that accursed police fellow has turned up, and put a spoke in our wheel. Why, it was not more than half an hour after the first shot was fired before they was down upon us; there must have been pretty nigh twenty of them. How could they have got such a lot of men as that together, if they hadn't known that we were coming? It beats me altogether.\"  \"So it does me!\" was the general exclamation.  \"They seemed regularly to jump out of the ground, just when all was going pleasant. Never knew such a bit of luck--that is, if it was luck, and not done o' purpose--and yet, I don't see as they could have known, possible, as we was going there. Why, we didn't know ourselves till yesterday, not what day it was to be; and except ourselves, and that black fellow, no one could have known it.\"  \"Well, it's certain none of us blabbed; and I don't see as how he could have told anyone.\"  \"Not exactly,\" the leader said, \"considering he's been shut up here, ever since we have been away; besides, I don't believe he knew anything about it. He don't make out half we say to him and, when we are talking together, he minds us no more than if he had been a black monkey; but if he did, it's no odds, he could not have passed through these walls and back again; and if he could, who was he to tell it to? The men round here are all our pals, and would have cut his jaw short with a bullet. But there, it's no use talking about it, he's not been out, and there's an end of it.  \"Still, it beats me altogether. That police fellow seems to know what we are up to, just as well as we do ourselves. I would give all my share of the swag we have made, for the last six months, for a shot at him.\"  \"I don't like it,\" one of the others said, \"I don't; blest if I do; and I says as the sooner we are out of here, the better. After what's happened, I sha'n't feel safe till I am well out in the blacks' country. If he knows what we are going to do, there ain't any reasons why he shouldn't know where we are.\"  \"Why, Johnson,\" his leader sneered, \"you don't really believe the fellow's a sort of conjurer, do you?\"  \"I don't know,\" the man said doggedly. \"After he has turned up twice as he has, I shouldn't be surprised at nothing--not if I heard the sound of him and his men galloping up outside, now.\"  There was a moment's silence, as each involuntarily listened.  \"We are getting to be like a pack of gals,\" the leader said savagely, \"and I agree with you, the sooner we are out of this, the better. As soon as it gets dark, we will be on the move; but I tell you, directly we get out among the blacks, I shall come back again. I am going to carry off that gal, somehow. I've owed her one for years and years, and I always pays my debts--at least, that sort of debt.  \"Now then, you black, just leave them horses for the present, and come and cook us some food; the quicker, the better.\"  Jim hurried about, but in the bush rangers' present state of temper, nothing would satisfy them; and when, in his hurry to satisfy their angry orders, he stumbled and upset a glass of spirits and water he was handing to the captain, the latter caught up a brand from the fire; and struck him so violent a blow on the temple, with the glowing end, that he fell senseless on the ground.  He must have lain there a long time. He was brought to his senses by a bucket of water being dashed over him; and he found, when he staggered to his feet, that the band were preparing to depart. They had already packed up the bales of presents for the blacks, and placed them on the horses. Some of their more valuable belongings were packed away in a secret hiding place, the rest were left to take their chance till they returned; and indeed, except by their friends among the shepherds, there was little probability of anyone paying a visit to the hut, however long their absence might be.  Had it not been that Jim had proved himself a really useful fellow, for the last week, they would have shot him at once and tossed his body in the wood; but they found it so pleasant, having all their work taken off their hands, that after a short discussion they decided to take him with them.  The door was locked, and they started at a trot; but evening was closing in, their horses had already performed two long journeys in the last twenty-four hours, and they soon settled into a walk. They travelled for some hours and, it being then evident that the horses could proceed no further, a halt was called. No fire was lighted, for they were scarcely beyond the settlements and, for aught they could tell, an active search might still be carried on for them.  So anxious were they, that they agreed to keep watch by turns; but when morning broke, it was discovered that the black was missing. The next quarter of an hour was spent in angry recriminations; but as none could say in whose watch he made his escape, their quarrel ceased.  \"It's no use bothering about it,\" the leader said. \"There's one thing, he knows nothing, and can tell nothing against us. He may guess what he likes, but people don't waste time in listening to black fellows' stories. I expect he has only given us the slip because of that lick across the head I gave him, last night. I admit I was a fool to do it, but I wasn't in the best of tempers.  \"However, if the worst comes to the worst, he can only lead them to the hut; and they won't find much worth taking, there. When we once get out to the blacks, we can snap our fingers at them.\"  It was, indeed, about midnight when Jim had stolen away. He was still faint and giddy, and his face was terribly burned by the blow which had been dealt him; but when once fairly away from the bush rangers, he set out in the direction in which he knew the Donalds' station lay; and never halted until he arrived there, on the following evening, utterly wearied and worn out, for he had eaten nothing on the previous day.  \"Then they have got away after all, Jim,\" Reuben said, when he had listened patiently to the long narration. \"You have done all that was possible, Jim. You have done splendidly, my poor fellow, and although we were just too late to catch the bush rangers, we saved the people here; but it is indeed unfortunate that they should have got off.\"  \"Jim knows where dey hab gone,\" the black said. \"Dey hab gone to de country of Bobitu--I heard dem say de name. Jim know dat country well--he come from der.\"  Further question showed that Jim had, indeed, belonged to Bobitu's tribe; and had come with a party of his people down to the settlements, where he was taken ill and left to die, but was picked up and nursed by Mr. Hudson.  \"And you could take us there?\"  Jim nodded.  \"Bery long march, massa. Tree days, with horses. Plenty bad people; much fight.\"  \"I don't care how far it is, or how much fighting we have got to do; I am bound to hunt down that fellow, however far he's gone. I suppose there is no trouble about water. If they can go there, we can.\"  \"Four, six water holes,\" Jim said. \"No trouble about dat--trouble from de black fellow.\"  \"Well, we must risk it, anyhow. We can't start for a day or two. I must send and fetch up all the police, and I daresay some of the colonists will join. The news of this business here has maddened everyone, and as it is not likely that the blacks will give any trouble for some time, and as we know the bush rangers have left for the present, no one need be afraid of leaving their station for a week or two.\"  The next day mounted messengers were sent off in all directions, giving notice that the police would start, in three days' time, for a hunt after the bush rangers; and that there was, this time, every prospect of success, as their hiding place was known.  On the day named, no less than thirty settlers assembled; together with the whole of the police force. All were well armed, and had brought several days' provisions with them. Mr. Donald had made marked progress, and the surgeon had now every hopes of his recovery; but as he could not be moved, and it was just possible the bush ranger might return to carry out his threat, during their absence, two constables were left in the house; and Kate was charged, on no account, to put her foot outside the door.    Chapter 17: In Pursuit.   The last thing before the party started, Reuben went into the house. Mr. Barker was going to remain behind. He was past middle life, and the expedition was likely to be a very toilsome one; and Reuben was glad when he said that he thought six days' severe riding would be rather too much for him, and that he should constitute himself the guardian of the ladies.  \"My wife has arranged to stay here, while you are away; so I shall ride over to my place and see that all is going on straight, every day, and sleep here at night.\"  \"Well, ladies,\" Reuben said, as he entered the room, \"we are just off. So I will say goodbye to you; and I hope that, on my return, I shall find Mr. Donald much better. I am sure that Mr. Ruskin would not have left, this morning, unless he felt that he had quite turned the corner. Pray take care of yourselves, while we are away. You know I don't want to alarm you, but pray be careful. I shall not feel comfortable, as to your safety, till I have that villain safely in my hands.\"  \"Goodbye, Captain Whitney. You know you have all our best wishes,\" Mrs. Barker said. \"We will take care of ourselves, till we hear that you have destroyed the band; and above all, its leader.\"  \"The news that you have done so,\" Mrs. Donald said, \"will do more, I think, for my husband, than anything in the way of doctoring. But take care of yourself, Captain Whitney. I know from what Mr. Barker said that, although you make light of your expedition, it is a dangerous one. He said the police had never ventured so far in the bush, and you may expect sharp fighting with the blacks.\"  \"We may have a brush with them,\" Reuben said lightly; \"but do not be anxious about us. We are a very strong party, and you need have no fear of the result.  \"Goodbye, Miss Ellison; pray be careful till I return.\"  The last words were said in an undertone, as he held her hand.  \"Goodbye, Captain Whitney,\" she said. \"God bless you all, and bring you safely back.\"  Two minutes later, the party rode off. Jim was, like the rest, mounted, as they would travel fast. Four led horses carried provisions; for they would not, as before, find food by the way. It was two o'clock in the day when they started, and they rode thirty miles before they halted, for the night, at a water hole. They had seen no signs of natives during the day, but Reuben at once posted four men as sentries.  It was a merry party round the fire, for all were in high spirits at the prospect of an expedition to a point far beyond that to which any white men, with the exception of fugitives from justice, had penetrated; and they were delighted with the thought of putting a stop, at last, to the operations of the band who had so long been a scourge to the settlement.  Mr. Blount, Dick Caister, and several others who had formed part of the last expedition were of the party; and the confidence which these felt in their young leader, and in the sagacity of his native follower, communicated itself to those who had not formed part of the previous expedition.  \"Must start early,\" Jim said to Reuben, the last thing. \"Long way to water. Ride all day, not get dere before dark.\"  They rode rapidly for some time, after starting, so as to allow the horses to take it easily, during the heat of the day, when there was a halt of three hours; but in the afternoon they quickened their pace again, and men and horses were jaded and done up when, just as the sun was setting, they arrived at their destination.  \"How that black fellow of yours finds his way through this bush is a perfect marvel to me,\" Dick Caister said. \"The country has become more undulating, this afternoon; but the first thirty miles were almost perfectly level, and I could see nothing, whatever, that could serve as an index, except of course the sun. Still, that is only a guide as to the general direction. It must have been nine or ten years since that fellow was here, and yet he led us as straight as if he was making for a church steeple.\"  \"It seems to be a sort of instinct,\" Reuben said, \"although possibly, for the last part of the distance, he may have seen signs of the passage of the natives. As far as I can understand, he tells me at this time of year there is no other water hole, within a long distance; so that naturally there will be many natives making for it. I am glad there are not any of them here, now.  \"Why isn't that horse hobbled like the rest?\" Reuben asked suddenly. \"Whose is it?\"  \"That is the one your black fellow rode, sir,\" Sergeant O'Connor said.  \"Jim, where are you?\" Reuben called, but no reply came.  \"What has become of him, I wonder?\" Reuben said. \"Has anyone seen him, since we rode up?\"  \"He jumped off, the instant we came here,\" one of the policemen replied; \"and said to me, 'Look after captain horse,' and I haven't seen anything of him since.\"  \"There has been somebody here, sir,\" another policeman said, coming up. \"Here's the remains of a fire, behind this bush.\"  \"Yes,\" Mr. Blount said, examining them, and pulling out a brand that was still glowing. \"Do you see, a lot of sand has been thrown over it. Whoever was here must have seen us coming, and tried to extinguish the fire when they caught sight of us.\"  \"That is most unfortunate,\" Reuben said. \"The fellows must have made off, to carry the news of our coming to their friends. However, it's too late to do anything now. It's already getting dark, and they must have got a quarter of an hour's start. We have taken quite enough out of the horses, and can do no more with them, if they have to travel tomorrow; but I would give a year's pay if this hadn't happened.  \"Well, there's nothing to do for it but to light our fires, and camp.\"  The knowledge that they had been seen, and that the news would be carried to those of whom they were in search, acted as a great damper on the spirits of the party; and the camp was much more quiet and subdued than it had been, on the previous evening.  \"All is not quite lost,\" Reuben said when, two hours later, he found that Jim was still absent from the camp. \"I can only account for his stealing away from us, in that manner, by supposing that he must either have caught sight of the natives, or come upon their trail; and at once set off in pursuit. I don't see what it could be, otherwise.\"  \"But if he saw them, why didn't he tell you, Whitney?\" Mr. Blount said. \"Tired as our horses were, they could have got up a gallop for a bit.\"  \"Yes, but for a very short distance,\" Dick Caister put in; \"and as it was getting dusk, if the blacks had had anything like a start, we could not have overtaken them before it had got quite dark. Those blacks can run like the wind. It takes a well-mounted man to overtake them.\"  An hour after the party had lain down, one of the sentries challenged; and the answer which came back, \"All right, me Jim,\" at once brought everyone to their feet.  \"Well, Jim, what is it? Where have you been?\" Reuben asked.  \"Jim hungry.\"  \"That you may be quite sure,\" Dick Caister said, with a laugh. \"Was there ever a native who wasn't hungry; unless he had stuffed himself, half an hour before?\"  \"Yes, I kept some supper for you, Jim,\" Reuben said; \"but before you begin to eat, just tell me if everything is all right.\"  \"Everyting all right,\" Jim said, squatting himself beside the still glowing fire, and beginning to eat.  Reuben knew, by experience, that it was of no use questioning him until he had finished; and he therefore waited patiently, although one or two of the settlers grumbled at being kept waiting for the news. When Jim had finished his meal, he looked round. Reuben knew what he was expecting, and handed him a hornful of rum and water. The black took a draught; and then, without any further delay, began to tell his story.  He had, while still some distance from the halting place, seen a light smoke coming up, and was sure that a party was already there.  \"But why did you not tell us, Jim?\" Reuben interrupted. \"We might have galloped on, and caught them.\"  \"No, sah, no catch dem; horses too tired, black fellow run away, when see white men coming. Dat no do at all. Only one way to do. Let 'em tink dat no one saw dem, else dey run and run, all de way to Bobitu.  \"When get near camp, Jim see dat smoke not come up, know de black fellow see white man and put out um fire. When Jim come here he jump off hoss, find fire, and follow de track. Dey four men; one go one way, one go anoder, two men go straight on. Dey go on to tell Bobitu, de oders go to black fellows in de bush. Jim not care for dem, follow de two.\"  \"But how could you follow them, in the dark?\"  \"Jim were sure de way dey go, dat enough for Jim. He suppose dat dey 'top after a bit; and when dey see de white men all 'top quiet at de water hole, and light fire, dey tink it all right. No make hurry, perhaps 'top and light a fire demselves.  \"So Jim go on quiet for two, tree hour; den at last he see fire, sure 'nough. He crawl up quiet and see two black fellow dar, and hear what 'em say. Dey tired, make long walk today to water hole; say no hurry, white men all go sleep round fire, not go on till sun get up, so dey stop for two, tree hour to rest demselves.  \"Jim get quite close and jump up, den cut off one black fellow head with sword, run sword through de body of other, finish 'em both, and den come back to camp.\"  \"Well done, indeed, Jim!\" Reuben exclaimed, and a chorus of satisfaction rose from all the party at hearing that the men--who, had they reached the bush rangers, would have given the alarm, and so enabled them to make their escape before the expedition arrived--had been killed. The news, however, that two of the party had escaped, and might bring the blacks down upon them before morning, necessitated an increase of precautions.  Reuben at once divided the force into four parties, each consisting of five constables and seven settlers. One party were at once placed on watch, and were to be relieved in two hours' time.  \"I not tink dey come before morning, sah,\" Jim said. \"No water hole near here. Tomorrow plenty black fellow come.\"  \"All right, Jim. We don't care for them, in the daylight; and now that I know the bush rangers won't be alarmed, I don't mind.\"  Jim's prediction proved correct. The night passed off quietly, and the party again started at daylight. The country became more and more broken, as they proceeded. The undulations became hills. Some of these were so steep that all had to dismount, and lead their horses up.  \"Is Bobitu's camp among these hills, Jim?\"  \"Ober toder side, sah. Him place in valley, toder side; bush, plenty game for black fellow.\"  \"How far is it to this valley, Jim?\"  Jim's ideas of figures were but vague, and he could only say that they would get there somewhere about sunset.  \"That would be a bad time to get there, Jim. We must halt, a mile or two this side of them; and you must lead half the party round, so as to cut off their retreat, even if we don't attack them till the morning. On their fresh horses, those fellows will gallop right away from us, if they once get a start.  \"There is no fear, I hope, of any of the other blacks getting there before us, and giving the alarm?\"  Jim shook his head.  \"No. We come straight from water hole. Black fellow go round long way. No fear dey get dere. Dey fight when we go back.\"  \"That's all right. Bobitu's fellows, and the bush rangers, will be quite enough to tackle at once. As for the others, we will make short work of them, if they venture to attack us on the march back. They fight pluckily enough against men on foot, because they know they can make off when they like; but they can't stand a charge of horsemen.\"  Although not so long as the journey on the preceding day, the men were heartily glad when, at about four o'clock in the afternoon, the halt was called, and they heard that the place where the bush rangers were supposed to be was but four miles away. After some consultation, it was decided that Jim should lead half the band--consisting of ten constables under O'Connor, and fifteen colonists--round through the hills, to a position near the mouth of the valley in which the blacks and bush rangers were likely to be; and that, when he had posted them there, he should come back again to their present halting place, and lead forward the party under Reuben.  \"Mind,\" Reuben said, before the others started, \"we don't want to attack the blacks, unless they show fight. Our object is the bush rangers. Jim says that, by what he heard, they have got some sort of houses they have built there. Let us make straight for them. If the blacks attack, drive them off; but we can settle with them, afterwards. The great point is to capture or kill the bush rangers.\"  All agreed to this, for although the blacks gave great trouble, by driving off the sheep and cattle, and sometimes killing the shepherds, there was not the same feeling of hatred entertained for them as for the bush rangers. It was felt to be natural that the natives should resent the occupation of their hunting grounds; and although they were shot down without mercy in fair fight, or if overtaken while carrying off cattle, there was no active feeling of animosity against them; and they were generally kindly treated, when they called unarmed at the stations, and asked for food.  Against the bush rangers, on the other hand, a deadly hatred was felt by the colonists; and the fact that these were constantly aided, by the ticket-of-leave labourers, increased the hostility with which they were regarded.  Jim left his horse behind him, when he started with his party; saying that coming back at night, in the dark, he would rather be without it. After their comrades had set out, those who remained behind posted two men as sentries; and then, as soon as they had cooked and eaten a meal, laid themselves down to sleep, until the time should come for their advance.  It was just midnight when Jim returned. He reported that he had seen no blacks by the way, and that he believed he had posted his party without their being observed. He himself, instead of returning by the same route that he had taken them, had come straight up the valley.  There were, he said, two huts which had been built by the bush rangers; and these were now occupied by them. There were great fires blazing, and he thought that the natives had probably only arrived there that evening. He had got near enough to find that they were in a high state of delight, at the presents which their white friends had brought them.  \"Did you catch sight of any of the bush rangers, Jim?\" Reuben asked.  \"Two ob dem came out and spoke to black fellows at fire, but too far off to see which dey were.\"  An hour before daybreak the party moved forward, and halted within half a mile of the bush rangers' camp. There they stopped, till they could see the sunlight touch the top of the hill at the right-hand side of the valley. This was the signal agreed upon and, mounting, they rode forward at full speed.  Just as they got within sight of the huts, they heard a wild shouting, followed instantly by the crack of rifles. Another minute, and they had reached the scene and joined the other party, who had made straight to the huts. The blacks, awakened suddenly as they were sleeping round the embers of their fires, had hastily thrown a volley of spears, and had darted away among the bushes.  \"Surrender, in the queen's name!\" Reuben shouted, \"and I promise you that you shall be taken down, and have a fair trial.\"  The answer came in the flash of a rifle, from the window of one of the huts; and a constable immediately behind Reuben fell dead, with the ball through his head.  \"Dismount!\" Reuben shouted, \"and break in the doors.\"  With a shout, the men threw themselves from their horses and rushed at the doors of the huts.  \"Sergeant O'Connor,\" Reuben said; \"do you, with six of your men, keep up a fire at the windows. Don't let a man show himself there.  \"Let ten of the others look after the horses. We shall have the blacks back, in no time.\"  So saying, he ran forward and joined those who were battering at the doors. Several of them had brought stout axes with them, and the doors speedily gave way. There was a rush forward.  Mr. Blount fell dead, and Dick Caister's shoulder was broken by a bullet; but there was no check, as the colonists poured into the huts. There was a short sharp fight, but in two minutes it was over. Three of the gang had been shot, as they leapt from the windows. Four more lay dead, or dying, in the huts.  One of them had thrown down his arms, and shouted for mercy. He had been knocked down and stunned, by the butt end of a rifle; but was otherwise unwounded.  Short as was the fight, it had given time to the blacks to rally. Their shouts were ringing in the air, and the spears were flying thickly as the party, having finished their work, rushed outside again, to assist the constables who were guarding the horses.  \"Pour a volley into the bushes,\" Reuben shouted; \"then mount, and charge them.\"  The order was executed and, in a minute, the horsemen were dashing hither and thither among the bushes, shooting down with their pistols the blacks who resisted, or dealing tremendous blows among them with their hunting whips. The charge was irresistible, and in five minutes the main body of the blacks were flying, at full speed, up the steep hillsides.  The victors soon gathered round the huts. Several men and horses had been wounded with spears, but none of the injuries were of a serious character.  \"Well, how about the prisoners?\" Reuben asked the sergeant, who had arrived before him.  \"There's only one prisoner, sir. All the rest are accounted for.\"  \"Is it their captain?\"  \"I don't know, sir. I have never set eyes on him; but if he's a young chap, as they say, it ain't him.\"  \"Jim,\" Reuben said, \"just go round and examine the bodies, and see which of them is the captain.\"  Jim returned in a couple of minutes.  \"None of dem ain't him, sah. He not dere.\"  Reuben started.  \"Are you quite sure, Jim?\"  \"Quite sure, sah.\"  \"Are you sure none of them escaped, sergeant?\"  \"I am quite sure of that, sir. No one came out of either of the doors, and there were only three who tried to bolt through the windows, and we accounted for them all. Perhaps that chap who is prisoner can tell you where to find the captain. It's a bad job, indeed, if he has escaped.\"  \"Is the man recovering his senses?\"  \"Yes, sir, he's just coming round.\"  Reuben stepped into the hut. The escape of Thorne destroyed all the satisfaction which his success would have given him. He had good reason to know the fiendish malignity of the man and, in spite of the warnings he had given Kate Ellison, and his strict orders to the police on guard, he felt a thrill of anxiety, now that he was aware her enemy was still at large.  The prisoner was sitting up, in a corner of the hut; a policeman, with drawn sword, standing near him.  \"Where is your leader?\" Reuben asked sternly. \"The man you call Fothergill.\"  \"He went away yesterday morning,\" the man said, with a grin of satisfaction. \"You haven't caught him yet; and you will hear more of him, before you do.\"  \"Where was he going?\" Reuben demanded.  \"You won't get nothing out of me,\" the fellow said. \"He's been a good mate, and a true, and I ain't going to put you bloodhounds on his scent. He's gone a-wooing, that's where he's gone, and that won't help you much.\"  Reuben at once went outside, and called the settlers round him.  \"I am sorry to say,\" he said, \"that the leader of the party has got away. He rode off yesterday morning, and although the prisoner we have taken did not say where he has gone, I have not the least doubt he has ridden back to the Donalds, to try and carry out his threat to return for Miss Ellison.  \"Therefore, gentlemen, may I ask you to start homeward, at once. The horses have only done a few miles and, if we press forward, we may manage to get to our camp of the evening before last. We have no more to do here, except to see if there are any valuables hidden in the huts, and set fire to them.  \"I expect that we shall have fighting with the blacks, on our way back. Those parties the two fellows who got away went to fetch will, likely enough, bar our way. If it were not for that, I should ride on by myself; but my duty is to stop with my men until, at any rate, we have passed the place where the blacks are likely to attack us. That done, I shall push on. It is annoying, indeed, to think that that fellow must have passed us somewhere on the way, yesterday.\"  The settlers agreed, at once. They all sympathized with Reuben, in his disappointment at the escape of the leader of the bush rangers; and regretted the matter deeply, on their own account. They were, too, now that the work was done, anxious to be off; not only because they wished to return to their stations, but because they felt that their position was a dangerous one. They had penetrated, to a distance hitherto unattempted, into the country of the natives; and they knew that these would gather round them, like hornets, on their return march.  Ten minutes were spent in the search of the huts. The police probed the ground with their swords, and closely examined the walls. They found, under some sheepskins in one corner, a bag containing upwards of two hundred pounds; which was doubtless the amount which the bush rangers had brought back with them, from their last plundering expedition, and had not yet been added to their main store, wherever that might be. This, however, was a welcome find to the police, and they abandoned the idea of searching further; and were about to set fire to the hut, when the prisoner said:  \"Lookee here! I may as well tell you where the lot is hidden. It may do me good, when it comes to the trial; and you may as well have it, as for it to lay there. You dig up the ground in front of that tree, behind the hut, and you will find it.\"  Five minutes later a large leather bag, containing a considerable quantity of gold and notes, and a number of watches, chains, and other trinkets, was brought to light.  \"Don't stop to count the money now,\" Reuben said. \"Fasten it on one of the horses, and let us be off.  \"Sergeant, let Jones ride beside the prisoner, and be responsible for his safety. See that his hands are tied behind him, and his ankles tied securely to stirrup leathers. Let four men take charge of the eight horses of these bush rangers. Do you ride ahead with four others, and keep a sharp lookout as you go. Don't press the horses, but we must go at a smart pace, for we have a long day's march before us. It is fully sixty miles to the water hole where we camped, the night before last.\"  A few minutes later, the party were in motion. Although disappointed at the escape of the leader of the band, they were well satisfied with the result of the expedition, and at the small amount of loss at which it had been accomplished. There was general regret at the death of Mr. Blount; but two lives were considered to be but a small loss, for the capture of so strong a body of bush rangers; who, knowing that they fought with ropes round their neck, always made a desperate resistance.  Half the journey was accomplished without incident, and Reuben felt satisfied that they would, at least, have no trouble with the tribe they had scattered in the morning. The speedy start that they had made had taken them beyond their pursuit; and if attacked, it would be by other tribes.  After an hour's halt, to feed the horses and cook some meat for themselves, the party proceeded again. Another fifteen miles were passed; then Reuben saw the sergeant, with the little party ahead, suddenly draw rein. He galloped forward to them.  \"What is it, sergeant?\"  \"I am pretty sure I saw a black fellow's head, over that rock, sir. It's a nasty piece of ground. I noticed it yesterday, as I came along. It would be the worst place to be attacked in of any we have passed. If the blacks are here in force, they know what they are doing.\"  Reuben examined the position. It was certainly a nasty place to be attacked in. The valley was narrow, and thickly strewn with boulders of all sizes, which had rolled down from the hillsides. Among these the bush grew thickly, and it was only down a narrow path in the centre, formed by a winter stream, now dry, that horsemen could pass.  \"I don't think it would do to make a bolt through that, sir,\" the sergeant said, shaking his head. \"We could only ride two abreast and, if they are strong, we should be riddled with spears before we got through; and there's no charging them, among those stones and bush.\"  \"That is so, sergeant. We shall have to dismount, and drive them out foot by foot. There's nothing else for it.\"  By this time all the party had come up, and Reuben explained to them the situation. All at once agreed that they could do nothing on horseback, on such ground.  The whole party therefore dismounted. The horses were tied to bushes, and the prisoner securely fastened to a tree. Then, rifle in hand, they moved forward.  The sergeant's eye had not deceived him for, as they approached the spot where the boulders and bush grew thickest, a shower of spears was thrown, and the native cry rose shrill in the air. The party were advancing in skirmishing order; and most of them threw themselves down, or dodged behind rocks, as the blacks rose to throw their spears and, a moment later, the rifles cracked out. Several of the blacks fell, and the rest disappeared among the bushes.  \"Make your way forward, steadily and carefully. Let each man watch his neighbour, to the right and left, and keep in line as much as you can.\"  The fight now commenced in earnest, but the settlers and police gradually made their way forward. Not only had they the advantage in weapons; but the fact that they were able to fire while lying down, or stooping, gave them an immense advantage over the blacks; who had to expose themselves when rising to throw their spears, or take aim with their bows.  Several times, emboldened by their superior numbers, the blacks attempted a rush; but the heavy fire from rifle and pistol which greeted them, each time, sent them back in diminished numbers. At last the resistance became feebler, as the natives, seeing that they were being driven out of their shelter, began to slink off; so as not to be exposed to the fire of the white men, in the comparatively open ground beyond. Many, however, were not quick enough, and were shot down as they scaled the steep hillside.  The party of whites gathered, and compared notes. Many had received wounds more or less severe, but none of a nature to prevent them from continuing their journey. They quickly returned to their horses and, mounting, continued their way.  \"There is no fear of any farther attack, I should think, sergeant.\"  \"I should think not, sir. The beggars must have had enough of it. They must have lost from forty to fifty men.\"  Two hours later, the party arrived at the halting place.  \"Now, sergeant,\" Reuben said, \"I shall hand over the command to you; and shall ride on at once, with my boy. I am most anxious about the man who has escaped. I shall take four of the bush rangers' horses. They have not been ridden and, having had three or four days' rest, are comparatively fresh. The fellow has had only one day's start and, if I push straight on, I may be there before him.\"  Reuben briefly bade adieu to his friends, while Jim was transferring the saddles to two of the bush rangers' horses and, leading two others, they started together in darkness. Changing saddles every ten miles, they rode on till past midnight, when they halted; for the horses, accustomed as they were to long journeys, were now completely broken down, and Jim and his master could scarce keep their seats.  \"Too much long,\" Jim said, as he threw himself down, after taking off the saddles and hobbling the horses; \"too much long, sah.\"  \"It is long, Jim,\" Reuben replied. \"People in England would hardly believe horses could go a hundred miles in a day, even if led a part of the distance. Another fifty miles will take us to Donald's. It is about twenty miles to the water hole where we camped, the first night; and that was about thirty miles from the station.\"  \"Shall Jim light a fire, sah?\"  \"No, Jim, it isn't worth while. There is some cold meat in my haversack, if you are hungry; but I am too tired to eat. If there are any natives prowling about, a fire might bring them round on us.\"  \"No tink black fellows near, massa.\"  \"I don't think so either, but I don't want to run the risk, Jim; besides, I am sure neither of us can be trusted to keep watch.\"  Reuben, in spite of his fatigue, was some time before he could get off to sleep. The thought that probably Tom Thorne was, at that time, camped at the water hole twenty miles ahead; and that, in the morning, his horse would be far fresher than those he had ridden, was maddening to him. At one time he thought of getting up, and pursuing his way on foot; but he was stiff in every limb, and felt that the journey was beyond him. Moreover, if the bush ranger had taken some other line, and was not camping there, he would have no means of pursuing his journey.  At the first gleam of daylight they were afoot. The saddles were put on the horses, and they continued their way. Reuben soon found, however, that the five hours he had rested had been insufficient to restore the horses and, even by riding them alternately, he could get them but little beyond a walk.  On arriving at the water hole, the remains of a fire were found. Jim examined the ground carefully, and found the tracks of a horse; and was of opinion that the rider had started three or four hours previously. Reuben carried a large flask of spirits and, having poured what remained in it down the throats of the horses, and given them a drink at the pool, he again pressed on.  Ten miles farther, he arrived at the first outlying station. The owner of this had not joined in the expedition, being a married man, and unwilling to leave his wife in such an exposed position. But upon Reuben's arrival he at once agreed to lend him two fresh horses, and to take care of those which Reuben brought with him.  While the settler was driving them in from the paddock, his wife busied herself in preparing two huge bowls of bread and milk. These were thankfully swallowed by Reuben and Jim and, five minutes later, they started on the fresh horses.  It was indeed a relief, to Reuben's anxiety, to find himself again flying over the ground at a rapid gallop, after the slow and tedious pace at which he had travelled since morning. His spirits rose, and the fears which had oppressed him seemed lifted, as if by magic. He assured himself that he had no cause for anxiety, for that the two constables would assuredly be on the watch, and Kate had promised not to venture beyond the doors of the house until his return.    Chapter 18: Settling Accounts.   Reuben soon checked the speed of his horse. Anxious as he was to arrive as soon as possible, he might, for aught he knew, yet have occasion to try the animal to the utmost; and he therefore reduced the almost racing pace, at which he had started, into an ordinary steady gallop. The horses were fresh and in good condition, and for several miles kept up the pace without flagging. Then they were allowed to ease down into a walk, until they got their wind again; and then started at the pace, half canter, half gallop, which is the usual rate of progression of the colonial horses. They drew rein at last on a slight eminence, from which the Donalds' station, a mile or so distant, could be perceived.  \"Thank God,\" Reuben muttered to himself, \"I am back here, at last. There is no occasion for further hurry;\" and the horses were allowed to go at an easy walk.  \"Man on horseback,\" Jim suddenly said, touching Reuben's arm.  \"Where--where, Jim?\"  \"Gone from de house, sah, trough dem trees. Dare he go again, he gallop fast.\"  Reuben had not caught sight of the figure, but he pressed his spurs against the horse's sides.  \"I will see who it is, at any rate. Jim, do you ride straight on to the house, and say I shall be there in a few minutes.\"  As Reuben rode, at a headlong gallop, towards the point where his course would probably intersect that of the horseman, riding in the direction Jim had pointed out, he turned over rapidly, in his mind, the thought whether his anxiety for Kate Ellison was not making a fool of him. Why should he turn from his course, just at the end of a long journey, to start at full speed on the track of this figure, of which Jim had caught only a glance? It might be a stockman, or someone who had ridden over from one of the neighbouring stations to see how Donald was getting on; but even so, he told himself, no harm was done by his assuring himself of that.  It was not the way Mr. Barker would take to his station. Had it been a neighbour who had come over, he would not be likely to leave again, so early. Neither of the constables would be riding away, in defiance of his orders on no account to stir any distance from the house.  Presently he caught a glimpse of the horseman. He was not more than half a mile away now, but the view he obtained was so instantaneous that he could not distinguish any particulars.  \"He is riding fast, anyhow,\" he said. \"Faster than a man would travel, on ordinary business. He is either a messenger, sent on urgent business; or it is Thorne.\"  He slightly altered the direction of his course, for the speed at which the horseman was travelling must take him ahead of him, at the point where Reuben had calculated upon cutting him off. In a short distance he would get a view of him; for the trees ended here, and the plain was open and unbroken, save by low bush.  When the figure came clear of the trees, he was but a quarter of a mile away; and Reuben gave a start, for he recognized at once the uniform of his own corps. It could only be one of the men left at Donald's and, with an exclamation of anger, Reuben pressed his horse to the utmost in pursuit of the man, who was now almost directly ahead, at the same time uttering a loud call.  The man glanced back but, to Reuben's surprise, instead of stopping waved his hand above his head, and pressed forward. Two miles were traversed before Reuben was beside him.  \"What do you mean, sir?\" he thundered out.  But the man pointed ahead.  \"He has carried off Miss Ellison, sir, and has shot Brown dead. I will tell you, afterwards.  \"There, do you see, sir, over that brow there?\"  At the moment, Reuben saw a figure on horseback rise against the skyline, fully two miles in front.  \"Ride steadily, Smithson,\" he said. \"Keep me in view, and I will keep him. We must overtake him in time, for his horse is carrying double. I shall push on, for I am better mounted than you are; and he may try to double, and throw us off his traces. If anything happens to me don't stop for a moment, but hunt that fellow down to the end.\"  Reuben had been holding his horse somewhat in hand, during the last mile, for he thought there must be some reason for the constable's strange conduct; but he now let him go and, urging him to his full speed, soon left the constable behind. He knew that, for some distance ahead, the country was flat and unbroken; and that the fugitive would have no chance of concealment, whichever way he turned.  Upon reaching the spot where he had seen the bush ranger pass, the wide plain opened before him; and he gave a shout of exultation, as he saw that he had gained considerably. The fugitive, indeed, had evidently not been pressing his horse.  \"He thinks he has a long journey before him,\" Reuben muttered. \"I fancy he's mistaken. He thinks he's only got a constable after him, and that he can easily rid himself of him, whenever he comes up to him. No doubt he learned from some of the convicts that everyone is away, and therefore thinks himself safe from all pursuit, when once he has wiped out Smithson. All the better. I shall overtake him all the sooner.\"  Such indeed was the view of the bush ranger, who kept along at a steady canter, troubling himself very little about the solitary constable whom he believed to be in pursuit of him. When, indeed, on glancing round, he saw that his pursuer was within a quarter of a mile of him, he reined in his horse and, turning, calmly awaited his coming.  Reuben at once checked the speed of his horse. He knew that the man was said to be a deadly shot with his pistol, but he was confident in his own skill; for, with constant and assiduous practice, he had attained a marvellous proficiency with his weapon. But he did not care to give his foe the advantage, which a man sitting on a steady seat possesses, over one in the saddle of a galloping horse. He therefore advanced only at a walk.  The bush ranger put down the change in speed to fear, caused by his resolute attitude, and shouted:  \"Look here, constable. You had best turn your horse's head, and go home again. You know well enough that one constable is no match for me, so you had best rein up before I put a bullet in your head. If you shoot, you are just as likely to kill the young woman here, as you are me; and you know I don't make any mistake.\"  Reuben was already conscious of his disadvantage in this respect, for the bush ranger held the girl on the saddle in front of him, so that her body completely covered his. She was enveloped in a shawl, which covered her head as well as her figure. Her captor held her tightly pressed to him with his left arm, while his right was free to use a pistol.  Reuben checked his horse at a distance of some fifty yards, while he thought over the best course to pursue. As he paused, Thorne, for the first time, noticed that it was an officer with whom he had to deal, and not with the constable; who, as he believed, was the only one in the district. He uttered a savage exclamation, for he felt that this materially altered the conditions of the affair.  \"Oh, it's you, is it?\" he said. \"I thought it was only one of your men; but the advice I gave is as good, for you, as for him. I advise you to turn back, before all my mates are down on you.\"  \"Your mates will never be down on anyone again, Tom Thorne,\" Reuben said sternly. \"We have wiped out seven of them, and the other is a prisoner.\"  \"It's a lie!\" the bush ranger said, furiously. \"They are two hundred miles away, in the bush.\"  \"With your friend Bobitu, eh? Yes, they were, but they are not now, Thorne. They are lying under the ashes of that hut of yours, close to the tree where you buried your treasure; and it's I who am going to have help, not you. My man will be up in a few minutes,\" and he glanced round at the constable, whom the bush ranger now perceived, for the first time, less than half a mile away.  Reuben's words had the effect they were intended to excite. They filled the bush ranger with fury, and desire for vengeance; while the sight of the approaching constable showed him that, unless he took prompt measures, he would have two adversaries to fight at once.  Without a moment's hesitation, he set spurs to his horse and dashed at Reuben. When within twenty yards, he fired.  Reuben felt a sharp pain, as if a hot iron had been passed across his cheek. Thorne uttered a shout of exultation as he saw him start but, as he kept his seat, again raised his hand to fire. In an instant Reuben discharged his pistol, and the bush ranger's weapon dropped from his hand, for Reuben's bullet passed through his wrist.  Throwing the burden before him headlong to the ground, Thorne drew a pistol with his left hand; and the two shots rung out again, at almost the same instant. Reuben, however, was slightly the quickest, and this saved his life. His bullet passed through the bush ranger's body, while Thorne's pistol was diverted somewhat from its aim, and the bullet struck Reuben's left shoulder, instead of his head. In an instant, he had drawn another pistol.  \"Surrender or I fire!\" and then seeing, by the change in the bush ranger's face, and by his collapsing figure, that he was badly hit; he waited, still keeping Thorne covered with the muzzle, for the bush ranger had a charge left in the pistol which he still grasped in his left hand.  Twice Thorne tried to raise it, but in vain. Then he reeled in the saddle, the pistol dropped from his hand, and he fell heavily over on to the ground.  Reuben at once leaped from his horse, and ran to raise Kate Ellison; who lay motionless on the ground, as she had been thrown. Removing the shawl wrapped round her head, he found she was insensible. Kneeling beside her, he raised her head to his shoulder and, a minute later, the constable galloped up.  \"Badly hurt, captain?\" he asked, as he leaped off his horse; for the blood was streaming down Reuben's face, and his left arm hung useless.  \"Nothing to speak of, Smithson. See to Miss Ellison, first. There is some water in my flask in the holster. Just bring it here, and sprinkle her face. I hope she is only stunned; but that scoundrel threw her off with such force, that she may well be badly hurt.\"  \"Is he done for, captain?\" the man asked, glancing at the prostrate figure of the bush ranger, as he proceeded to obey Reuben's instructions; \"because if you ain't certain about it, I had better put a bullet into him. These fellows are very fond of playing 'possum, and then turning the tables upon you.\"  \"There is no fear of that, Smithson. He's hard hit. I hope he's not dead, for I would rather that he were tried for his crimes.\"  It was some time before Kate Ellison opened her eyes. For a moment she looked vaguely round; then, as her eyes fell upon Reuben's face, she uttered a little cry, and raised herself into a sitting position.  \"What is it, Captain Whitney? Are you badly hurt?\"  \"Thank God you have recovered, Miss Ellison. You began to frighten me horribly. I was afraid you were seriously injured.  \"Do not look so alarmed. I can assure you I am not much hurt; only a flesh wound, I fancy, in the cheek, and a broken collarbone.\"  \"And you have saved me again, Captain Whitney?\"  \"Yes, thank God I have had that good fortune,\" Reuben said quietly; \"and this time for good, for Tom Thorne will never molest you again.\"  \"But can't I do something? Your face is bleeding dreadfully. Please let me bind it up;\" and tearing a strip off the bottom of her dress, she proceeded to bandage Reuben's face.  The constable took off the black silk handkerchief which he wore round his neck.  \"I think, miss, this will make a sling for his arm; and when that is done the captain will be pretty right.  \"Do you think you can ride back, sir?\" he asked, when he had fastened the handkerchief, \"or will you wait till I ride back to the farm, and fetch help.\"  \"I can ride back well enough,\" Reuben said, trying to rise to his feet; but he found himself unable to do so.  The ball, after breaking his collarbone, had glanced downwards, and the wound was a more serious one than he had imagined.  \"No, I don't think I can ride back, Smithson.\"  \"There is a light cart at the farm,\" Kate Ellison said. \"Please fetch that. I will stop here, with Captain Whitney, till you come back.\"  \"I think that will be the best way, miss,\" the constable agreed and, mounting, he rode off at once.  It was an hour and a half before he returned, bringing the cart; but before he arrived, Mr. and Mrs. Barker had ridden up on horseback, the former having returned from his visit to the farm, just as the constable rode in. While they had been alone, Reuben had heard from Kate what had taken place.  \"I did as you told me, Captain Whitney, and did not go once outside the door. The constables kept a very sharp lookout, and one of them was always on guard by the door; so there really did not seem any possibility of danger.  \"This morning, as I was washing up the breakfast things with Mrs. Barker, a shot was suddenly fired outside the door and, before I had time to think what it meant, that man rushed in. He caught me by the wrist, and said:  \"'Come along, it's no use your screaming.'  \"Mrs. Barker caught up something and rushed at him, but he knocked her down with the butt end of his pistol. Then he caught up her shawl, which was lying on the chair close by, and threw it right over my head; and then caught me up, and carried me out.  \"I tried to struggle, but he seemed to hold me as if I were in a vice. I heard Alice scream, and then I must have fainted; for the next thing I knew was that I was being carried along on horseback. I was so muffled up, and he held me so tight, that I felt it was no use to struggle; and I made up my mind to lie quite still, as if I was still insensible, till he put me down; and then--I think I intended to try and seize his pistol, or to get hold of a knife, if there was one and, if I could not kill him, to kill myself.  \"There did not seem the least hope of rescue. Mr. Barker was away, and would not be back for hours. I supposed that the constables were shot, and all the men round were away with you; and from the distance you said you were going, I did not think you could be back for days.  \"Presently I felt him stop and turn his horse; and then, when he spoke, I knew that he had not killed both the constables, and that one of them had followed him. When you answered, I thought it was your voice, though it seemed impossible; but I could not be sure, because I could not hear plainly through the shawl. Then the pistols were fired, and I suddenly felt myself falling; and I did not know anything more, till I saw you leaning over me.  \"But where are all the others, and how is it you are here alone? Of course, you must have turned back before you got to where the bush rangers were.\"  \"No, I am glad to say we succeeded with that part of the work, Miss Ellison, and have wiped out the bush rangers altogether. We have got one of them a prisoner, but all the rest of the gang are killed.  \"The distance is not quite so far as we thought it was. It was a thirty miles' march, and two sixties. We attacked them at daybreak, on the third day after leaving.\"  \"But it is only the fourth day today, is it not? At least, it seems so to me.\"  \"It is the fourth day, Miss Ellison. When we found that the leader of the gang was not with them, and I learned from the man we had taken prisoner that he had started to ride back here, twenty-four hours before, I was naturally very anxious about you; knowing, as I did, what desperate actions the man was capable of. So we started at once and, after a sharp fight with the blacks, got down in the evening to the water hole, sixty miles on our way back, where we had camped the second night out.  \"Of course the horse I had ridden could travel no further, but I pushed on with my black boy, on two of the horses which we had taken from the bush rangers, and which had been led so far. We made another forty miles by midnight, and then halted till daybreak, to give the horses rest; but they were so done up, this morning, that we could not get them much beyond a foot pace. When we came to the first settlement we exchanged them for fresh ones, and galloped on; and, thank God, we are just in time.\"  The tears were standing in the girl's eyes, and she laid her hand on his, and said quietly:  \"Thank you. Then you have ridden a hundred and fifty miles since yesterday morning, besides having two fights; and all because you were uneasy about me?\"  \"I had, as you see, good reason to be uneasy, Miss Ellison.\"  At this moment a horse's hoofs were heard approaching, and Jim galloped up. He had, on arriving at the station, been unable to obtain any information as to what had taken place. Mrs. Donald was in a dead faint. Mrs. Barker had, just before he arrived, ridden off to meet her husband; but the dead body of the constable, by the door, and the disappearance of Kate, showed him what had taken place; and he at once started after his master.  His horse, however, was a very inferior one to that ridden by Reuben, and until he met the constable returning, he had been obliged to follow the track of the horses in front; so he did not arrive at the scene of the fray till half an hour after its conclusion. He uttered exclamations of dismay, at seeing his master's condition; for Reuben had been gradually growing faint, and could now scarcely support himself on his elbow.  Jim, however, had taken the precaution to snatch a bottle of spirits from the shelf, before he started; having an eye to his own comforts, as well as to the possibility of its being required. He now knocked off the neck, and poured some into the cup of Reuben's flask, and put it to his lips.  \"Thank you, Jim; that is just what I wanted.\"  \"Massa lie down quiet,\" Jim said. \"No good sit up;\" and, gathering a large bunch of grass, he placed it under Reuben's head; and Reuben lay quiet, in a half dreamy state, until Mr. and Mrs. Barker rode up.  Kate rose to her feet as they approached; but she was so stiff and bruised, with her fall, that she could scarcely move forward to meet Mrs. Barker; and burst into tears, as her friend threw her arms round her.  \"That's right, my poor child,\" Mrs. Barker said. \"A cry will do you good. Thank God, my dear Kate, for your rescue.\"  \"I do indeed, Mrs. Barker. It seems almost a miracle.\"  \"Captain Whitney seems to spring out of the ground, whenever he's wanted. He seems hurt badly. The constable said it was a broken collarbone, but it must be something a good deal worse than that.\"  \"Oh, don't say so, Mrs. Barker, after what he's done for me. If he were to die!\"  \"There, there, don't tremble so, child. We must hope that it is not so bad as that; but he would hardly be looking so bad as he does, for only a broken collarbone. My husband broke his--one day the horse ran away with him, among some trees--and he was up and about again, in a day or two.  \"Is he badly hurt, do you think, John?\" she asked her husband, who was kneeling beside Reuben.  \"I hope not,\" the settler said. \"He ought not to be like this, only from a wound in the collarbone; but of course it may have glanced down, and done some internal mischief. I am inclined to think that it is extreme exhaustion, as much as anything--the reaction after a tremendous nervous excitement.\"  \"He has ridden a hundred and fifty miles, since yesterday morning,\" Kate said, \"and has had two fights, besides this. Directly he knew that the leader of the bush rangers had escaped, he came on by himself.\"  \"Oh! They caught the bush rangers, did they?\" Mr. Barker said, joyfully. \"I was afraid, by his getting back here so soon, that they must have missed them somehow, and found they were on the wrong scent.  \"And he has ridden all the way back, has he? A very zealous officer, Miss Ellison, a very zealous young officer, indeed.\"  But Kate was too anxious, and shaken, to mark the significance of Mr. Barker's tone.  \"Don't tease her,\" his wife said, in a low voice. \"She is terribly upset and shaken, and can hardly stand.  \"Ah! What is that?\"  The interruption was caused by a low groan from the fallen bush ranger.  \"Shoot him dead, sah,\" Jim, who was supporting his master's head, exclaimed. \"Don't let dat fellow come 'live no longer.\"  \"I can't do that, Jim,\" Mr. Barker said, moving towards the fallen man. \"The man is a thorough scoundrel, a murderer, and a robber; but he is harmless now. One cannot wish he should recover, even for his own sake; for there is enough against him to hang him, ten times over. However, we must do what we can for the poor wretch.\"  So saying, he mixed some brandy with a little water in the cup, and poured it between the bush ranger's lips.  \"Is it mortal?\" Mrs. Barker asked, as he rejoined her.  \"I think so,\" he said. \"I fancy he is shot through the lungs.  \"You must really sit down, Miss Ellison. You look as white as a ghost, and we cannot have you on our hands, just now. We have got them pretty full, as they are.  \"Ah! Here comes the cart.\"  The constable had put a quantity of straw in the bottom of the light cart, and Barker and Jim raised Reuben, and laid him in it.  \"We must take the other, too,\" Mr. Barker said. \"The man is alive, and we can't leave him here.\"  \"Yes,\" Kate said; \"he must go, too. He did Reuben a great wrong, years ago. I hope he will confess it, before he dies.\"  Mr. Barker glanced at his wife, as Kate used the young officer's Christian name; but she was not thinking of Captain Whitney of the police, but of the boy Reuben, who had been accused of poisoning her father's dog, and of committing a burglary from his house.  \"You had better get up in front, with the constable, Miss Ellison,\" the settler said, when the two wounded men had been placed in the cart. \"You certainly are not fit to ride.  \"Or, look here, the constable shall take my horse, and I will drive; and then I can look after you, and you can use me for a prop, if you feel weak; but before we start, I must insist on your taking a sip of brandy and water.  \"It is no use your saying no,\" he persisted, as the girl shook her head. \"We shall have you fainting before you get home, if you don't.\"  Kate did as she was ordered. Mr. Barker then helped her up to her seat. As she got up, her eyes fell upon Reuben's face.  \"Oh, Mr. Barker!\" she said. \"He looks dead. You are not deceiving me, are you?\"  \"Bless me, no!\" the settler said, cheerfully. \"My opinion is that he's dead asleep. The loss of blood, the sudden reaction after the long excitement, and the exhaustion of his ride have completely overcome him; and my opinion is that he is sound asleep.  \"Jim, do you lead your master's horse, while the constable takes the other; and then you two had better ride on, and help Mrs. Donald get things ready. Get a bed up at once, for Captain Whitney; and get some clean straw in the outhouse, with one of the rugs over it, for the other.\"  So saying, he touched the horse with the whip, and the cart moved slowly on, with Mrs. Barker riding beside it. She would have gone on ahead, to have assisted in the preparations; but she expected, momentarily, to see Kate faint, and thought it better to remain with her, in case her assistance should be required.  The journey occupied some time, for Mr. Barker picked the way carefully, so as not to jolt the cart. Mrs. Barker endeavoured to keep Kate's attention fixed, by asking her questions as to what she had heard about the expedition, wondering when it would return, and whether any of the settlers were hurt. When they got within half a mile of home, she said:  \"I think, dear, you are looking a little better now. I will ride on. Fortunately there is the beef tea we made, last night, for Mr. Donald. I will get it made hot, and I will get a cup of strong tea ready for you. That will do wonders.\"  When the cart arrived Mrs. Donald ran out and, as Kate descended, clasped her in a long embrace.  \"Come straight in here, my dear,\" Mrs. Barker said. \"I have got a basin of cold water, and a cup of strong tea, and the two together will do marvels. We will attend to your wounded hero.\"  Reuben remained perfectly quiet and inert, as he was lifted out and carried into the house, where a bed had been made up for him in a room on the ground floor.  \"Just lay him down. Throw a blanket over him, and let him lie perfectly quiet.\"  \"Do you think he is really asleep?\" Mrs. Barker asked, as she looked at the quiet face.  \"I do, really,\" her husband replied. \"Put your ear close to his mouth. He is breathing as quietly as a child.  \"And,\" he added, placing his fingers on Reuben's wrist, \"his pulse is a little fast, but regular and quiet. Twenty-four hours of sleep will set him up again, unless I am greatly mistaken. I don't expect that his wound will turn out anything very serious.  \"Let me think. Was it not this afternoon that Ruskin said he would be back again?\"  \"Yes, either yesterday or today.\"  \"That is lucky. He will be surprised at finding two new patients on his hands, now.  \"I will go and have a look at that poor wretch in the shed. Give me a cupful of beef tea. I will pour a spoonful or two between his lips. You had better go and look after Kate. You will not be needed here, at present.  \"If your master wakes, Jim, let us know directly,\" he said to the black, who had seated himself on the ground by the side of Reuben's bed.  \"I can't call the poor fellow away from his master,\" he added to his wife, as he closed the door behind them; \"but I am really anxious to know what has taken place, out in the bush; and whether many of our fellows have been killed. If, as Kate said, she heard the captain tell the bush ranger that all his band had been killed, except one who is a prisoner, it has indeed been a most successful expedition; and we colonists can hardly be sufficiently grateful, to Whitney, for having rid us of these pests. What with that, and the thrashing the blacks have had, we shall be able to sleep quietly for months; which is more than we have done for a long time.\"  Kate came out of the room, with Mrs. Donald, a minute later. The basin of cold water and the tea had had the effect Mrs. Barker predicted. A little colour had returned into her cheeks, and she looked altogether more like herself.  \"How is he?\" Mrs. Donald asked.  \"In my opinion, he's doing capitally, Mrs. Donald. His pulse is quiet and even, and he's breathing as quietly as a child; and I believe he is simply in a state of exhaustion, from which he is not likely to wake till tomorrow morning; and I predict that, in a few days, he will be up and about. Indeed, if that bullet hasn't misbehaved itself, I see no reason why he shouldn't be up tomorrow.\"  \"That is indeed a relief, to us both,\" Mrs. Donald said, while Kate could only clasp her hands in silent thankfulness.  \"And now, how is your husband? I hope he is none the worse, for all this exertion.\"  \"He was terribly agitated, at first,\" Mrs. Donald said. \"I fainted, you know, and he got out of bed to help me up; and it was as much as I could do, when I recovered, to get him to lie down; for he wanted to mount and ride after Kate, although, of course, he is as weak as a child, and even with my help he could scarcely get into bed again.  \"Fortunately Mrs. Barker ran in, before she started on horseback to fetch you, to say that the constable was off in pursuit, and that quieted him. Then I think he was occupied in trying to cheer me, for as soon as he was in bed I broke down and cried; till the constable came back to say that Captain Whitney had overtaken, and shot, the bush ranger.\"  Three hours later, to the great relief of all, the surgeon arrived. He was first taken in to look at Reuben, having been told all the circumstances of the case; and he confirmed Mr. Barker's opinion that he was really in a deep sleep.  \"I would not wake him, on any account,\" he said. \"It is a great effort of nature, and he will, I hope, awake quite himself. Of course, I can't say anything about the wound, till he does.  \"Now for his antagonist.\"  The bush ranger was still unconscious, though occasionally broken words came from his lips. The surgeon examined his wound.  \"He is shot through the lungs,\" he said, \"and is bleeding internally. I do not think that there is the shadow of a chance for him, and no one can wish it otherwise. It will only save the colony the expense of his trial.  \"And now for my original patient.\"  He was some time in Mr. Donald's room and, when he came out, proceeded at once to mix him a soothing draught, from the case of medicines he carried behind the saddle.  \"We must get him off to sleep, if we can,\" he said; \"or we shall have him in a high state of fever, before morning. A man in his state can't go through such excitement as he has done, without paying the penalty.  \"And now, I suppose, I have done,\" he said with a smile, as Mrs. Donald left the room with the medicine.  \"Yes, I think so,\" Mrs. Barker said. \"If you had come an hour earlier, I should have put this young lady under your charge; but I think that the assurance of my husband, that Captain Whitney was doing well, has been a better medicine than you could give her.\"  \"No wonder she is shaken,\" Mr. Ruskin remarked.  \"Mrs. Barker tells me you had a heavy fall, too, Miss Ellison.\"  \"Yes,\" she replied. \"I was stunned for a time but, beyond being stiff and bruised, I am none the worse for it.\"  \"Look here, Miss Ellison,\" the doctor said, after putting his fingers on her wrist, \"I suppose you will want to be about, tomorrow, when our brave army returns. Now, there is nothing you can do here. Mrs. Donald can nurse her husband. The other two require no nursing. Mrs. Barker, I am sure, will take charge of the house; and therefore, seriously, I would ask you to take this draught I am about to mix for you, and to go upstairs and go to bed, and sleep till morning.\"  \"I could not sleep,\" Kate protested.  \"Very well, then, lie quiet without sleeping; and if, in the evening, you find you are restless, you can come down for an hour or two; but I really must insist on your lying down for a bit.  \"Now, Mrs. Barker, will you take this medicine up, and put this young lady to bed.\"  \"I hope she will get off to sleep,\" Mrs. Barker said, when she came downstairs again.  \"I have no doubt whatever about it,\" Mr. Ruskin replied. \"I have given her a very strong sleeping draught, far stronger than I should think of giving, at any other time; but after the tension that the poor girl must have gone through, it would need a strong dose to take effect. I think you will hear nothing more of her, till the morning.\"  Indeed, it was not until the sun was well up, the next morning, that Kate Ellison woke. She could hardly believe that she had slept all night; but the eastern sun, coming in through her window, showed her that she had done so. She still felt bruised and shaken all over, but was otherwise herself again. She dressed hastily, and went downstairs.  \"That's right, my dear,\" Mrs. Barker, who was already busy in the kitchen, said. \"You look bonny, and like yourself.\"  \"How are my brother and Captain Whitney?\" Kate asked.  \"I don't think Mr. Donald is awake, yet,\" Mrs. Barker replied; \"but Captain Whitney has just gone out to the shed, with my husband and the surgeon.\"  \"Gone out to the shed!\" Kate repeated, in astonishment.  \"Yes, my dear. That poor wretch out there is going fast. He recovered consciousness about two hours ago. The constable was sitting up with him. He asked for water, and then lay for some time, quite quiet.  \"Then he said, 'Am I dreaming, or was it Reuben Whitney I fought with?'  \"'Yes, it was Captain Reuben Whitney, our inspector,' the constable replied.  \"For a time he lay quiet again, and then said: 'I want to see him.'  \"The constable told him he was asleep, and couldn't be woke.  \"'Is he badly wounded?' the man asked. 'I know I hit him.'  \"'Not very badly, I hope,' the constable answered.  \"'When he wakes ask him to come to me,' the man said. 'I know I am dying, but I want to see him first. If he can't come, let somebody else come.'  \"The constable came in and roused the doctor, who went out and saw him, and said he might live three or four hours yet.  \"Soon afterwards, just as the sun rose, Jim came out, to say that his master was awake. Mr. Ruskin went in to him and examined his wound, and probed the course of the bullet. It had lodged down just at the bottom of the shoulder bone. I am glad to say he was able to get it out. When he had done, he told his patient what the bush ranger had said; and Captain Whitney insisted upon going out to him.\"  \"It won't do him any harm, will it?\" Kate asked anxiously.  \"No, my dear, or Mr. Ruskin would not have let him go. I saw him as he went out, and shook hands with him and, except that nasty bandage over his face, he looked quite himself again. As I told you, a broken collarbone is a mere nothing and, now we know where the bullet went and have got it out, there is no occasion for the slightest anxiety.  \"Here they come again, so you can judge for yourself.\"  A very few words passed between Reuben and Kate; for Mrs. Barker, who saw how nervous the girl was, at once began to ask him questions about what the bush ranger had said.  \"He has made a confession, Mrs. Barker, which your husband has written down, and Mr. Ruskin and Smithson have signed. It is about a very old story, in which I was concerned when a boy; but it is a great gratification for me to have it cleared up, at last. I was accused of poisoning a dog, belonging to Miss Ellison's father; and was tried for a burglary, committed on the premises, and was acquitted, thanks only to Miss Ellison's influence, exerted on my behalf--  \"I fear,\" he said with a slight smile, \"somewhat illegally.  \"However, the imputation would have rested on me all my life, if it had not been for Thorne's confession. I thought that he did the first affair. I knew that he was concerned in the second, although I could not prove it; but he has now made a full confession, saying that he himself poisoned the dog, and confirming the story I told at the trial.\"  \"Oh, I am glad!\" Kate exclaimed. \"You know, Captain Whitney, that I was sure of your innocence; but I know how you must have longed for it to be proved to the world.  \"What will you do, Mr. Barker, to make it public?\"  \"I shall send a copy of the confession, properly attested, to the magistrates of Lewes; and another copy to the paper which, Captain Whitney tells me, is published there weekly.  \"It is curious,\" he went on, \"that the sight of Whitney should have recalled those past recollections; while, so far as I could see, everything that has happened afterwards, his career of crime and the blood that he has shed, seem altogether forgotten.\"  \"I suppose there is no hope for him?\" Kate asked, in a low voice.  \"He is dying now,\" Mr. Barker said. \"Ruskin is with him. He was fast becoming unconscious when we left him, and Ruskin said that the end was at hand.\"  A quarter of an hour later the surgeon came in, with the news that all was over.  \"Now, Captain Whitney, you must come into your room, and let me bandage up your shoulder properly. I hadn't half time to do it, before.\"  \"But you won't want me to lie in bed, or any nonsense of that sort?\" Reuben asked.  \"I would, if I thought you would obey my orders; but as I see no chance of that, I shall not trouble to give them. Seriously, I do not think there is any necessity for it, providing always that you will keep yourself very quiet. I shall bandage your arm across your chest, so there can be no movement of the shoulder; and when that is done, I think you will be all right.\"  There was only one more question which Reuben had to ask, with regard to the event of the preceding day--why it was that Smithson did not go to his comrade's assistance. He then learned that Thorne rode quietly up to the back of the house and dismounted, then went to the stable, where Smithson was asleep--having been on guard during the night--and pushed a piece of wood under the latch of the door, so that it could not be raised. Having thus securely fastened Smithson in, he had gone to the front of the house, and had apparently shot down the constable there before the latter was aware of his presence.  Smithson, awakened by the shot, tried in vain to get out; and was only released by Mrs. Barker, when she recovered from the effect of the stunning blow which the bush ranger had struck her. He had then mounted at once, and followed in pursuit.  In the afternoon the party returned from the bush, having experienced no further molestation from the natives. Nothing occurred to interfere with the progress of Reuben's wound and, in the course of a fortnight, he was again able to resume his duties.  The complete destruction of the gang of bush rangers, and the energy with which they had been pursued into the very heart of the bush country, made a vast sensation in the colony; and Reuben gained great credit, and instant promotion for his conduct.  A month after the return of the party from the bush, Mr. Donald was about again and, as the danger was now past, he abandoned his idea of selling his property. The course which events took can be judged by the following conversation, between Mrs. Donald and her sister, three months later.  \"Well, Kate, after all he has done for us, of course I have nothing to say against it; and I don't suppose you would mind, if I had. Still, I do think you might have done better.\"  \"I could not have done better,\" Kate said hotly, \"not if I had had the pick of the whole colony.\"  \"Well, not in one way, my dear; for you know that, personally, I like him almost as well as you do. Still, I do think it is a little unfortunate that we ever knew him before.\"  \"And I think it's extremely fortunate,\" Kate said stoutly. \"If it hadn't been that he had known us before, and cared for me--he says worshipped, but that's nonsense--ever since I was a child, he would never have made that terrible ride, and I--\"  \"Oh, don't talk about it, Kate; it's too dreadful even to think of now.  \"Well, my dear, no doubt it's all for the best,\" Alice said philosophically. \"At any rate, you are quite happy, and he is a noble fellow. But I hope, for your sake, that he won't stay in the police. It would be dreadful for you when he was riding about, hunting after bush rangers and blacks; for you know, my dear, there are plenty of others left in the colony.\"  \"I told him so yesterday,\" Kate said shyly. \"I said, of course, that I didn't want to influence him.\"  Alice broke into a laugh.  \"You little goose, as if what you say doesn't influence him.\"  Three weeks later, Reuben received a letter from Mr. Hudson.  \"My dear Whitney, I am glad to hear, from you, that you are engaged to be married; and the circumstances which you tell me of make it a most interesting affair. If I were you, I should cut the constabulary. I enclose a paper from Wilson, giving you three weeks' leave. Come down to Sydney at once, and talk it over with me. You know I regard you as my son, and I am going to have a voice in the matter.\"  Reuben went down to Sydney and, after ascertaining his views, Mr. Hudson went into town and forthwith arranged for the purchase, for him, of a partnership in the chief engineering firm in the town. When he told Captain Wilson what he had done, the latter declared that he had robbed the colony of its best police officer. Reuben protested against the generosity of the old settler, but the latter declared he would have no nonsense on the subject.  \"I am one of the richest men in the colony,\" he said, \"and it's hard if I can't spend my money as I choose.\"  There is little more to tell. Reuben became one of the leading citizens of Sydney and, twenty years afterwards, sold his business and returned to England, and bought an estate not far from Lewes, where he is still living with his wife and family. He was accompanied from Australia by his mother; who, in spite of her strong objections to the sea, went out to live with him, two years after his marriage.  The only point upon which Reuben Whitney and his wife have never been able to come to an absolute agreement is as to which owes most to the other.\n\n"

Lippincott Company. 1902.     A HOUSE-PARTY.     CHAPTER I.   It is an August morning. It is an old English manor-house. There is a breakfast-room hung with old gilded leather of the times of the Stuarts; it has oak furniture of the same period; it has leaded lattices with stained glass in some of their frames, and the motto of the house in old French, \"J'ay bon vouloir,\" emblazoned there with the crest of a heron resting in a crown. Thence, windows open on to a green, quaint, lovely garden, which was laid out by Monsieur Beaumont when he planned the gardens of Hampton Court. There are clipped yew-tree walks and arbors and fantastic forms; there are stone terraces and steps like those of Haddon, and there are peacocks which pace and perch upon them; there are beds full of all the flowers which blossomed in the England of the Stuarts, and birds dart and butterflies pass above them; there are huge old trees, cedars, lime, hornbeam; beyond the gardens there are the woods and grassy lawns of the home park.  The place is called Surrenden Court, and is one of the houses of George, Earl of Usk,--his favorite house in what pastoral people call autumn, and what he calls the shooting season.  Lord Usk is a well-made man of fifty, with a good-looking face, a little spoilt by a permanent expression of irritability and impatience, which is due to the state of his liver; his eyes are good-tempered, his mouth is querulous; nature meant him for a very amiable man, but the dinner-table has interfered with, and in a measure upset, the good intentions of nature: it very often does. Dorothy, his wife, who is by birth a Fitz-Charles, third daughter of the Duke of Derry, is a still pretty woman of thirty-five or -six, inclined to an _embonpoint_ which is the despair of herself and her maids; she has small features, a gay expression, and very intelligent eyes; she does not look at all a great lady, but she can be one when it is necessary. She prefers those merrier moments in life in which it is not necessary. She and Lord Usk, then Lord Surrenden, were greatly in love when they married; sixteen years have gone by since then, and it now seems very odd to each of them that they should ever have been so. They are not, however, bad friends, and have even at the bottom of their hearts a lasting regard for each other. This is saying much, as times go. When they are alone they quarrel considerably; but then they are so seldom alone. They both consider this disputatiousness the inevitable result of their respective relations. They have three sons, very pretty boys and great pickles, and two young and handsome daughters. The eldest son, Lord Surrenden, rejoices in the names of Victor Albert Augustus George, and is generally known as Boom.  They are now at breakfast in the garden-chamber; the china is old Chelsea, the silver is Queen Anne, the roses are old-fashioned Jacqueminots and real cabbage roses. There is a pleasant scent from flowers, coffee, cigarettes, and newly-mown grass. There is a litter of many papers on the floor.  There is yet a fortnight before the shooting begins; Lord Usk feels that those fifteen days will be intolerable; he repents a fit of fright and economy in which he has sold his great Scotch moors and deer-forest to an American capitalist; not having his own lands in Scotland any longer, pride has kept him from accepting any of the many invitations of his friends to go to them there for the Twelfth; but he has a keen dread of the ensuing fifteen days without sport.  His wife has asked her own set; but he hates her set; he does not much like his own; there is only Dulcia Waverley whom he does like, and Lady Waverley will not come till the twentieth. He feels bored, hipped, annoyed; he would like to strangle the American who has bought Achnalorrie. Achnalorrie, having gone irrevocably out of his hands, represents to him for the time being the one absolutely to be desired spot upon earth. Good heavens! he thinks, can he have been such a fool as to sell it?  When he was George Rochfort, a boy of much promise going up to Oxford from Eton, he had a clever brain, a love of classics, and much inclination to scholarly pursuits; but he gradually lost all these tastes little by little, he could not very well have said how; and now he never hardly opens a book, and he has drifted into that odd, English habit of only counting time by the seasons for killing things. There is nothing to kill just now except rabbits, which he scorns, so he falls foul of his wife's list of people she has invited, which is lying, temptingly provocative, of course, on the breakfast-table, scribbled in pencil on a sheet of note-paper.  \"Always the same thing!\" he says, as he glances over it. \"Always the very worst lot you could get together, and there isn't one of the husbands or one of the wives!\"  \"Of course there isn't,\" says Lady Usk, looking up from a Society newspaper which told her that her friends were all where they were not, and fitted all the caps of scandal on to all the wrong heads, and yet from some mysterious reason gave her amusement on account of its very blunders.  \"I do think,\" he continues, \"that nobody on earth ever had such absolutely indecent house-parties as yours!\"  \"You always say these absurd things.\"  \"I don't think they're absurd. Look at your list: everybody asks that he may meet somebody whom he shouldn't meet!\"  \"What nonsense! As if they didn't all meet everywhere every day, and as if it mattered!\"  \"It does matter.\"  He has not been a moral man himself, but at fifty he likes to _faire la morale pour les autres_. When we are compelled to relinquish cakes and ale ourselves, we begin honestly to believe them indigestible for everybody; why should they be sold, or be made, at all?  \"It does matter,\" he repeats. \"Your people are too larky, much too larky. You grow worse every year. You don't care a straw what's said about 'em so long as they please you, and you let 'em carry on till there's the devil to pay.\"  \"They pay him,--I don't; and they like it.\"  \"I know they like it, but I don't choose you should give 'em opportunity for it.\"  \"Oh, nonsense!\"  \"Not nonsense at all. This house is a kind of Agapemone, a sort of Orleans Club.\"  \"You ought not to be bored in it, then.\"  \"One is always bored at one's own place. I tell you I don't like your people. You ask everybody who wants to meet somebody else; and it's never respectable. It's a joke at the clubs. Jack's always saying to his Jill, 'We'll get Lady Usk to ask us together,' and they do. I say it's indecent.\"  \"But, my dear, if Jack sulks without his Jill, and if Jill's in bad form without Jack, one must ask them together. I want people to like me and to enjoy themselves.\"  \"Enjoy themselves! That means flirting till all's blue with somebody you'd hate if you'd married her.\"  \"What does that matter, so long as they're amused?\"  \"What an immoral woman you are, Dolly! To hear you----\"  \"I only mean that I don't think it matters; you know it doesn't matter; everybody's always doing it.\"  \"If you'd only ask some of the women's husbands, some of the men's wives----\"  \"I couldn't do that, dear. I want people to like my house!\"  \"Just as I say--you're so immoral.\"  \"No, I'm not. Nobody ever pays a bill for me, except you.\"  \"Enviable distinction! Pay! I think I do pay! Though why you can't keep within your pin-money----\"  \"Pin-money means money to buy pins. I did buy two diamond pins with it last year, eight hundred guineas each.\"  \"You ought to buy clothes.\"  \"Clothes! What an expression! I can't buy a child's frock even; it all goes in little things, and all my own money too; wedding-presents, christening-presents, churches, orphanages, concerts; and it's all nonsense you're grumbling about my bills to Worth and Elise and Virot; Boom read me a passage out of his Ovid last Easter, in which it describes the quantities of things that the Roman women had to wear and make them look pretty; a great deal more than any of us ever have, and their whole life was spent over their toilets, and then they had tortoise-shell steps to get down from their litters, and their dogs had jewelled collars; and liking to have things nice is nothing new, though you talk as if it were a crime and we'd invented it!\"  Usk laughs a little crossly as she comes to the end of her breathless sentences. \"_Naso Magister eris_,\" he remarks, \"might certainly be inscribed over the chamber doors of all your friends!\"  \"I know you mean something odious. My friends are all charming people.\"  \"I'll tell you what I do mean,--that I don't like the house made a joke of in London; I'll shut it up and go abroad if the thing goes on. If a scandal's begun in town in the season, it always comes down here to carry on; if there are two people fond of each other when they shouldn't be, you always ask 'em down here and make pets of 'em. As you're taking to quoting Ovid, I may as well tell you that in his time the honest women didn't do this sort of thing; they left it to the light-o'-loves under the porticoes.\"  \"I really don't know what I've done that I should be called an honest woman! One would think you were speaking to the housemaids! I wish you'd go and stay in somebody else's house: you always spoil things here.\"  \"Very sorry. I like my own shooting. Three days here, three days there, three days t'other place, and expected to leave the game behind you and to say 'thanks' if your host gives you a few brace to take away with you,--not for me, if I know it, while there's a bird in the covers at my own places.\"  \"I thought you were always bored at home?\"  \"Not when I'm shooting. I don't mind having the house full, either, only I want you to get decenter people in it. Why, look at your list!--they're all paired, like animals in the ark. Here's Lady Arthur for Hugo Mountjoy, here's Iona and Madame de Caillac, here's Mrs. Curzon for Lawrence, here's Dick Wootton and Mrs. Faversham, here's the Duke and Lady Dolgelly, here's old Beaumanoir and Olive Dawlish. I say it's absolutely indecent, when you know how all these people are talked about!\"  \"If one waited for somebody not talked about, one would have an empty house or fill it with old fogies. My dear George, haven't you ever seen that advertisement about matches which will only light on their own boxes? People in love are like those matches. If you ask the matches without the boxes, or the boxes without the matches, you won't get anything out of either.\"  \"Ovid was born too early: he never knew this admirable illustration!\"  \"There's only one thing worse than inviting people without the people they care about; it is to invite them with the people they're tired of: I did that once last year. I asked Madame de Saumur and Gervase together, and then found that they had broken with each other two months before. That is the sort of blunder I do hate to make!\"  \"Well, nothing happened?\"  \"Of course nothing happened. Nobody ever shows anything. But it looks so stupid in _me_: one is always expected to know----\"  \"What an increase to the responsibilities of a hostess! She must know all the ins and outs of her acquaintances' unlawful affections as a Prussian officer knows the French by-roads! How simple an affair it used to be when the Victorian reign was young, and Lord and Lady So-and-So and Mr. and Mrs. Nobody all came to stay for a week in twos and twos as inevitably as we buy fancy pigeons in pairs!\"  \"You pretend to regret those days, but you know you'd be horribly bored if you had always to go out with me.\"  \"Politeness would require me to deny, but truthfulness would compel me to assent.\"  \"Of course it would. You don't want anybody with you who has heard all your best stories a thousand times, and knows what your doctor has told you not to eat; I don't want anybody who has seen how I look when I'm ill, and knows where my false hair is put on. It is quite natural. By the way, Boom says Ovid's ladies had perukes, too, as one of them put her wig on upside down before him, and it chilled his feelings towards her; it would chill most people's. I wonder if they made them well in those days, and what they cost.\"  \"I think you might have invited _some_ of the husbands.\"  \"Oh, dear, no. Why? They're all staying somewhere else.\"  \"And your friends are never jealous, I suppose; at least, never about their husbands?\"  \"An agreeable woman is never jealous of anybody. She hasn't time to be. It is only the women who can't amuse themselves who make that sort of fuss.\"  \"Are you an agreeable woman, my dear?\"  \"I have always been told so, by everybody except yourself.\"  Lord Usk rose and laughed as he lighted a cigar.  \"Well, I won't have any scandal in the house. Mind that.\"  \"You'd better put that up on a placard, as you have put 'No fees allowed to the servants,' up in the hall.\"  \"I'm sure I would with pleasure if I thought anybody would attend to it. I don't like you're set, Dolly. That's the truth. I wish you'd drop nine-tenths of 'em.\"  \"My dear George, I wish you would mind your own business, to use a very vulgar expression. Do I ever say anything when you talk nonsense in the Lords, and when you give your political picnics and shout yourself hoarse to the farmers who go away and vote against your man? Do I ever say anything when you shoot pheasants which cost you a sovereign a head for their corn, and stalk stags which cost you eighty pounds each for their keep, and lose races with horses which cost you ten thousand a year for their breeding and training? Do I ever say anything when you think that people who are hungering for the whole of your land will be either grateful or delighted because you take ten per cent. off their rents? You know I don't. I think you ought to be allowed to ruin yourself and accelerate the revolution in any absurd way which may seem best to you. In return, pray let me manage my own house-parties and choose my own acquaintances. It is not much to ask. What! are you gone away? How exactly like a man, to go away when he gets the worst of the argument!\"  Lord Usk has gone into the gardens in a towering rage. He is a gentleman: he will quarrel with his wife all day long, but he will always stop short of swearing at her, and he feels that if he stays in the room a moment longer he will swear: that allusion to the Scotch stags is too much for humanity (with a liver) to endure. When Achnalorrie is sold to that beastly American, to be twitted with what stags used to cost! Certainly they had cost a great deal, and the keepers had been bores, and the crofters had been nuisances, and there had always been some disease or other among the birds, and he had never cared as much as some men for deer-stalking; but still, as Achnalorrie is irrevocably gone, the thirty-mile drive over the bleak hills, and the ugly house on the stony strathside, and the blinding rains, and the driving snows, and the swelling streams which the horses had to cross as best they could, all seem unspeakably lovely to him and the sole things worth living for: and then his wife has the heartlessness to twit him with the cost of each stag!  \"Women have no feeling,\" he growls, as he walks about the gardens. \"If they think they can make a point they'll make it, let it hurt you how it may.\"  He strolls down between two high yew walls with his hands in his pockets, and feels injured and aggrieved. He ought to be a very happy person; he is still rich despite the troubles of the times, he has fine estates, fair rents, handsome children, and a life of continual change, and yet he is bored and doesn't like anything, and this peaceful, green garden, with its innumerable memories and its delicious, dreamful solitudes, says nothing at all to him. Is it his own fault or the fault of his world? He doesn't know. He supposes it is the fault of his liver. His father was always contented, and jolly as a sand-boy; but then in his father's time there was no grouse-disease, no row about rents, no wire fencing to lame your horses, no Ground Game Bill to corrupt your farmers, no Leaseholder's Bills hanging over your London houses, no corn imported from Arkansas and California, no Joe Chamberlain. When poor Boom's turn comes, how will things be? Joe Chamberlain President, perhaps, and Surrenden cut up into allotment-grounds.  He possesses two other very big places in adjacent counties, Orme Castle and Denton Abbey, but they are ponderous, vast, gorgeous, ceremonious, ugly: he detests both of them. Of Surrenden he is, on the contrary, as fond as he can be of anything except the lost Achnalorrie and a little cosey house that he has at Newmarket where the shadow of Lady Usk has never fallen.  He hears the noise of wheels on gravel. It comes from the other side of the house; it is his brake and his omnibus going down the avenue on their way to the nearest railway-station, four miles off, to meet some of his coming guests there. Well, there'll be nothing seen of them till two o'clock at luncheon. They are all people he hates, or thinks he hates, for that best of all possible reasons, that his wife likes them. Why can't Dulcia Waverley come before the 20th? Lady Waverley always amuses him, and agrees with him. It is so pleasant to be agreed with, only when one's own people do so it makes one almost more angry than when one is contradicted. When his wife agrees with him it leaves him nothing to say. When Dulcia Waverley agrees with him it leaves him with a soothing sense of being sympathized with and appreciated. Dulcia Waverley always tells him that he might have been a great statesman if he had chosen: as he always thinks so himself, the echo of his thoughts is agreeable.  He sits down in one of the clipped-yew-tree arbors to light a new cigar and smoke it peaceably. A peacock goes past him, drawing its beautiful train over the smooth-shaven grass. A mavis is singing on a rose-bough. The babble of a stream hidden under adjacent trees is pleasant on the morning silence. He doesn't notice any of it; he thinks it odiously hot, and what fools they were who clipped a yew-tree into the shape of a periwig, and what a beast of a row that trout-stream makes. Why don't they turn it, and send it farther from the house? He's got no money to do anything, or he would have it done to-morrow.  A peacock begins to scream. The noise of a peacock cannot be said to be melodious or soothing at any time.  \"Why don't you wring that bird's neck?\" he says savagely to a gardener's boy who is gathering up fallen rose-leaves.  The boy gapes and touches his hair, his hat being already on the ground in sign of respect. The peacocks have been at Surrenden ever since Warren Hastings sent the first pair as a present to the Lady Usk of that generation, and they are regarded with a superstitious admiration by all the good Hampshire people who walk in the gardens of Surrenden or visit them on the public day. The Surrenden peacocks are as sacred to the neighborhood and the workpeople as ever was the green ibis in old Egypt.  \"How long will they touch their caps or pull their forelocks to us?\" thinks Lord Usk; \"though I don't see why they can reasonably object to do it as long as we take off our hats to Wales and say 'Sir' to him.\"  This political problem suggests the coming elections to his mind: the coming elections are a disagreeable subject for meditation: why wasn't he born in his grandfather's time, when there were pocket boroughs as handy and portable as snuff-boxes, and the county returned Lord Usk's nominee as a matter of course without question?  \"Well, and what good men they got in those days,\" he thinks, \"Fox, and Hervey, and Walpole, and Burke, and all the rest of 'em; fine orators, clever ministers, members that did the nation honor; every great noble sent up some fine fellow with breeding and brains; bunkum and bad logic and dropped aspirates had no kind of chance to get into the House in those days. Now, even when Boom's old enough to put up himself, I dare say there'll be some biscuit-baker or some pin-maker sent down by the Radical Caucus or the English Land League who'll make the poor devils believe that the millennium's coming in with them, and leave Boom nowhere!\"  The prospect is so shocking that he throws his cigar-end at the peacocks and gets up out of the evergreen periwig.  As he does so he comes, to his absolute amazement, face to face with his friend Lord Brandolin.  Lord Brandolin is supposed by all the world, or at least that large portion of it which is interested in his movements, to be at that moment in the forest-recesses of Lahore.  \"My dear George,\" says Lord Brandolin, in a very sweet voice, wholly unlike the peacocks', \"I venture to take you by surprise. I have left my tub at Weymouth and come on foot across-country to you. It is most unpardonable conduct, but I have always abused your friendship.\"  The master of Surrenden cannot find words of welcome warm enough to satisfy himself. He is honestly delighted. Failing Dulcia Waverley, nobody could have been so agreeable to him as Brandolin. For once a proverb is justified, \"a self-invited guest is thrice welcome.\" He is for dragging his visitor in at once to breakfast, but Brandolin resists. He has breakfasted on board his yacht; he could not eat again before luncheon; he likes the open air, he wishes to sit in the periwig and smoke.  \"Do not let us disturb Lady Usk,\" he said. \"I know chtelaines in the country have a thousand and one things to do before luncheon, and I know your house is full from gable to cellar.\"  \"It will be by night,\" says the master of Surrenden, with disgust, \"and not a decent soul among 'em all.\"  \"That is very sad for you,\" says Brandolin, with a twinkle in his handsome eyes. He is not a handsome man, but he has beautiful eyes, a patrician profile, and a look of extreme distinction; his expression is a little cynical, but more amused; he is about forty years old, but looks younger. He is not married, having by some miracle of good fortune, or of personal dexterity, contrived to elude all the efforts made for his capture. His barony is one of the oldest in England, and he would not exchange it, were it possible, for a dukedom.  \"Since when have you been so in love with decency, George?\" he asks, gravely.  Lord Usk laughs. \"Well, you know I think one's own house should be proper.\"  \"No doubt,\" says Lord Brandolin, still more gravely. \"To do one's morality vicariously is always so agreeable. Is Lady Waverley not here? She would save a hundred Sodoms, with a dozen Gomorrahs thrown in gratis.\"  \"I thought you were in India,\" says his host, who does not care to pursue the subject of Lady Waverley's saintly qualifications for the salvation of cities or men.  \"I went to India, but it bored me. I liked it when I was twenty-four; one likes so many things when one is twenty-four,--even champagne and a cotillion. How's Boom?\"  \"Very well; gone to his cousins' in Suffolk. Sure you won't have something to eat? They can bring it here in a minute if you like out-of-doors best.\"  \"Quite sure, thanks. What a lovely place this is! I haven't seen it for years. I don't think there's another garden so beautiful in all England. After the great dust-plains and the sweltering humid heats of India, all this coolness and greenness are like Paradise.\"  Brandolin laughs languidly.  \"Hot! you ungrateful, untravelled country squire! I should like to fasten you to a life-buoy in the middle of the Red Sea. Why do Englishmen perspire in every pore the moment the thermometer's above zero in their own land, and yet stand the tropics better than any other Europeans?\"  \"You know I've sold Achnalorrie?\" says his host, _ propos de rien_, but to him Achnalorrie seems _ propos_ of everything in creation.  Brandolin is surprised, but he does not show any surprise. \"Ah! Quite right, too. If we wished to please the Radicals we couldn't find any way to please them and injure ourselves equal to our insane fashion of keeping hundreds of square acres at an enormous cost, only that for a few weeks in the summer we may do to death some of the most innocent and graceful of God's creatures.\"  \"That's just the bosh Dolly talks.\"  \"Lady Usk is a wise politician, then. Let her train Boom for his political life. I don't know which is the more utterly indefensible,--our enormous Highland deer-slaughter or our imbecile butchery of birds. They ought to have recorded the introduction of battue-shooting into the British Isles by the Great and Good on the Albert Memorial.\"  \"One must shoot something.\"  \"I never saw why. But 'something' honestly found by a setter in stubble, and three thousand head of game between five guns in a morning, are very different things. What did they give you for Achnalorrie?\"  Usk discourses of Achnalorrie with breathless eloquence, as of a lover eulogizing the charms of a mistress forever lost to him.  Brandolin listens with admirable patience, and affects to agree that the vision of the American crawling on his stomach over soaking heather in a thick fog for eight hours after a \"stag of ten\" is a vision of such unspeakably enviable bliss that it must harrow the innermost soul of the dispossessed lord of the soil.  \"And yet, do you know,\" he says, in conclusion, \"I am such a degenerate mortal, such an unworthy 'son of a gun,' that I would actually sooner be sitting in these lovely, sunny, shady gardens, where one expects to see all Spenser's knights coming through the green shadows towards one, than I would be the buyer of Achnalorrie, even in the third week of August?\"  \"You say so, but you don't mean it,\" says the seller of Achnalorrie.  \"I never say what I don't mean,\" says Brandolin. \"And I never cared about Scotland.\"  The other smokes dejectedly, and refuses to be comforted.  \"Lady Waverley isn't here?\" asks Brandolin, with a certain significance. Lady Waverley alone would have the power of making the torturing vision of the American among the heather fade into the background of her host's reflections.     CHAPTER II.   \"Dolly is nasty about Achnalorrie,\" says Lord Usk, as they at last rise and approach the house.  \"Not logical if she objects to moors on political principles. But ladies are seldom logical when they are as charming as Lady Usk.\"  \"She never likes me to enjoy anything.\"  \"I don't think you are quite just to her: you know I always tell you so.\" (Brandolin remembers the sweetness with which Dorothy Usk invites Lady Waverley season after season.) \"You are a great grumbler, George. I know grumbling is a Briton's privilege, provided for and secured to him in Magna Charta; but still too great abuse of the privilege spoils life.\"  \"Nobody was ever so bothered as I am.\" Lord Usk regards himself invariably with compassion as an ill-used man. \"You always take everything lightly; but then you aren't married, and I suppose you get _some_ of your rents?\"  \"I have always been rather poor, but I don't mind it. So long as I needn't shut up or let the old place, and can keep my boat afloat, I don't much care about anything more. I've enough for myself.\"  \"Ah, that's just it; but when one has no end of family expenses and four great houses to keep up, and the counties looking to one for everything, and the farmers, poor devils, ruined themselves, it's another matter. I assure you if I hadn't made that sacrifice of Achnalorrie----\"  Lady Usk coming out of the garden-room down the steps of one of the low windows spares Brandolin the continuation of the lament. She looks pretty; mindful of her years, she holds a rose-lined sun-umbrella over her head; the lace and muslin of her breakfast-gown sweep the lawn softly; she has her two daughters with her, the Ladies Alexandra and Hermione, known as Dodo and Lilie. She welcomes Brandolin with mixed feelings, though with unmixed suavity. She is glad to see him because he amuses Usk, and is a person of wit and distinction whom everybody tries to draw to their houses; but then he upsets all her nicely-balanced combinations; there is nobody for him; he will be the \"one out\" when all her people so nicely arranged and paired; and, as she is aware that he is not a person to be reconciled to such isolation, he will dispossess somebody else and cause probably those very dissensions and complications from which it is always her effort to keep all her house-parties free. However, there he is; and he is accustomed to be welcomed and made much of wherever he goes. She can do no less.  Brandolin makes himself charming in return, and turns pretty compliments to her and the children, which he can do honestly, for he has always liked Dorothy Usk, and the two young girls are as agreeable objects of contemplation as youth, good looks, fair skins, pretty frocks, open air, much exercise, and an indescribable air of \"breeding\" can make them. An English patrician child is one of the prettiest and most wholesome things on the face of the earth.  He goes to play lawn tennis with them and their youngest brother Cecil, called the Babe; and Lady Usk, under her rose-lined umbrella, sits as umpire, while her lord saunters off disconsolately to an interview with his steward. In these times those interviews are of an unbroken melancholy, and always result in producing the conviction in his mind that Great Britain cannot possibly last out another year. Without the nobility and gentry what will she be? and they will all go to the lands they've bought in America, if they're in luck, and if they aren't will have to turn shoeblacks.  \"But the new electorate won't have its shoes blacked,--won't even have any shoes to black,\" suggests Mr. Lanyon, the land-steward, who began life as an oppidan at Eton and captain of an Eight, but has been glad to take refuge from the storm on the estates of his old Eton comrade, a trust which he discharges with as much zeal as discretion, dwelling contentedly in a rose-covered grange on the edge of the home-woods of Surrenden. If Boom finds things at all in order when he comes into possession, it will be wholly due to John Lanyon.  In one of the pauses of their game the tennis-players hear the brake and the omnibus returning. None of those whom they bring will be visible until luncheon at two o'clock.  \"Have you anybody very nice, Lady Usk?\" asks Brandolin of his hostess.  She hesitates; there are some women that he would call nice, but then they each have their man. \"I hardly know,\" she answers, vaguely. \"You don't like many people, if I remember----\"  \"All ladies, surely,\" says Brandolin, with due gravity.  \"I'm sure you don't like Grandma Sophy,\" says the saucy Babe, sitting cross-legged in front of him. He means the Dowager Duchess of Derry, a very unpleasant person of strong principles, called by the profane \"Sophia, by the grace of God,\" because she ruled Ireland in a viceroyalty of short duration and long-enduring mischief. She and Brandolin do not agree, a fact which the Babe has seen and noted with the all-seeing eyes of a petted boy who is too much in his mother's drawing-rooms.  \"I plead guilty to having offended her Grace Sophia,\" says Brandolin, \"but I conclude that Lady Usk's guests are not all like that most admirable lady.\"  The Babe and his sisters laugh with much irreverent enjoyment; her Grace is not more appreciated by her grandchildren than she was by Ireland.  \"If I had known you were going to be so kind as to remember us, I would have invited some of your friends,\" says his hostess, without coming to the rescue of her august mother's name. \"I am so sorry; but there is nobody I think who will be very sympathetic to you. Besides, you know them all already.\"  \"And is that fatal to sympathy? What a cruel suggestion, dear Lady Usk!\"  \"Sympathy is best new, like a glove. It fits best; you don't see any wrinkles in it for the first hour.\"  \"What cynicism! Do you know that I am very fond of old gloves? But, then, I never was a dandy----\"  \"Lord Brandolin will like Madame Sabaroff,\" says Dodo, a very _veill_ young lady of thirteen.  \"Fair prophetess, why? And who is Madame Sabaroff? A second O. K., a female Stepniak?\"  \"What are those?\" says Dodo. \"She is very handsome, and a princess in her own right.\"  \"She gave me two Ukraine ponies and a real droschky,\" says the Babe.  \"And Boom a Circassian mare, all white, and each of us a set of Siberian turquoises,\" says Lilie.  \"Her virtues must be as many as her charms,\" says Brandolin.  \"She is a lovely creature,\" adds Lady Usk, \"but I don't think she is your style at all; you like fast women who make you laugh.\"  \"My tastes are catholic where your adorable sex is in question,\" says Brandolin. \"I am not sure that I do like fast women; they are painful to one's vanity; they flirt with everybody.\"  Lady Usk smiles. \"The season before last, I recollect----\"  \"Dearest lady, don't revert to pre-historic times. Nothing is so disagreeable as to think this year of what we liked last year.\"  \"It was Lady Leamington last year!\" cries the terrible Babe.  Brandolin topples him over on the grass and hoists him up on his own shoulders. \"You precocious rascal! What will you be when you are twenty?\"  \"Babe's future is a thing of horror to contemplate,\" says his mother, smiling placidly.  \"Who is Madame Sabaroff?\" asks Brandolin, again, with a vague curiosity.  \"A princess in her own right; a god-daughter of the Emperor's,\" says Dodo. \"She is so handsome, and her jewels--you never saw such jewels.\"  \"Her father was Chancellor,\" adds her mother, \"and her husband held some very high place at court, I forget what.\"  \"Held? Is he disgraced, then, or dead?\"  \"Oh, dead: that is what is so nice for her,\" says Dodo.  \"Heartless Dodo!\" says Brandolin. \"Then if I marry you four years hence I must kill myself to become endeared to you?\"  \"I should pity you indeed if you were to marry Dodo,\" says Dodo's mother. \"She has not a grain of any human feeling, except for her dog.\"  Dodo laughs. She likes to be called heartless; she thinks it is _chic_ and grown-up; she will weep over a lame puppy, a beaten horse, a dead bird, but she is \"hard as nails to humans,\" as her brother Boom phrases it.  \"Somebody will reign some day where the Skye reigns now over Dodo's soul. Happy somebody!\" says Brandolin. \"I shall be too old to be that somebody. Besides, Dodo will demand from fate an Adonis and a Cr[oe]sus in one!\"  Dodo smiles, showing her pretty white teeth; she likes the banter and the flirtation with some of her father's friends. She feels quite old; in four years' time her mother will present her, and she means to marry directly after that.  \"When does this Russian goddess who drops ponies and turquoises out of the clouds arrive here?\" asks Brandolin, as he picks up his racquet to resume the game.  \"She won't be here for three days,\" says Lady Usk.  \"Then I fear I shall not see her.\"  \"Oh, nonsense! You must stay all the month, at least.\"  \"You are too good, but I have so many engagements.\"  \"Engagements are made to be broken. I am sure George will not let you go.\"  \"We won't let you go,\" cries the Babe, dragging him off to the nets, \"and I'll drive you this afternoon, behind my ponies.\"  \"I have gone through most perils that can confront a man, Babe, and I shall be equal even to that,\" says Brandolin.  He is a great favorite with the children at Surrenden, where he has always passed some weeks of most years ever since they can remember, or he either, for he was a godson and ward of the late Lord Usk, and always welcome there. His parents died in his infancy: even a long minority failed to make him a rich man. He has, however, as he had said, enough for his not extravagant desires, and is able to keep his old estate of St. Hubert's Lea, in Warwickshire, unembarrassed. His chief pleasure has been travelling and sailing, and he has travelled and sailed wherever a horse or a dromedary, a schooner or a canoe, can penetrate. He has told some of his travels in books so admirably written that, _mirabile dictu_! they please both learned people and lazy people. They have earned him a reputation beyond the drawing-rooms and clubs of his own fashionable acquaintances. He has even considerable learning himself, although he carries it so lightly that few people suspect it. He has had a great many passions in his life, but they have none of them made any very profound impression on him. When any one of them has grown tiresome or seemed likely to enchain him more than he thought desirable, he has always gone to Central Asia or the South Pole. The butterflies which he has broken on his wheel have, however, been of that order which is not crushed by abandonment, but mends itself easily and soars to new spheres. He is incapable of harshness to either man or woman, and his character has a warmth, a gayety, and a sincerity in it which endear him inexpressibly to all his friends. His friendships have hitherto been deeper and more enduring than his amours. He is, on the whole, happy,--as happy as any thinking being can be in this world of anomalies and purposeless pains.  \"But then you always digest all you eat,\" Usk remarks to him, enviously.  \"Put it the other way and be nearer the point,\" says Brandolin. \"I always eat what I can digest, and I always leave off with an appetite.\"  \"I should be content if I could begin with one,\" says Usk.  Brandolin is indeed singularly abstemious in the pleasures of the table, to which the good condition of his nerves and constitution may no doubt be attributed. \"I have found that eating is an almost entirely unnecessary indulgence,\" he says in one of his books. \"If an Arab can ride, fight, kill lions, and slay Frenchmen on a mere handful of pulse or of rice, why cannot we live on it too?\" Whereat Usk wrote once on the margin of the volume, in pencil, \"Why should we?\"  The author, seeing this one day, wrote also on the margin, \"For the best of all reasons: to do away with dyspepsia and with doctors, who keep their carriages on our indigestion and make fifty thousand a year each out of it.\"  Usk allowed that the reason was excellent; but then the renunciation involved was too enormous.     CHAPTER III.   Let it not for an instant be supposed that the guests of Surrenden are people looked in the least coldly or shyly on by society. Not they. They go to drawing-rooms, which means nothing; they are invited to state balls and state concerts, which means much. They are among the most eminent leaders of that world of fashion which has of late revolutionized taste, temper, and society in England. Mrs. Wentworth Curzon sails a little near the wind, perhaps because she is careless, and now and then Lady Dawlish has been \"talked about,\" because she has a vast number of debts and a lord who occasionally makes scenes; but, with these exceptions, all these ladies are as safe on their pedestals as if they were marble statues of chastity. That their tastes are studied and their men asked to meet them everywhere is only a matter of delicate attention, like the bouquets which the housekeeper sets out in their bedrooms and the new novels which are laid on their writing-tables.  \"I like my house to be pleasant,\" says Dorothy Usk, and she does not look any further than that: as for people's affairs, she is not supposed to know anything about them. She knows well enough that Iona would not come to her unless she had asked the Marquise de Caillac, and she is fully aware that Lawrence Hamilton would never bestow the cachet of his illustrious presence on Surrenden unless Mrs. Wentworth Curzon brought thither her _fourgons_, her maids, her collie dog, her famous emeralds, and her no less famous fans. Of course she knows that, but she is not supposed to know it. Nobody except her husband would be so ill-bred as to suggest that she did know it; and if any of her people should ever by any mischance forget their tact and stumble into the newspapers, or become notorious by any other accident, she will drop them, and nobody will be more surprised at the discovery of their naughtiness than herself. Yet she is a kind woman, a virtuous woman, a very warm friend, and not more insincere in her friendships than any one else; she is only a hostess of the last lustre of the nineteenth century, a woman who knows her London and follows it in all its amazing and illimitable condonations as in its eccentric and exceptional severities.  The guests are numerous; they might even he said to be miscellaneous, were it not that they all belonged to the same set. There is Dick Wootton, who believes himself destined to play in the last years of the nineteenth century the part played by Charles Greville in the earlier. There is Lord Vanstone, an agreeable, eccentric, unsatisfactory valetudinarian, who ought to have done great things with his life, but has always been too indolent and had too bad health to carry out his friends' very large expectations of him. There is the young Duke of Whitby, good-natured and foolish, with a simple pleasant face and a very shy manner. \"If I had that ass's opportunities I'd make the world spin,\" says Wriothesley Ormond, who is a very poor and very witty member of Parliament, and also, which he values more, the most popular member of the Marlborough. There is Lord Iona, very handsome, very silent, very much sought after and spoilt by women. There is Hugo Mountjoy, a pretty young fellow in the Guards, with a big fortune and vague ideas that he ought to \"do something;\" he is not sure what. There is Lawrence Hamilton, who, as far as is possible in an age when men are clothed, but do not dress, gives the law to St. James Street in matters of male toilet. There is Sir Adolphus Beaumanoir, an ex-diplomatist, admirably preserved, charmingly loquacious, and an unconscionable flirt, though he is seventy. Each of these happy or unhappy beings has the lady invited to meet him in whom his affections are supposed to be centred, for the time being, in those tacit but potent relations which form so large a portion of men's and women's lives in these days. It is this condonance on the part of his wife which George Usk so entirely denounces, although he would be very much astonished and very much annoyed if she made any kind of objections to inviting Dulcia Waverley. Happily, there is no Act of Parliament to compel any of us to be consistent, or where would anybody be?  Lady Dolgelly, much older than himself, and with a _taille de couturire_, as all her intimate friends delight to reveal, is supposed to be indispensable to the existence of His Grace of Whitby; Lady Leamington is not less necessary to the happiness of Wriothesley Ormond. Mr. Wootton would be supposed incapable of cutting a single joke or telling a single good story unless his spirits were sustained by the presence of Mrs. Faversham, the prettiest brunette in the universe, for whom Worth is supposed to make marvellous combinations of rose and gold, of amber and violet, of deep orange and black, and of a wondrous yellow like that of the daffodil, which no one dares to wear but herself. Mrs. Wentworth Curzon is the momentary goddess of Lawrence Hamilton; and Lord Iona, as far as he has ever opened his handsome mouth to say anything \"serious,\" has sworn himself the slave of Madame de Caillac. Sir Adolphus has spread the gis of his semi-paternal affection over the light little head of that extravagant little beauty, Lady Dawlish; whilst Hugo Mountjoy is similarly protected by the prescient wisdom and the rare experience of his kindest of friends, Lady Arthur Audley.  Sir Hugo and several other gilded youths there present are all exact patterns of one another, the typical young Englishman of the last years of this curious century; the masher pure and simple; close-shaven, close-cropped, faultlessly clothed, small of person, small of features, stiff, pale, insignificant, polite, supercilious, indifferent; occasionally amusing, but never by any chance original; much concerned as to health, climate, and their own nerves; often talking of their physicians, and flitting southward before cold weather like swallows, though they have nothing whatever definite the matter with them.  These young men are all convinced that England is on the brink of ruin, and they talk of it in the same tone with which they say that their cigarette is out, or the wind is in the east. The Throne, the Church, the Lords, and the Thirty-Nine Articles are all going down pell-mell next week, and it is very shocking; nevertheless, there is no reason why they should not be studious of their digestions and very anxious about the parting of their hair.  It never occurs to them that they and their father's battue-shooting, pigeon-shooting, absenteeism, clubism, and general preference for every country except their own, may have had something to do with bringing about this impending cataclysm. That all the grand old houses standing empty, or let to strangers, among the rich Herefordshire pastures, the green Warwickshire woods, the red Devon uplands, the wild Westmoreland fells, may have also something to do with it, never occurs to them. That while they are flirting at Aix, wintering at Pau, throwing comfits at Rome, losing on the red at Monaco, touring in California, or yawning in Berlin, the demagogue's agents are whispering to the smock-frocks in the meadows, and pouring the gall of greed and hatred into the amber ale of the village pothouse, never occurs to them. If any one suggests it, they stare: \"such a beastly climate, you know; nobody can stand it. Live in the country? Oh, Lord! who could live in the country?\"  And then they wonder that Mr. George has replaced Sir Roger de Coverley, and that Joseph Chamberlain's voice is heard instead of Edmund Burke's.  Their host could kick them with a sensation of considerable satisfaction. Their neatness, smallness, and self-complacency irritate him excessively. The bloods of George the Fourth's time at least were men,--so he says.  \"You do these poor boys injustice,\" says Brandolin. \"When they get out in a desert, or are left to roast and die under the equator, they put off all their affectations with their starched cambric, and are not altogether unworthy of their great-grandfathers. Britons are still bad ones to beat when the trial comes.\"  \"They must leave their constitutions at their clubs, then, and their nervous system in their hat-boxes,\" growls Usk. \"If you are like those namby-pamby fellows when you are twenty, Boom, I'll put a bullet through your head myself,\" he says to his heir one morning, when that good-looking and high-spirited boy has come back from Suffolk.  Boom laughs. He is a careless, high-spirited, extravagant lad, and he does not at present lean towards the masher type. Gordon is in his head; that is his idea of a man. The country had one hero in this century, and betrayed him, and honors his betrayer; but the hearts of the boys beat truer than that of the House of Commons and the New Electorate. They remember Gordon, with a noble, headlong, quixotic wish to go and do likewise. That one lonely figure standing out against the yellow light of the desert may perhaps be as a pharos to the youth of his nation, and save them from the shipwreck which is nigh.  \"Curious type, the young fellows,\" says Brandolin, musingly. \"I don't think they will keep England what our fathers and grandfathers made it. I don't think they will, even if Chamberlain and Company will let them, which they certainly won't.\"  \"Tell you what it is,\" says Usk, \"it all comes of having second horses hunting, and loaders behind you out shooting.\"  \"You confound cause and effect. The race wouldn't have come to second horses and men to load if it hadn't degenerated. Second horses and men to load indicate in England just what pasties of nightingales' tongues, and garlands of roses, indicated with the Romans,--effeminacy and self-indulgence. The Huns and the Goths were knocking at their doors, and Demos and the Dbacle are knocking at ours. History repeats itself, which is lamentable, for its amazing tendency to tell the same tale again and again makes it a bore.  \"I should like to know, by the way,\" he continues, \"why English girls get taller and taller, stronger and stronger, and are as the very palm of the desert for vigor and force, whilst the English young man gets smaller and smaller, slighter and slighter, and has the nerves of an old maid and the habits of a valetudinarian. It is uncommonly droll; and, if the disparity goes on increasing, the ladies will not only get the franchise, but they will carry the male voter to the polling-place on their shoulders.\"  \"As the French women did their husbands out of some town that surrendered in some war,\" said Boom, who was addicted to historical illustration and never lost occasion to display it.  \"They won't carry their _husbands_,\" murmurs Brandolin. \"They'll drive _them_, and carry somebody else.\"  \"Will they have any husbands at all when they can do as they like?\" says Boom.  \"Probably not,\" says Brandolin. \"My dear boy, what an earthly paradise awaits you when you shall be of mature age, and shall have seen us all descend one by one into the tomb, with all our social prejudices and antiquated ways!\"  \"I dare say he'll be a navvy in New Guinea by that time, and all his acres here will be being let out by the state at a rack-rent which the people will call free land,\" says the father, with a groan.  \"Very possible, too,\" replies Brandolin.  The boy's eyes go thoughtfully towards the landscape beyond the windows, the beautiful lawns, the smiling gardens, the rolling woods. A look of resolution comes over his fair frank face.  \"They shan't take our lands without a fight for it,\" he says, with a flush on his cheeks.  \"And the fight will be a fierce one,\" says Brandolin, with a sigh, \"and I am afraid it is in Mr. Gladstone's 'dim and distant future,'--that is to say, very near at hand indeed.\"  \"Well, I shall be ready,\" says the lad. Both his father and Brandolin are silent, vaguely touched by the look of the gallant and gracious boy, as he stands there with the sun in his brave blue eyes, and thinking of the troubled time which will await his manhood in this green old England, cursed by the spume of wordy demagogues, and hounded on to envenomed hatreds and causeless discontents, that the professional politician may fatten on her woes.  What will Boom live to see?  It will be a sorry day for the country when her wooded parks and stately houses are numbered with the things that are no more.  Brandolin puts his arm over the boy's shoulder, and walks away with him a little way under the deep boughs of yew.  \"Look here, Boom,\" he says to him, \"you won't care to be like those fellows, but you don't know how hard it is to get out of the fashion of one's set, to avoid going with the stream of one's contemporaries. Nobody can say what will be the style of the 'best men' when you're of age, but I'm much afraid it will still be the Masher. The Masher is not very vicious, he is often cultured, he is a more harmless animal than he tries to appear, but he is weak; and we are coming on times, or times are coming on us, when an English gentleman will want to be very strong if he is to hold his own and save his country from shame in her old age. Don't be conventional. Scores of people who would be ashamed to seem virtuous haven't courage to resist appearing vicious. Don't talk all that odious slang which is ruining English. Don't get into that stupid way of counting the days and seasons by steeple-chases, coursing-meetings, flat-races, and the various different things to be shot at. Sport is all very well in its place, but Squire Allworthy beating the turnips with a brace of setters is a different figure to Lord Newgold sending his hampers of pheasants to Leadenhall. Certainly, Mr. Bradlaugh has no more right to make a misdemeanor of our covert-shooting, and put the axe to our home woods, than we have to make a misdemeanor of his shoes and stockings, or put an axe to his head. But I think if of our own accord we centred our minds and spent our guineas less on our preserves, we might be wiser, and if we grudged our woods less to the hawk and the woodpecker and the owl and the jay, and all the rest of their native population, we should be wiser still. I never see a beast or a bird caught or dead in a keeper's trap but that I think to myself that after all, if we ourselves are caught in the end between the grinning jaws of anarchy, it will really be only partial justice on our injustice. Only I fear that it won't better the birds and beasts very much, even when we all go to prison for the crime of property, and Bradlaugh will grub up their leafy haunts with a steam plough from Chicago.\"     CHAPTER IV.   Meanwhile, let the country be going to the dogs as it may, Surrenden is full of very gay people, and all its more or less well-matched doves are cooing at Surrenden, whilst the legitimate partners of their existences are diverting themselves in other scenes, Highland moors, German baths, French chteaux, Channel yachting, or at other English country houses. It is George Usk's opinion that the whole thing is immoral: he is by no means a moral person himself. His wife, on the contrary, thinks that it is the only way to have your house liked, and that nobody is supposed to know anything, and that nothing of that sort matters; she is a woman who on her own account has never done anything that she would in the least mind having printed in the _Morning Post_ to-morrow.  \"Strange contradiction!\" muses Brandolin. \"Here is George, who's certainly no better than he should be, hallooing out for Dame Propriety, and here's my lady, who's always run as straight as a crow flies, making an Agapemone of her house to please her friends. To the pure all things are pure, I suppose; but if purity can stand Mrs. Wentworth Curzon and Lady Dawlish, I think I shall select my wife from among _les jolies impures_.\"  However, he takes care audibly to hold up his hostess's opinions and condemn her lord's.  \"The poor little woman means well, and only likes to be popular,\" he reflects; \"and we are none of us so sure that we shan't want indulgence some day.\"  Brandolin is very easy and elastic in his principles, as becomes a man of the world; he is even considered by many of his friends a good deal too lax in all his views; but in the depths of his soul there is a vague dislike to similar looseness of principle in women. He may have been glad enough to avail himself of the defect; that is another matter; he does not like it, does not admire it: licentiousness in a woman seems to him a fault in her taste; it is as if she wore fur slippers with her court train. \"Of course,\" he will say, apologetically, \"this idea of mine is born of the absurd English conventionality which sleeps in all of us; nothing better; an Englishman is always conventional somewhere, let him live as he will.\"  He himself is the most unconventional of beings, appalls his county, terrifies his relations, and irrevocably offends the bishop of his diocese; he has lived with Arabs, Bohemians, and wild men of the woods, and believes that he has not such a thing as prejudice about him; yet at the bottom of his soul there is this absurd feeling born of sheer conventionality,--he cannot thoroughly like a light-minded woman. Absurd, indeed, in the times in which his lot is cast! He is quite ashamed of it.  Dorothy Usk does not favor the modern mode of having relays of guests for two or three days; she thinks it makes a country house too like an hotel. She wishes her people to be perfectly well assorted, and then to stay with her at least a week, even two weeks or three weeks. People do not often object: Orme, Denton, and Surrenden are all popular places, and Surrenden is perhaps most popular of all.  \"An ideal house,\" says Brandolin, who would not stay a day where he was not as free as air.  \"It's too much like an hotel,\" grumbles the master of it, \"and an hotel where the _table-d'hte_ bell rings to deaf ears. Lord! I remember in my poor mother's days everybody had to be down to breakfast at nine o'clock every morning as regularly as if they were charity children, and the whole lot of 'em were marched off to church on Sunday whether they liked it or not. The villagers used to line the path across the fields to see the great folks pass. Now it's as much as ever Dolly can do to get a woman or two up in time to go with her. How things are changed, by Jove! And it isn't so very long ago, either.\"  \"The march of intellect, my dear George,\" says Brandolin; \"neither _le bon Dieu_ nor we are great folks any longer.\"  \"Well, I think it's a pity,\" sighs Usk. \"Everybody was happier then, and jollier too, though we do tear about so to try and get amused.\"  \"There is still nothing to prevent you going to sleep in the big pew if it pleases you,\" replies Brandolin; \"and Lawrence Hamilton always goes that he may look at Mrs. Curzon's profile as she sings: she is really saintly then. I think Sunday service is to Englishwomen what confession is to Catholic ladies: it sweeps all the blots off the week's tablets. It is convenient, if illogical.\"  \"You are very irreligious,\" says his host, who is invariably orthodox when orthodoxy doesn't interfere with anything.  \"Not more so than most people,\" says Brandolin. \"I have even felt religious when I have been alone in the savannas or in the jungle. I don't feel so in a wooden box covered with red velvet, with a curate bawling in my ears about the hewing in pieces of Agag.\"  \"That's nothing to do with it,\" says Usk: \"we're bound to set an example.\"  \"That's why you doze in public, and Mrs. Curzon wears her big pearls, to lead the school-children in the way they should go.\"  \"That's nothing to do with it,\" repeats Lord Usk, somewhat crossly. He has a comfortable if indistinct idea that he does something patriotic, patriarchal, and highly praiseworthy in getting up an hour earlier than usual one Sunday out of three, and putting on a tall hat, a frock-coat, and a pair of new gloves, to attend the village church for morning service when he is at Orme, Denton, or Surrenden in fine weather.  If he sleeps, what of that? There are curtains to the pew, and nobody sees him except the Babe, who takes fiendish rapture in catching big flies and releasing them from a careful little hand to alight on his father's forehead or nose. The Babe would define the Sunday morning as a horrid bore tempered by blue-bottles.  \"What a curiously conventional mind is the English mind!\" thinks Brandolin, when he is alone. \"Carlisle is right: the gig is its standard. The gig is out of fashion as a vehicle, but the national mind remains the same as in the age of gigs,--content with the outside of things, clinging to the husk, to the shell, to the outward appearance, and satisfied with these. My dear friend puts on his chimney-pot, then takes it off and snores in his pew, and thinks that he has done something holy which will sustain both Church and State, as he thinks that he prays when he buries his face in his hat and creases his trousers on a hassock! Mysterious consolations of the unfathomable human breast!\"     CHAPTER V.   A few new people have come by the brake, and make their appearance at luncheon. More come by the five-o'clock train, and are visible at six-o'clock tea, which is always to be had in the library any time before seven: dinner at all the Usk houses is always at nine. Brandolin's doctrines do not prevail with any of his acquaintances, although he, unlike most professors, emphasizes them by example.  Among the people who come by the latter train are the famous Mr. Wootton, a man very famous at London dinner-parties, and Lady Gundrede Vansittart, whose dinners are the best in London.  \"Where would those two people be if you brought the pulse and the rice you recommend into fashion?\" says their host to Brandolin. \"Take 'em away from the table, they'd be good for nothing. He wouldn't say 'Bo' to a goose, and she wouldn't be worth leaving a card upon. Believe me, my dear Guy, such _esprit_ as there is left in us is only brought out by eating.\"  \"I think you invert all your reasonings,\" says Brandolin. \"Say rather, that too much eating has destroyed all _esprit_. Don't we eat all day long everywhere, or at least are expected to do so? You lament your ruined digestion. It is impossible to digest when time is only counted by what our beloved Yankees call square meals (why square I fail to fathom), and for women it is worse than for us, because they eat such quantities of sweet things we don't touch, and then the way they go in for caviare bread-and-butter, and anchovy sandwiches, and all kinds of rich cakes, and _deux doigts de Madre_ or glasses of kmmel at the tea-hour,--it is frightful! I wonder they have any complexions at all left, even with the assistance of all the '_secrets de Vnus_.'\"  \"You won't alter 'em, my dear fellow,\" replies Usk, \"if you put yourself out about it ever so much. If you were to marry a savage out of Formosa, or an Esquimaux, she'd take kindly to the caviare and the kmmel before a week was out, if you brought her to Europe. Why, look at dogs,--you may keep 'em on biscuit and tripe if they live in the kennels, but if they once come to the dining-room they'll turn their noses up at a beef-steak if it isn't truffled!\"  \"Dogs, at least, stop short of the kmmel,\" says Brandolin; \"but if you were to put together the sherry, the dry champagne, the liqueurs at tea, the brandy in the _chasse_ at dinner, which a fashionable woman takes in the course of the day (not counting any pick-me-up that she may require in her own room), the amount would be something enormous,--incredible! You would not believe the number of women who have cured me of an unhappy passion for them by letting me see what a lot they could drink.\"  \"You will adore the Sabaroff, then. She never touches anything that I see, except tea.\"  \"Admirable person! I am ready to adore her. Tell me more about her. By the way, who is she?\"  \"Oh, you must go to Dolly for biographies of her foreigners. I can't keep even their names in my head.\"  \"Foreigners! What an expression!\" cries Dorothy Usk, in disdain. \"Since steam effaced frontiers, nobody but insular people like ourselves ever use such a term. Nationalities are obliterated.\"  She is very fond of Xenia Sabaroff: she has a great many warm attachments to women who help to make her house attractive.  \"Nationalities are still discernible in different tobaccos,\" murmurs Brandolin. \"The Havana won't acknowledge an equal in the Cavour.\"  \"Dolly don't know anything about her,\" continues Usk, clinging to the subject.  \"Oh, my dear!\" cried his wife, shocked, \"when she is the niece of the great Chancellor and her mother was a Princess Dourtza.\"  \"You don't know anything about her,\" repeats Usk, with that unpleasant obstinacy characteristic of men when they talk to their wives. \"You met her in Vienna and took one of your crazes for her, and she may have sent a score of lovers to Siberia, or deserve to go there herself, for anything you can tell. One can never be sure of anything about foreigners.\"  \"How absurd you are, and how _insular_!\" cries Dorothy Usk, again. \"'Foreigners!' As if there were any foreigners in these days, when Europe is like one family!\"  \"A family which, like most families, squabbles and scratches pretty often, then,\" says Usk,--which seems to his wife a reply too vulgar to be worthy of contradiction. He is conscious that Xenia Sabaroff is a very great lady, and that her quarterings, backed by descent and alliance, are wholly irreproachable,--indeed, written in that _libro d'oro_, the \"Almanach de Gotha,\" for all who choose to read.  Her descent and her diamonds are alike immaculate, but her character?--he is too old-fashioned a Briton not to think it very probable that there is something _louche_ there.  Usk is a Russophobist, as becomes a true Tory. He has a rooted impression that all Russians are spies when they are not swindlers; much as in the early years of the century his grandsire had been positive that all Frenchmen were assassins when they were not dancing-masters. The White Czar has replaced the Petit Caporal, and the fur cap the cocked hat, in the eyes of Englishmen of Usk's type, as an object of dread and detestation. He would never be in the least surprised if it turned out that the real object of Madame Sabaroff's visit to Surrenden were to have possible opportunities to examine the facilities of Weymouth as a landing-place for Cossacks out of Muscovite corvettes.  \"Russians are tremendous swells at palaver,\" he says, with much contempt, \"gammon you no end if you like to believe 'em: they've always some political dodge or other behind it all.\"  \"I don't say she isn't an agreeable woman,\" he continues, now: his admiration of Madame Sabaroff is much mitigated by his sense that she has a rather derisive opinion of himself. \"I don't say she isn't an agreeable woman, but she gives me the idea of artificiality,--insincerity,--mystery.\"  \"Just because she's a Russian!\" cries his wife, with disdain.  \"My dear George,\" observes Brandolin, \"there are preconceived ideas about all nationalities. As a rule, they are completely false. The received Continental idea is that an Englishman is a bluff, blunt, unpleasant, opinionated person, very cross, very clean too it is true, but on the strength of his tub and his constitution despising all the rest of mankind. Now, how completely absurd such an opinion is! You yourself are an example of the _suaviter in modo, fortiter in re_, of which the true-blue Briton always gives so admirable an example.\"  Usk laughs, but sulkily; he has the impression that his beloved friend is making fun of him, but he is not quite sure. He himself believes that he is an ideal Englishman; Brandolin is only half or a quarter of one, he does not shoot, wears furs in winter, only drinks very light Rhenish wine, never goes to any church, and never cuts his hair very short. Added to this, he has no fixed political opinion, except a general impression that England and the world in general are going down-hill as fast as they can, \"tobogganing\" as they say in Canada, at the rate of fifty miles a minute, to land in the slough of Socialism and be picked out of it by some military despot,--democracy invariably ending in absolutism.  \"What ridiculous rubbish!\" says his wife. \"You might as well say that the _demoiselles-mannequins_ at Worth's or Rodrigue's are conspiring for the Orleanists when they try on my clothes.\"  \"They are conspiring for the ruin of your family,\" says Usk, with a groan. \"Whose purse can stand those Paris prices?\"  \"What an irrelevant remark!\" cries Lady Usk. \"You are always dragging money-questions into everything.\"  \"Those _faiseurs_, as you call 'em,\" continues Usk, unheeding, \"are at the root of half the misery of society. Women get into debt up to their eyes for their toilets, and they don't care what abomination they do if they get enough out of it to go on plunging. Hundred-guinea gowns soon make up a pretty total when you change 'em three times a day.\"  \"And if women are guys aren't the men furious?\" asks his wife. \"Even if they try to economize, aren't they always taunted with being dowdies? You none of you know anything about the cost of things, and you expect everybody to be _bien mise_ on a halfpenny a day. When Boom saw me at Ascot this year he stared at me, and whispered to me, 'Oh, I say, mother! you've got the same bonnet on you had at the Oaks. I do hope the other fellows won't notice it.' That is how he will speak to his wife some day; and yet I dare say, like you, he will expect her to get her bonnets from Virot at ten francs apiece!\"  Lady Usk is angry and roused.  \"Look at my poor little sister,\" she goes on. \"What a life that brute Mersey leads her about money! All those dreadfully plain girls to dress, and nothing to do it on, and yet if they are not all well got up wherever they go to, he swears he is ashamed to be seen with them. You can't dress well, you can't do anything well, without spending money; and if you haven't money you must get into debt. That is as clear as that two and two are four. When ever do men remember their own extravagances? You smoke ten cigars a day; your cigars cost a shilling or eighteenpence each,--that is ten or fifteen shillings a day; five pounds a week, not counting your cigarettes! Good heavens! five pounds a week for sheer silly personal indulgence that your doctors tell you will canker your tongue and dry up your gastric juice! At all events, our toilets don't hurt our digestion; and what would the world look like if women weren't well dressed in it? Your cigars benefit nobody, and only make your teeth yellow.\"  \"Well, in a year they cost about what one ball-gown does that's worn twice.\"  \"I always wear mine three times, even in London,\" says Dorothy Usk, with conscious virtue. \"But I don't see any sin in spending money. I think it ought to be spent. But you are always dragging money-questions into everything, and Boom says that the Latin person whom you and Lord Brandolin are always quoting declares most sensibly that money should always be regarded as a means, never as an end; and if it is to be a means to anything, must not it be spent before it can become so?\"  \"That's neither here nor there,\" replies her lord; \"and if Boom only reads his classics upside down like that he'd better leave 'em alone.\"  \"You are never content. Most men would be delighted if a boy read _at all_.\"  \"I don't know why, I'm sure,\" replies Usk, drearily. \"Reading's going out, you know; nobody'll read at all fifty years hence: poking about in guinea-pigs' stomachs, and giving long names to insects out of the coal-hole, is what they call education nowadays.\"  \"Frederic Harrison has said very aptly,\" remarks Brandolin, who is present at this conjugal colloquy, and seeks to make a diversion on it, \"that the boast of science is to send the Indian mails across seas and deserts in nine days, but that science cannot put in those mail-bags a single letter equal to Voltaire's or Svign's, and he doubts very much that there is one.\"  \"It's an ill bird that fouls its own nest,\" says Usk, grimly: \"still, I'm very glad if those scientific prigs fall out among themselves.\"  \"I think some people write charming letters still,\" says Dorothy Usk. \"Of course when one is in a hurry--and one is almost always in a hurry----\"  \"Hurry is fatal, Lady Usk,\" says Brandolin. \"It destroys style, grace, and harmony. It is the curse of our times. The most lovely thing in life is leisure; and we call it progress to have killed it.\"  \"Read this letter,\" says his hostess, giving him one which she holds in her hand. \"There is nothing private in it, and nothing wonderful, but there is a grace in the expressions; whilst the English, for a foreigner, is absolutely marvellous.\"  \"I thought there were no foreigners?\" says Usk. \"I thought steam had effaced nationalities?\"  His wife does not deign to reply.  Brandolin has taken the letter with hesitation. \"Do you really think I may read it?\"  \"When I tell you to do so,\" says Dolly Usk, impatiently. \"Besides, there is nothing in it, only it is pretty.\"  Brandolin reads; it is on very thick paper, almost imperceptibly scented, with a princess's crown embossed on it and a gold X.       \"It is very kind of you, dear Lady Usk, to have remembered a      _solitaire_ like myself in the midst of your charming children and      your many joys.\" (\"My many annoyances, she means,\" interpolates      Lady Usk.) \"I will be with you, as you so amiably wish, next      Tuesday or Wednesday. I am for the moment in Paris, having been      this month at Aix, not that I have any aches or pains myself, but a      friend of mine, Marie Woronszoff, has many, and tries to cure them      by warm sunshine and the cold douches which her physicians      prescribe. There are many pleasant people here; every one is      supposed to be very ill and suffering agony, but every one laughs,      flirts, plays, sits under the little tents under the trees, dances      at the Casino, and eats a fair dinner as usual, so that if Pallida      Mors be indeed among us she looks just like every one else. I came      to Aix from my own place on the White Sea, and the gay groups, the      bright alleys, the green embowered chalets, and the goatherds with      their flocks which come tinkling their bells down the hill-sides in      all directions, all seemed to me like an operetta of Offenbach's,      spiritualized and washed with the pure daylight and the      mountain-air, but still Offenbach. How are your children? Do they      still care for me? That is very sweet of them. A day at their years      is as long as a season at mine. Assure them of my unforgetting      gratitude. I shall be pleased to be in England again, and, though I      do not know Surrenden, my recollections of Orme tell me _d'avance_      that I shall in any house of yours find the kindest of friends, the      most sympathetic of companions. Say many things to your lord for      me. I think he is only so discontented because the gods have been      too good to him and given him too completely everything he can      desire.\" (\"That's all _she_ knows about it!\" says Usk, _sotto      voce_.) \"_Au revoir_, dear Lady Usk. Receive the assurance of my      highest consideration, and believe in my sincere regard. _Bien       vous._--XENIA P. SABAROFF.\"  \"A very pretty letter,\" says Brandolin. \"Many thanks.\" And he restores it to its owner.  \"Bunkum!\" says Usk.  \"Not a bit in the world,\" says his wife, with contempt and indignation. \"_She_ does not 'pose,' if you do!\"  \"My dear George,\" says Brandolin, \"you are one of those thorough-going Britons who always think that everybody who doesn't deal in disagreeable remarks must be lying. Believe me, there are people who really see 'the side that's next the sun,'--even in a crab-apple.\"  \"And deuced irritating, too, they are,\" says Usk, with emphasis. \"'What a beastly bad day,' one says to 'em when it's pouring cats and dogs, and they answer, 'Oh, yes, but rain was so wanted we must be thankful.' That's the kind of answer that would make a saint swear.\"  \"You are not a saint, and you swear on small provocation,\" replies Brandolin. \"To look at rain in that light argues true philosophy. Unfortunately, philosophy is too often strained to bursting in our climate, by having to contemplate rain destroying the crops. If we only had rain when we wanted it, I think the most unreasonable among us would view it with equanimity.\"  Rain is at that moment running down the painted panes of the Surrenden casements, and driving across the lawns and terraces of the Surrenden gardens. It makes Usk very cross: all the ensilage in the world will not console him for ripening corn beaten down in all directions, and young families of pheasants dying of cramp and pip in their ferny homes.  \"Dig a big pit and cram your soaked grass into it: very well, I don't say no,\" he growls. \"But what about your mildewed wheat? And where should we be if we had to undergo a blockade? I'm not against making more pasture, grazing's all very well; but if there's a war big enough to sweep the seas of the grain-ships that come to us from the Colonies and the United States, where shall we be if we've nothing to eat but our own beef and mutton? Beef and mutton are solid food, but I believe we should all go mad on them if we'd no bread to eat too.\"  \"I'm all for pasture,\" replies Brandolin; \"and as the British Isles can never, under any cultivation whatever, feed all their population, we may as well dedicate ourselves to what is picturesque. I am fascinated by Laveleye's portrait of England when she shall have turned grazier exclusively: it is lovely: 'L'Angleterre redeviendra ce qu'elle tait sous les Tudors, un grand parc vert, parsem d'ormes et de chnes, o b[oe]ufs et moutons se promeneront dans des prairies sans limites.'\"  \"'Prairies sans limites?' when the land's to be all sliced up in little bits between peasant proprietors!\" says Usk.  \"I don't think Laveleye believes in peasant proprietors, though he is a professor of social economy.\"  \"Social economy!\" says Usk, with a groan. \"Oh, I know that fool of a word! In plain English, it means ruin all round, and fortune for a few d----d manufacturers.\"  \"The d----d manufacturer is the principal outcome of two thousand centuries of Christianity, civilization, and culture. The result is not perfectly satisfactory or encouraging, one must admit,\" says Brandolin, as he reaches down a volume of eighteenth-century memoirs, and adds, with entire irrelevancy to manufacturers or memoirs, \"Is she really as handsome as your children tell me?\"  \"Who?\" asks Usk. \"Oh, the Russian woman: yes, very good-looking. Yes, she was here at Easter, and she turned their heads.\"  \"Has she any lovers older than Babe?\"  \"She has left 'em in Russia if she has.\"  \"A convenient distance to leave anything at: Italy and Russia are the only countries remaining to us in which Messalina can still do her little murders comfortably without any fuss being made.\"  \"She isn't Messalina, at least I think not. But one never knows.\"  \"No, one never knows till one tries,\" says Brandolin. And he wishes vaguely that the Russian woman were already here. He is fond of Surrenden, and fond of all its people, but he is a little, a very little, bored. He sees that all Lady Usk's doves are paired, and he does not wish to disturb their harmony, possibly because none of the feminine doves attract him. But he cannot flirt forever with the children, because the children are not very often visible, and without flirting civilized life is dull, even for a man who is more easily consoled by ancient authors off the library-shelves than most people can be.  This conversation occurs in the forenoon in Lady Usk's boudoir. In the late afternoon in the library over their teacups the ladies talk of Xenia Sabaroff. It is perceptible to Brandolin that they would prefer that she should not arrive.  \"Is she really so very good-looking?\" he asks of Mrs. Wentworth Curzon.  \"Oh, yes,\" replies that lady, with an accent of depreciation in her tones. \"Yes, she is very handsome; but too pale, and her eyes too large. You know those Russian women are mere _paquets de nerfs_, shut up in their rooms all day and smoking so incessantly: they have all that is worst in the Oriental and Parisienne mixed together.\"  \"How very sad!\" says Brandolin. \"I don't think I have known one, except Princess Kraskawa: she went sleighing in all weathers, wore the frankest of gingerbread wigs, and was always surrounded by about fifty grandchildren.\"  Princess Kraskawa had been for many years ambassadress in London.  \"Of course there are exceptions,\" says Nina Curzon; \"but generally, you know, they are very depraved, such inordinate gamblers, and so fond of morphine, and always _maladives_.\"  \"Ah,\" says Brandolin, pensively, \"but the physical and moral perfection of Englishwomen always makes them take too high a standard: poor humanity toils hopelessly, and utterly exhausted, many miles behind them.\"  \"Don't talk nonsense,\" says Mrs. Curzon; \"we are no better than our neighbors, perhaps, but we are not afraid of the air, we don't heat our houses to a thousand degrees above boiling-point, we don't gamble,--at least not much,--and we don't talk every language under the sun except our own, and yet not one of them grammatically.\"  \"Decidedly,\" reflects Brandolin, \"Lawrence must have looked too often at Madame Sabaroff.\"  \"Sabaroff is dead, isn't he?\" he asked, aloud. \"You know I have been out of society for a year: the whole map of Europe gets altered in one's absence.\"  \"Sabaroff was shot in a duel four years ago,\" replies Mrs. Curzon,--\"a duel about her.\"  \"What a fortunate woman! To get rid of a husband, and to get rid of him in such interesting circumstances! _C'est le comble de bonheur!_\"  \"That depends. With her it resulted in her exile from court.\"  \"Oh, to be sure; when Russians are naughty they are sent to live on their estates, as riotous children are dismissed to the nursery. Was she compromised, then?\"  \"Very much compromised; and both men were killed, for the adversary of Sabaroff had been wounded mortally, when, with an immense effort, he fired, and shot the prince through the lungs.\"  \"A pretty little melodrama. Who was the opponent?\"  \"Count Lustoff, a colonel of the Guard. I wonder you did not hear of it: it made a stir at the time.\"  \"I may have heard: when one doesn't know the people concerned, no massacre, even of the Innocents, makes any impression on one. And the result was that the lady had to leave the imperial court?\"  \"Yes: they do draw a line _there_.\"  Brandolin laughs; it tickles his fancy to hear Mrs. Wentworth Curzon condemning by implication the laxity of the court of St. James.  \"They can't send _us_ to our estates,\" he replies, \"the lands are so small and the railways are so close. Else it would have a very good effect if all our naughty people could be shut up inside their own gates, with nobody to speak to but the steward and the rector. Can you imagine anything that would more effectively contribute to correct manners and morals? But how very desolate London would look!\"  \"You think everybody would be exiled inside his own ring-fence!\"  \"_Her_ own ring-fence,--well, nearly everybody. There would certainly be no garden-parties at Marlborough House.\"  Mrs. Wentworth Curzon is not pleased; she is a star of the first magnitude at Marlborough House.  \"Why does she take this absent woman's character away?\" thinks Brandolin, with a sense of irritation. \"I will trust the Babe's instincts sooner than hers.\"  He does not know Xenia Sabaroff; but he admires the photograph of her which stands on the boudoir table, and he likes the tone of the letter written from Aix. With that spirit of contradiction which is inborn in human nature, he is inclined to disbelieve all that Nina Curzon has told him. Lustoff and Sabaroff probably both deserved their fates, and the departure from the court of St. Petersburg might very possibly have been voluntary. He has a vague feeling of tenderness for the original of the photograph. It often happens to him to fall sentimentally and ephemerally in love with some unknown woman whose portrait he has seen or of whose charms he has heard. Sometimes he has avoided knowing these in their actual life, lest he should disturb his ideals. He is an imaginative man with a great amount of leisure in which to indulge his fancies, and his knowledge of the world has not hardened his feelings or dulled his fancy. There is something of the Montrose, of the Lord Surrey, in him.  \"To think of all one knows about that hussy,\" he muses, as he smokes a cigar in his bedroom before dressing for dinner. By the uncomplimentary epithet he means Mrs. Wentworth Curzon. \"Such a good fellow as Fred Curzon is, too, a man who might have been made anything of if she'd only treated him decently. When he married her he adored the ground she walked on, but before a week was out she began to fret him, and jar at him, and break him in, as she called it; he was too poor for her, and too slow for her, and too good for her, and she was vilely cruel to him,--it's only women who can be cruel like that, she's had more lovers than anybody living, and she's taken every one of 'em for money; nothing but money. Old Melton gave her the Park-Lane House, and Glamorgan gave her her emeralds, and Dartmoor paid her Paris bills for ten years, and Riverston takes all her stable-expenses. Everything she does is done for money; and if she puts any heart at all now into this thing with Lawrence, it is only because she's getting older and so getting jealous,--they always do as they get on,--and then she calls Russians dissolute and depraved, good Lord!\"  With which he casts aside his cigar, and resigns himself to his servant's hands as the second gong sounds.     CHAPTER VI.   The very bachelor rooms at Surrenden are conducive to revery and indolence, cosily comfortable and full of little attentions for the guest's _bien-tre_, among which there is a printed paper which is always laid on the dressing-table in every room at this house: it contains the latest telegrams of public news, which come every afternoon from a London news-agency.  \"I dare say to the political fellows they are delightful,\" reflects Brandolin, as he glances down the lines, \"but to me they unpleasantly recall an uncomfortable world. I don't dine the worse, certainly, for knowing that there is a revolution in Patagonia or an earthquake in Bolivia, but neither do I dine the better for being told that the French government is _destituant_ all moderate prefets in favor of immoderate ones. It is very interesting, no doubt, but it doesn't interest me, and I think the possession of these fresh scraps of prosaic news spoils dinner-conversation.\"  Brandolin does not consider it conversation to say, \"Have you seen so-and-so?\" or, \"What a sad thing such-and-such is, isn't it!\" He likes persiflage, he likes banter, he likes argument, he likes antithesis, he likes brilliancy, and the dinner-tables of the epoch seldom offer these good things with their Metternich hock and Mouton Rothschild. He is fond of talking himself, and he can be also a very good listener. If you cannot give the _quid quo pro_ in hearing as in speaking, you may be immensely clever, but you will be immediately pronounced a bore, like Macaulay and Madame de Stal. Brandolin likes talking not for the sake of showing himself off, but for the sake of being amused, of eliciting the opinions and observing the minds of others, and he is convinced that if the conversational art were cultured as it used to be in Bourbon Paris, life would become more refined, more agreeable, more sympathetic, and less given over to gross pleasures of the appetites.  \"Children should be taught to talk,\" he observes one day to Lady Usk, \"and they should not be allowed to be slovenly in their speech any more than in their dress. You would not let them enter your presence with unbrushed hair, but you do let them use any bald, slangy, or inappropriate words which come uppermost to them. There is so much in the choice of words! A beautiful voice is a delicious thing, but it avails little without the usage of apt and graceful phrases. Did you ever hear Mrs. Norton sustain a discussion or relate an anecdote? It was like listening to perfect phrasing in music. When she died, the art of conversation died with her.\"  \"We are always in such a hurry,\" says Lady Usk, which is her habitual explanation of anything in which her generation is at fault. \"And hurry is always vulgar, you know, as you said the other day: it cannot help itself.\"  \"You are a purist, my dear Brandolin,\" says Lady Dolgelly, who hates him.  \"'Purity, daughter of sweet virtues mild!'\" murmurs Brandolin. \"Alas, my dear ladies, I cannot hope that she dwells with _me_ in any form! When she has a home in your own gentle breasts, who can hope that she would ever take shelter in a man's?\"  \"How impertinent and how nasty he is!\" thinks the lady; and she detests him a little more cordially than before. There is not a very good feeling towards him among any of the ladies at Surrenden: he does not make love to them, he does not endeavor to alter existing arrangements in his favor; it is generally felt that he would not care to do so. What can you expect from a man who sits half his days in a library?  The Surrenden library is well stored, an elegant and lettered lord of the eighteenth century having been a bibliophile. It is a charming room, panelled with inlaid woods, and with a ceiling painted after Tiepolo; the bookcases are built into the wall, so that the books look _chez eux_, and are not mere lodgers or visitors; oriel windows look out on to a portion of the garden laid out by Beaumont. One window has been cut down to the ground, an anachronism and innovation indeed, somewhat impairing the uniformity of the room. The present Lady Usk had it done, but one forgives her the sacrilege when one feels how pleasant it is to walk out from the mellow shadows of the library on to the smooth-shaven grass and gather a rose with one hand whilst holding an eighteenth-century author with the other.  It is in the smaller library adjacent, filled with modern volumes, that five-o'clock tea is always to be had, with all the abundant demoralizing abominations of caviare, kmmel, etc. It is a gay room, with _dessus-des-portes_ after Watteau and every variety of couch and of lounging-chair. \"Reading made easy\" somebody calls it. But there is little reading done either in it or in the big library: Brandolin when he goes there finds himself usually alone, and can commune as he chooses with Latin philosophy and Gaulois wit.  \"You _used_ to read, George?\" he says to his host, in expostulation.  \"Yes, I used,--ages ago,\" says Usk, with a yawn.  Brandolin looks at him with curiosity.  \"I can understand a man who has never read,\" he replies, \"but I cannot understand a man losing the taste for reading if he has ever had it. One can dwell contented in B[oe]otia if one has never been out of it, but to go back to B[oe]otia after living in Attica----\"  \"It's one's life does it.\"  \"What life? One has the life one wishes.\"  \"That's the sort of thing a man says who hasn't married.\"  \"My dear George, you cannot pretend your wife would prevent your reading Latin and Greek, or even Sanscrit. I am sure she would much sooner you read them than--well, than do other things you do do.\"  \"I don't say she would prevent me,\" returns the lord of Surrenden, with some crossness, \"but it's the kind of life one gets into that kills all that sort of thing in one. There is no time for it.\"  \"I keep out of the life: why don't you?\"  \"There's no time for anything,\" says Usk, gloomily. \"There's such heaps of things to see to, and such numbers of places to go to, and then one lives _au jour le jour_, and one gets into the swim and goes on, and then there's the shooting, and when there isn't the shooting there's the season, and the racing.\"  \"I lead my own life,\" Brandolin remarks.  \"Yes; but you don't mind being called eccentric.\"  \"No; I don't mind it in the least. If they say nothing worse of me I am grateful.\"  \"But you couldn't do it if you had all my places, and all my houses, and all my brothers, and all my family. You're a free agent. I declare that all the time goes away with me in such a crowd of worries that I've hardly a second to smoke a cigarette in, in any peace!\"  Brandolin smiles.  A sixth part of most days his host passes leaning back in some easy-chair with a cigar in his mouth, whether his venue be Surrenden, Orme, Denton, the smoking-room of a club, or the house of a friend,--whether London or the country. Usk's own view of himself is of a man entirely devoted to, and sacrificed to, business, politics, the management of his estates, and the million-and-one affairs which perpetually assail him; but this is not the view which his friends take of him.  When ever is the view that our friends take of us our view?  \"Once a scholar always a scholar, it seems to me,\" says Brandolin. \"I could as soon live without air as without books.\" And he quotes Cowley,--      \"Books should as business entertain the light.\"  \"You don't continue the quotation,\" says Usk, with a smile.  \"_Autres temps autres m[oe]urs_,\" says Brandolin. He laughs, and gets up: it is four in the afternoon; the delicious green garden is lying bathed in warm amber light; one of the peacocks is turning round slowly with all his train displayed; he seems never to tire of turning round.  \"How exactly that bird is like some politicians one could name!\" says Brandolin. \"Do you know that this charming garden always reminds me of St. Hubert's Lea,--our west garden, I mean? I think the same man must have laid them out. Is it not Bulwer Lytton who says that so long as one has a garden one always has one room which is roofed by heaven?\"  \"A heaven mitigated by gardeners' wages,--very considerably mitigated,\" says Usk.  \"You are cynical, George, and your mind is running on pounds, shillings, and pence,--an offence against Nature on such a day as this. There is nothing so demoralizing as to think of money.\"  \"To have debts and not to think of 'em is more so; and Boom----\"  \"Sell something of his that he likes very much, to pay his debts: that's the only way I know of to check a boy at the onset. Your father did it with me the very first time I owed twenty pounds; and he read me a lesson I never forgot. I have been eternally obliged to him ever since.\"  \"What did he sell?\"  \"My cob,--a cob I adored. I wept like a child, but he didn't see my tears. What I saved up next half to trace out that cob and buy him back at twice his value,--what I denied myself to make up the money,--nobody would believe; and the beast wasn't easy to find: some dealer had taken him over to Ireland.\"  \"That could be done with you,\" says Usk, gloomily. \"It would be no use to do it with Boom: his mother would buy him some other horse the next day. You've no chance to bring up a boy decently if he's got a mother!\"  \"The reverse is the received opinion of mankind,\" said Brandolin; \"but I believe there's something to be said for your view. No end of women have no idea of bringing up their children, and when they ought to be ordered a flogging they fondle them.\"  \"Dolly does,\" says her husband. \"What's a woman's notion of a horse? That he must have slender legs, a coat like satin, and be fed on apples and sugar: still, they saw his mouth till he half dislocates his neck, and tear his ribs open with their spur. They're just as unreasonable with their children.\"  \"Who is _that_ woman?\" says Brandolin, making a step across the window and into the garden. \"Now I am perfectly certain that is Madame Sabaroff, without your saying so.\"  \"Then I needn't say so,\" replies Usk. \"I wonder when she came. They didn't expect her till to-morrow.\"  They both look at a lady in one of the distant alleys walking between the high green walls. She is dressed in some soft cream-colored stuff with quantities of lace. She carries a sunshade of the same hue. She has a tall cane in her other hand. On either side of her are the Ladies Alexandra and Hermione, and before her gambols in his white sailor clothes, with his blue silk stockings and his silver-buckled shoes, the Babe.  \"Decidedly the Sabaroff,\" says Usk. \"Won't you come and speak to her?\"  \"With pleasure,\" says Brandolin. \"Even if the Babe brains me with the cane!\"  He looks very well as he walks bareheaded over the grass and along the green alley; he wears a loose brown velvet coat admirably made, and brown breeches and stockings; his legs are as well made as his coat; the sun shines on his curling hair; there is a _dgag_, picturesque, debonair, yet distinguished look about him, which pleases the eyes of Xenia Sabaroff, as they watch him draw near.  \"Who is that person with your father?\" she asks. The children tell her, all speaking at once.  She recognizes the name; she has heard of him often in the world, and has read those books which praise solitude and a dinner of herbs. \"I doubt his having been alone very long, however,\" she reflects, as she looks at him. A certain unlikeness in him to Englishmen in general, some women who are fond of him fancifully trace to the fact that the first Brandolin was a Venetian, who fled for his life from the Republic, and made himself conspicuous and acceptable for his talents alike as a lutist and a swordsman at the court of Henry the Second. \"It can't count, it's so very far away,\" he himself objects; but perhaps it does count. Of all things ineffaceable, the marks of race are the most indelible.  The Venetian Brandolin married the daughter of a Norman knight, and his descendants became affectionate sons of England, and held their lands of St. Hubert's Lea safely under the wars of the Roses, of the Commonwealth, and of the Jacobites. They were always noticeable for scholarly habits and artistic tastes, and in the time of George the Second the Lord Brandolin of the period did much to enrich his family mansion and diminish the family fortunes by his importations of Italian sculptures and pictures and his patronage of Italian musicians. The house at St. Hubert's Lea is very beautiful, but it requires much more to keep it up than the present owner possesses. He is often urged to let it, but he scouts the idea. \"You might as well ask me to sell the Brandolin portraits, like Charles Surface,\" he says, angrily, whenever his more intimate friends venture on the suggestion. So the old house stands in its warm-hued and casket-like loveliness, empty, save for his occasional visits and the presence of many old and devoted servants.  \"An interesting woman,\" he thinks now, as he exchanges with the Princess Sabaroff the usual compliments and commonplaces of a presentation. \"Russians are always interesting: they are the only women about whom you feel that you know very little; they are the only women who, in this chatterbox of a generation _tout en dehors_ as it is, preserve some of the vague charm of mystery; and what a charm that is!\"  His reasons for admiring her are not those of the Babe and his sisters, but he admires her almost as much as they. Brandolin, who in his remote travels has seen a great deal of that simple nature which is so much lauded by many people, has a great appreciation of well-dressed women, and the Madame Sabaroff is admirably dressed, from her long loose cream-colored gloves to her bronze shoes with their miniature diamond clasps.  \"Didn't I tell you?\" whispers the Babe, climbing up behind Brandolin.  \"Yes, you did,\" returned Brandolin, \"and you were quite right; but it is abominably bad manners to whisper, my dear Cecil.\"  The Babe subsides into silence with hot cheeks when anybody calls him Cecil he is conscious that he has committed some flagrant offence.  \"Those brats are always bothering you, princess,\" says their father.  \"They are very kind to me,\" replies Xenia Sabaroff, in English which has absolutely no foreign accent. \"They make me feel at home! What a charming place this is! I like it better than your castle--what is its name?--where I had the pleasure to visit you at Easter.\"  \"Orme. Oh, that's beastly,--a regular barn: obliged to go there just for show, you know.\"  \"Orme was built by Inigo Jones, and the ingratitude to fortune of its owner is a constant temptation to Providence to deal in thunder-bolts, or have matches left about by housemaids,\" says Brandolin.  \"I think Lord Usk has not a contented mind,\" says Madame Sabaroff, amused.  \"Contented! By Jove, who should be, when England's going to the dogs as fast as she can?\"  \"In every period of your history,\" says the princess, \"your country is always described as going headlong to ruin; and yet she has not gone there yet, and she has not done ill.\"  \"'Our constitution is established on a mere equipoise, with dark precipices and deep waters all around it.' So said Burke,\" replies Brandolin. \"At the present moment everybody has forgotten the delicacy of this nice equipoise, and one day or other it will lose its balance and topple over into the deep waters, and be engulfed. Myself, I confess I do not think that time is very distant.\"  \"I hope it is; I am very much attached to England,\" replies the Princess Xenia, gravely, \"and to naughty English boys,\" she adds, passing her hand over the shining locks of the Babe.  \"She must be in love with an Englishman,\" thinks Brandolin, with the one-sided construction which a man is always ready to place on the words of a woman. \"Must we go in-doors?\" he asks, regretfully, as she is moving towards the house. \"It is so pleasant in these quaint green arbors. To be under a roof on such a summer afternoon as this, is to fly in the face of a merciful Creator with greater ingratitude than Usk's ingratitude to Inigo Jones.\"  \"But I have scarcely seen my hostess,\" says Madame Sabaroff; nevertheless, she resigns herself to a seat in a yew-tree cut like a helmet.  There are all manner of delightful old-fashioned flowers, such flowers as Disraeli gave to the garden of Corisande, growing near in groups encircled by clipped box-edging.  Those disciples of Pallas Athene who render the happy lives of the Surrenden children occasionally a burden to them seize at that moment on their prey and bear them off to the school-room. The Babe goes to his doom sullenly; he would be tearful, only that were too unmanly.  \"Why do you let those innocents be tortured, George?\" asks Brandolin.      \"Books should, like business, entertain the day,\"  replies Usk: \"so you said, at least, just now. Their governesses are of the same opinion.\"  \"That is not the way to make them love books, to shut them up against their wills on a summer afternoon.\"  \"How will you educate your children when you have 'em, then?\"  \"He always gets out of any impersonal argument by putting some personal question,\" complains Brandolin to Madame Sabaroff. \"It is a common device, but always an unworthy one. Because a system is very bad, it does not follow that I alone of all men must be prepared with a better one. I think if I had children I would not have them taught in that way at all. I should get the wisest old man I could find, a Samuel Johnson touched with a John Ruskin, and should tell him to make learning delightful to them, and associated, as far as our detestable climate would allow, with open-air studies in cowslip meadows and under hawthorn hedges. If I had only read dear Horace at school, should I ever have loved him as I do? No; my old tutor taught me to feel all the delight and the sweet savor of him, roaming in the oak woods of my own old place.\"  \"I am devoutly thankful,\" says his host, \"that Dorothy among her caprices had never had the fancy you have, for a Dr. Johnson _doubl_ with a Ruskin, to correct my quotations, abuse my architecture, and make prigs of the children.\"  \"Prigs!\" exclaims Brandolin. \"Prigs! When did ever real scholarship and love of nature make anything approaching to a prig? Science and class-rooms make prigs, not Latin verse and cowslip meadows.\"  \"That is true, I think,\" says the Princess Xenia, with her serious smile.  \"If they are beginning to agree with one another I shall be _de trop_,\" thinks Usk, who is very good-natured to his guests, and popular enough with women not to be resigned to play what is vulgarly termed \"second fiddle\" (though why an expression borrowed from the orchestra should be vulgar it were hard to say). So he goes a few paces off to speak to a gardener, and by degrees edges away towards the house, leaving Brandolin and Madame Sabaroff to themselves in the green yew-helmet arbor.  Brandolin is in love with his subject, and does not abandon it.  \"It is absurd,\" he continues, \"the way in which children are made to loathe all scholarship by its association with their own pains and subjection. A child is made as a punishment to learn by rote fifty lines of Virgil. Good heavens! It ought rather to be as a reward that he should be allowed to open Virgil! To walk in all those delicious paths of thought should be the highest pleasure that he could be brought to know. To listen to the music of the poets should be at once his privilege and his recompense. To be deprived of books should be, on the contrary, his cruellest chastisement!\"  \"He would be a very exceptional child, surely,\" says Madame Sabaroff.  \"I was not an exceptional child,\" he answers, \"but that is how I was brought up and how I felt.\"  \"You had an exceptional training, then?\"  \"It ought not to be exceptional: that is just the mischief. Up to the time I was seventeen, I was brought up at my own place (by my father's directions, in his will) by a most true and reverent scholar, whom I loved as Burke loved Shackleton. He died, God rest his soul, but the good he left behind him lives after him: whatever grains of sense I have shown, and whatever follies I have avoided, both what I am and what I am not, are due to him, and it is to him that I owe the love of study which has been the greatest consolation and the purest pleasure of my life. That is why I pity so profoundly those poor Rochefort children, and the tens of thousands like them, who are being educated by the commonplace, flavorless, cramming system which people call education. It may be education; it is not culture. What will the Babe always associate with his Latin themes? Four walls, hated books, inky, aching fingers, and a headache. Whereas I never look at a Latin line in a newspaper, be it one ever so hackneyed, without pleasure, as at the face of an old friend, and whenever I repeat to myself the words, I always smell the cowslips and the lilac and the hawthorn of the spring mornings when I was a boy.\"  Xenia Sabaroff looked at him with some little wonder and more approval.  \"My dear lord,\" she says seriously, \"I think in your enthusiasm you forget one thing, that there is ground on which good seed falls and brings forth flowers and fruit, and there is other ground on which the same seed, be it strewn every so thickly, lies always barren. Without underrating the influences of your tutor, I must believe that had you been educated at an English public school, or even in a French Lyce, you would still have become a scholar, still have loved your books.\"  \"Alas, madame,\" says Brandolin, with a little sigh, \"perhaps I have only been what Matthew Arnold calls a 'foiled circuitous wanderer' in the orbit of life!\"  \"I imagine that you have not very often been foiled,\" replies the lady, with a smile, \"and wandering has a great deal to be said in its favor, especially for a man. Women are happiest, perhaps, at anchor.\"  \"Women used to be: not our women. _Nous avons chang tout cela._ I have bored you too much with myself and my opinions.\"  \"No, you interest me,\" says his companion with a serious serenity which deprives the words of all sound of flattery or encouragement. \"I have long admired your writings,\" she adds, and Brandolin colors a little with gratification. The same kind of phrase is said to him on an average five hundred times a year, and his usual emotion is either ennui or irritation. The admiration of fools is folly, and humiliates him. But the admiration of so lovely a woman as Xenia Sabaroff would lay a flattering unction to the soul of any man, even if she were absolutely mindless; and she gives him the impression that she has a good deal of mind, and one out of the common order.  \"My writings have no other merit,\" he says, after the expression of his sense of the honor she does him, \"than being absolutely the chronicle of what I have seen and what I have thought; and I think they are expressed in tolerably pure English, though that is claiming a great deal in these times; for since John Newman laid down the pen there is scarcely a living Briton who can write his own tongue with eloquence and purity.\"  \"I think it must be very nice to leave off wandering if one has a home,\" replies Madame Sabaroff, with a slight sigh, which gave him the impression that, though no doubt she had many houses, she had no home. \"Where is your place that you spoke of just now?--the place where you learned to love Horace?\"  Brandolin is always pleased to speak of St. Hubert's Lea. He has a great love for it and for the traditions of his race, which makes many people accuse him of great family pride, though, as has been well said _ propos_ of a greater man than Brandolin, it is rather that sentiment which the Romans defined as piety. When he talks of his old home he grows eloquent, unreserved, cordial; and he describes with an artist's touch its antiquities, its landscapes, and its old-world and sylvan charms.  \"It must be charming to care for any place so much as that,\" says his companion, after hearing him with interest.  \"I think one cares more for places than for people,\" he replies.  \"Sometimes one cares for neither,\" says Xenia Sabaroff, with a tone which in a less lovely woman would have been morose.  \"One must suffice very thoroughly to one's self in such a case?\"  \"Oh, not necessarily.\"  At that moment there is a little bustle under a very big cedar near at hand; servants are bringing out folding tables, folding chairs, a silver camp-kettle, cakes, fruit, cream, liqueurs, sandwiches, wines, all those items of an afternoon tea on which Brandolin has animadverted with so much disgust in the library an hour before. Lady Usk has chosen to take these murderous compounds out of doors in the west garden. She herself comes out of the house with a train of her guests around her.  \"Adieu to rational conversation,\" says Brandolin, as he rises with regret from his seat under the evergreen helmet.  Xenia Sabaroff is pleased at the expression. She is too handsome for men often to speak to her rationally: they usually plunge headlong into attempts at homage and flattery, of which she is nauseated.     CHAPTER VII.   \"How do you like Lord Brandolin?\" says Lady Usk, when she can say so unobserved.  \"I like him very much,\" replies Madame Sabaroff. \"He is what one would expect him to be from his books; and that is so agreeable,--and so rare.\"  Dorothy Usk is not pleased. She does not want her Russian ph[oe]nix to admire Brandolin. She has arranged an alliance in her own mind between the Princess Sabaroff and her own cousin Alan, Lord Gervase, whom she is daily expecting at Surrenden. Gervase is a man of some note in diplomacy and society; she is proud of him, she is attached to him, she desires to see him ultimately fill all offices of state that the ambition of an Englishman can aspire to; and Xenia Sabaroff is so enormously rich, as well as so unusually handsome. It would be a perfectly ideal union; and, desiring it infinitely, the mistress of Surrenden, with that tact which distinguishes her, has never named Lord Gervase to the Princess Sabaroff nor the Princess Sabaroff to Lord Gervase. He is to be at Surrenden in a week's time. Now she vaguely wishes that Brandolin had not these eight days' start of him. But then Brandolin, she knows, will only flirt; that is to say, if the Russian lady allow him to do so: he is an unconscionable flirt, and never means anything by his tenderest speeches. Brandolin, she knows, is not a person who will ever marry; he has lost scores of the most admirable opportunities, and rejected the fairest and best-filled hands that have been offered to him. To the orderly mind of Lady Usk, he represents an Ishmael forever wandering in wild woods, outside the pale of general civilization. She can never see why people make such a fuss with him. She does not say so, because it is the fashion to make the fuss, and she never goes against a fashion. A very moral woman herself, she is only as charitable and elastic as she is to naughty people because such charity and elasticity is the mark of good society in the present day. Without it, she would be neither popular nor well bred; and she would sooner die than fail in being either.  \"Why don't you ever marry, Lord Brandolin?\" asks Dorothy Usk. \"Why have you never married?\"  \"Because he's much too sensible,\" growls her husband, but adds, with infinite compassion, \"He'll have to, some day, or the name will die out.\"  \"Yes, I shall have to, some day, to use your very grammatical expression,\" assents Brandolin. \"I don't wish the name to die out, and there's nobody to come after me except the Southesk-Vanes, who detest me as I detest them.\"  \"Well, then, why not make some marriage at once?\" says Lady Usk. \"I know so many charming----\"  Brandolin arrests the sentence with a deprecatory gesture, \"Dear Lady Usk, _please_! I like you so much, I wouldn't for worlds have you mixed up in anything which would probably, or at least very possibly, make me so much dislike you in the years to come.\"  Usk gives a laugh of much enjoyment.  His wife is slightly annoyed. She does not like this sort of jesting.  \"You said a moment ago that you must marry!\" she observes, with some impatience.  \"Oh, there is no positive 'must' about it,\" says Brandolin, dubiously. \"The name doesn't matter greatly, after all; it is only that I don't like the place to go to the Southesk-Vanes: they are my cousins, heaven knows how many times removed; they have most horrible politics, and they are such dreadfully prosaic people that I am sure they will destroy my gardens, poison my Indian beasts, strangle my African birds, turn my old servants adrift, and make the country round hideous with high farming.\"  \"Marry, then, and put an end to anything so dreadful,\" says Dorothy Usk.  Brandolin gets up and walks about the room. It is a dilemma which has often been present to his mind in various epochs of his existence.  \"You see, my dear people,\" he says, with affectionate confidence, \"the real truth of the matter is this. A good woman is an admirable creation of Providence, for certain uses in her generation; but she is tiresome. A naughty woman is delightful; but then she is, if you marry her, compromising. Which am I to take of the two? I should be bored to death by what Renan calls _la femme pure_, and against _la femme tare_ as a wife I have a prejudice. The woman who would amuse me I would not marry if I could, and as, if I were bored, I should leave my wife entirely, and go to the Equator or the Pole, it would not be honest in me to sacrifice a virgin to the mere demands of my family pride.\"  Lady Usk feels shocked, but she does not like to show it, because it is so old-fashioned and prudish and _arrir_ nowadays to be shocked at anything.  \"I have thought about it very often, I assure you,\" continues Brandolin, \"and sometimes I have really thought that I would marry a high-caste Hindoo woman. They are very beautiful, and their forms far more exquisite than any European's, wholly uncramped as they are by any stays, and accustomed to spend so many hours on all kinds of arts for the embellishment of the skin.\"  \"I don't think, you know,\" Lady Usk interposes, hastily, to repress more reminiscences, \"that you need be afraid of the young girls of our time being innocent: they are _veilles_ enough, heaven knows, and experienced enough in all conscience.\"  \"Oh, but that is odious,\" says Brandolin, with disgust. \"The girls of the day are horrible; nothing is unknown to them; they smoke, they gamble, they flirt without decency or grace, their one idea is to marry for sake of a position which will let them go as wild as they choose, and for the sake of heaps of money which will sustain their unconscionable extravagance. Lord deliver me from any of them! I would sooner see St. Hubert's Lea cut up into allotment-grounds than save it from the Southesk-Vanes by marrying a _dbutante_ with her mind fixed on establishing herself, and her youthful memories already full of dead-and-gone flirtations. No! let me wait for Dodo, if you will give me permission to educate her.\"  \"Dodo will never be educated out of flirting; she is born for it,\" says her father, \"and she will be a handful when she gets into society. I am afraid you would return her to us and sigh for your high-caste Hindoo.\"  \"Pray, how would you educate her? what is missing in her present education?\" asks Lady Usk, somewhat piqued at what he implies.  \"I would let her see a great deal more of her mother than she is allowed to do,\" says Brandolin: \"where could she take a better model?\" he adds, with a bow of much grace.  Her mother is not sure whether she ought to be flattered or offended. Brandolin has a way of mingling graceful compliments and implied censure with so much skill and intricacy that to disentangle them is difficult for those whom he would at once flatter and rebuff. \"One never quite knows what he means,\" she thinks, irritably. \"I do believe he intends to imply that I neglect my children!\"  Brandolin seems to her an unpleasant man, eccentric, discourteous, and immoral. She cannot imagine what George or the world sees to admire and like so much in him.  \"Lord Brandolin actually declares that black women have much better figures than we have,\" she says, an hour later, to Leila Faversham.  \"Black women!\" exclaims that lady, in unspeakable horror.  \"Well, Hindoos: it is the same thing,\" says Lady Usk with that ignorance of her Indian fellow-subjects which is characteristic of English society, from the highest strata to the lowest.  \"Oh, he is always so odd, you know,\" says Mrs. Faversham, as of a person whom it is hopeless even to discuss. Brandolin is indeed so odd that he has never perceived her own attractions. What can seem odder to a pretty woman than that?  Leila Faversham tells Lady Dawlish ten minutes later that Brandolin has confessed that he only likes black women. \"Isn't it horrid? He actually has numbers of them down in Warwickshire, just as he keeps the Indian animals and the African birds.\"  \"How very shocking!\" says Lady Dawlish. \"But I dare say it is very economical: they only eat a spoonful of rice and wear a yard of calico, you know, and, as he is poor, that must suit him.\"  Lady Dawlish tells this fact to Nina Curzon, adding various embellishments of her fancy; Mrs. Curzon thinks the notion new and amusing; she writes of it that morning to a journal of society which she occasionally honors with news of her world, not from want of the editor's fee, but from the amusement it affords her to destroy the characters of her acquaintances. The journal will immediately, she knows, produce a mysterious but sensational paragraph regarding the black women in Warwickshire, or some article headed \"An Hereditary Legislature at Home.\" Brandolin is a person whom it is perfectly safe to libel: he is very indolent, very contemptuous, and he never by any chance reads a newspaper.  \"An extremely interesting woman,\" muses Brandolin that evening, as he dresses for dinner. \"Interesting, and moreover with something original, something mysterious and suggestive, in her. Despite Lady Usk, there is a difference still in different nationalities. I could still swear to an Englishwoman anywhere, if I only saw the back of her head and her shoulders. No Englishwoman could have the delicious languor of Madame Sabaroff's movements.\"  She interests him; he decides to stay on at Surrenden.  When he sees her at dinner he is still more favorably impressed.  Her figure is superb, and her sleeveless gown shows the beauty of her bust and arms; she has a flat band of diamonds worn between the elbow and the shoulder of the right arm. The effect is singular, but good.  \"It is to show that she has the muscle above the elbow,\" says old Sir Adolphus, who is learned in sculpture and anatomy. \"You know, not one woman in ten thousand has it; and for want of it their arms fall in above the elbow. I have heard sculptors say so a hundred times. She has it, and so she wears that flat bracelet to emphasize the fact.\"  Brandolin feels annoyed. There is no reason in life why he should object to Madame Sabaroff having any number of affectations and vanities, or why he should mind hearing this handsome old _viveur_ discuss them; but he is annoyed by both facts.  There is not a plain woman among the guests of Surrenden: some are even far beyond the average of good looks, and all have that _chic_ which lends in itself a kind of beauty to the woman of the world. But the handsomest of them all, Nina Curzon herself, pales beside the beautiful pallor of the Russian lady, contrasted as it is with the splendor of her jewels, the red rose of her lips, and the darkness of her eyelashes and eyes.  At dinner, Xenia Sabaroff does not speak much: she has a dreamy look, almost a fatigued one.  Brandolin is opposite to her: as there are no ornaments or flowers on the table higher than eight inches, he can contemplate her at his leisure across the field of shed rose-leaves which is between them. Finding that she is so silent, he talks in his best fashion, in his most reckless, antithetical, picturesque manner: he perceives he gains her attention, though he never directly addresses her.  He also makes Mr. Wootton furious. Mr. Wootton has half a dozen good stories untold. His method of getting good stories is ingenious: he procures obscure but clever memoirs, French and English, which are wholly forgotten, alters their most piquant anecdotes a little, and fits them on to living and famous personages; the result is admirable, and has earned him his great reputation as a _raconteur_ of contemporary scandal. He has six delicious things ready now, and he cannot find a moment in which he can lead up to and place any one of them.  \"Brandolin is so amusing when he likes,\" says Lady Arthur Audley, incautiously, to this suppressed and sullen victim.  \"A monologist! a monologist!\" replies Mr. Wootton, with a deprecatory accent.  Lady Arthur is silenced, for she has not the slightest idea what a monologist is. She fancies it means some kind of a sect like the Mormons, and Brandolin is so odd that he may possibly belong to a sect, or may have founded one, like Laurence Oliphant. She remembers the black women that they talked of, and does not like to ask, being a sensitive person, very delicate-minded, and perfectly proper, except her one little affair with Sir Hugo, which everybody says is most creditable to her, Arthur Audley being the scamp that he is.  Dinner over, Brandolin finds a pleasant seat on a low chair behind the bigger chair on which Madame Sabaroff is reclining; other men devoted to other women look longingly at her, some approach; Brandolin comprehends why she is not beloved in her generation by her own sex.  After a time she is induced to sing; she has a very sweet voice, of great power, with much pathos in it; she sings volkslieder of her own country, strange yearning wistful songs, full of the vague mystical melancholy of the Russian peasant. She ceases abruptly, and walks back to her seat; her diamonds gleam in the light like so many eyes of fire. Brandolin has listened in silence, conscious of a troubled pleasure within himself, which is invariably the herald of one of those attachments which have so often at once embellished and disturbed his existence.  Like all romantic people, his heart is much younger than his years. It has not been scarred by any one of those tragic passions which, like fire on a hill-side, wither up all green things, so that not a blade of grass will grow where it has passed. He has usually found love only the most agreeable of pastimes. He has always wondered why anybody allowed it to tear their life to tatters, as a bad actor tears a fine piece of blank verse. An uncle of his possessed an Aphrodite in Paphian marble which had been dug up in a vineyard at Luna, and a work of great beauty of the second period of Greek art. A lover of pleasure, but withal a philosopher, his uncle treasured and adored this statue, and whenever he felt that any living woman was getting more power over him than he liked, he compared her in his mind with the Luna Venus, and found that the human creature's defects outbalanced her charms, and thus reduced the potency of the latter to more reasonable dimensions.  Instead of his uncle's Luna goddess, Brandolin keeps in some remote and sealed-up nook of his mind a certain ideal; now and then he remembers it, takes it out and looks at it, and it has usually served with him at such moments the purpose which the Luna marble served with his uncle.  As he saunters towards the smoking-room with his hands in the pockets of a loose velvet jacket, he summons this useful resident of his brain, intending to banish with it the remembrance, the too enervating remembrance, of Xenia Sabaroff. But, to his surprise, they seem very like one another, and their features blend confusedly into one.  \"And I know nothing at all about this lady, except that she has a voice like Albani's, big jewels, and a Russian name!\" he thinks, with some derision of himself. The smokers do not find him amusing, while his companions seem to him insufferably tiresome. He hears the echo of Madame Sabaroff's grave, low, melodious voice, and is not in temper for the somewhat _scabreux_ jests of the smoking-room. He thinks that it is all very well for boys to like that sort of salacious talk, but it seems to him intolerably absurd that men of his own age, and older, should find any kind of savor in it.  They tease him about the black women, moreover, and for once he is not easy enough to be good-tempered and indifferent. He answers contemptuously and irritably, and of course all his friends suppose, which they had not supposed before, that there is, after all, some truth in Mrs. Curzon's anecdote.  \"What stupid stories that old _blagueur_ Wootton has told in the smoking-room, and what beastly ones Fred Ormond has related! and all as if they were something new, too! as if the one weren't taken out of the manuscripts at Bute House, and the other out of last week's 'Figaro'! If men won't be original, or can't be, why don't they hold their tongues?\"  \"What fools we are to sit shut up with gas-lights and tobacco on such a night as this!--a night for Lorenzo and Jessica, for Romeo and Juliet,\" he thinks, as he stands awhile at the open window of his own bedroom.  It is three o'clock: there is a faint suggestive light which means the dawn, young birds are twittering, there is a delicious scent of green leaves, of full-blown roses, of dewy mosses; the air is damp and warm, he can hear the feet of blackbirds scraping and turning over the mould and the grass; it is dark, yet he can distinguish the masses of the great woods beyond the gardens, the outlines of the trees near his casement, the shape of the clouds as they move slowly southward. He wonders in what part of the old house, whose fantastic roofs and turrets and gargoyles and ivy-colored buttresses are hidden in the dusk of the summer night, they have given the Princess Sabaroff her chamber. He remains some time at the open window, and goes to his bed as the dawn grows rosy.  \"Lord Brandolin is in a very bad temper,\" says Mr. Wootton, when the smoking-room door has closed on the object of his detestation; then he pauses, and adds, significantly, \"The Brandolins, you know, were always a little--just a little--clever family, very clever, but we all know to what great wits are sadly often allied. And this man has never done anything, with all his talent and opportunities; never done anything at all!\"  \"He has written first-rate books,\" says Usk, angrily, always ready to defend a friend in absence.  \"Oh, books!\" says \"Mr. Wootton, with bland but unutterable disdain. Mr. Wootton is a critic of books, and therefore naturally despises them.  \"What would you have him do?\" growls Usk, pugnaciously.  Mr. Wootton stretches his legs out, and gazes with abstracted air at the ceiling. \"Public life,\" he murmurs. \"Public life is the only possible career for an Englishman of position. But it demands sacrifices; it demands sacrifices.\"  \"You mean that one has to marry?\" says the young Duke of Queenstown, timidly.  Mr. Wootton smiles on him loftily. \"Marry? yes, undoubtedly; and avoid scandals afterwards; avoid, beyond all, those connections which lend such a charm to existence, but are so apt to get into the newspapers.\"  There is a general laugh.  Mr. Wootton has not intended to make them laugh, and he resumes, with stateliness, as though they had not interrupted him. \"The country expects those sacrifices: no man succeeds in public life in England who does not make them.\"  \"Melbourne, Palmerston, Sidney Herbert?\" murmurs one rebellious hearer.  Mr. Wootton waves him aside as he would do an importunate fly. \"Not to touch on living persons, I would select Lord Althorp as the model of the public leader most suited to this country. It would not suit Lord Brandolin to lead the blameless life of Lord Althorp. It would not suit him even to pretend to lead it. I doubt if he could even look the part, if he tried. The English are a peculiar people; they always mix public and private life together. Lord Beaconsfield remarked to me once----\"  And Mr. Wootton tells a story of Disraeli, a very good story, only he has taken it out of the journals of the Prsident des Brosses and fathered it on to Disraeli. But M. le Prsident des Brosses is an author seldom read now, and nobody knows; if they did, nobody would care.  \"Public opinion,\" he resumes, \"is irresistible in England; and if it once turn against a man, were he Messiah himself, he could do nothing. It is not an intelligent public opinion: it confuses public and private qualifications. A man may be a great statesman and yet dislike his wife and like somebody else's. A man may be a great hero and yet may have an unseemly passion or an unpaid tailor. But the British public does not understand this. It invariably overlooks the man's greatness, and only sees the lady or the tailor who compromises him. It thinks--unhappily or happily, as you please to consider--that genius should keep the whole ten commandments. Now, genius is conspicuous for breaking them.\"  Mr. Wootton here knocks a little ash off his cigar, and smiles like a man who has said something neatly.  \"It is the first time I ever heard you compliment genius,\" murmurs Lawrence Hamilton.  \"In Italy,\" pursues Mr. Wootton, \"not very long ago a minister was accused of buying a piano out of the public funds for his mistress. Neither the piano nor the mistress hurt the gentleman in public estimation in that soft and accommodating clime. But that piano, though he might have paid for it with own money, would have ruined an English politician. Though it had been the very smallest cottage piano conceivable, it would have buried him forever under it if it had got talked about; he would never have explained it away, or made it even contingently endurable to the nation. You may, if you are a public man in England, commit every conceivable blunder, add millions to the national debt, eat your own words every evening in debate, and plunge the country into an abyss of unmeasured and unmeasurable revolution, and they will still have confidence in you if you read the lessons in church and walk home with your wife; but if it is ever rumored that you admire your neighbor's wife, down you go forever. And yet,\" continues Mr. Wootton, pensively, \"people _do_ admire their neighbor's wife in England, and it seems a venial offence when one compares it with the desertion of Gordon, or the encouragement of a hydra-headed greed for the rich man's goods.\"  With which Mr. Wootton yawns, rises, and also declares his intention to go to bed.  The young duke follows him and walks by his side down the corridor. He is not at all like Disraeli's young duke: he is awkward, shy, and dull, he is neither amiable nor distinguished, but he has a painstaking wish in him to do well by his country, which is almost noble in a person who has been toadied, indulged, and tempted in all ways and on all sides ever since his cradle days. It is the disinterested patriotism which has been so largely the excellence and honor of the English nobility, and which is only possible in men of position so high that they are raised by it from birth above all vulgar covetousness or pecuniary needs.  \"Do you really think?\" says the duke, timidly, for he is very afraid of Henry Wootton,--\"do you really think that to have any influence on English public life it is necessary--necessary--to keep so very straight, as regards women, I mean, you know?\"  \"It is most necessary to _appear_ to keep very straight,\" replies Mr. Wootton. The two things are obviously different to the meanest capacity.  The young man sighs.  \"And to have that--that--appearance, one must be married?\"  \"Indisputably. Marriage is as necessary to respectability in any great position as a brougham to a doctor, or a butler to a bishop,\" replies the elder, smiling compassionately at the wick of his candle. He does not care a straw about the duke: he has no daughters to marry, and Mr. Wootton's social eminence is far beyond the power of dukes or princes to make or mend.  \"But,\" stammers his Grace of Queenstown, growing red, yet burning with a desire for instruction, \"but don't you think a--a connection with--with any lady of one's own rank is quite safe, quite sure not to cause scandal?\"  Mr. Wootton balances his candlestick carefully on one finger, pauses in his walk, and looks hard at his questioner.  \"That would depend entirely upon the lady's temper,\" replies this wise monitor of youth.  They are words of wisdom so profound that they sink deep into the soul of his pupil, and fill him with a consternated sadness and perplexity. The temper of Lady Dawlish is a known quantity, and the quality of it is alarming. Lady Dawlish is not young, she is good-looking, and she has debts. Lord Dawlish has indeed hitherto let her pay her debts in any way she chose, being occupied enough with paying such of his own as he cannot by any dexterity avoid; but there is no knowing what he may do any day out of caprice or ill nature, and, although he will never obtain a divorce, he may try for one, which will equally effectually convulse the duke's county and the cathedral city which is situated in its centre. His own affair with Lady Dawlish is, he firmly believes, known to no human being save themselves and their confidential servants: he little dreams that it has been the gossip of all London until London grew tired of it; he is indeed aware that everybody invited them in the kindest manner together, but he attributed this coincidence to her tact in the management of her set and choice of her own engagements.  The human mind is like the ostrich: its own projects serve to it the purpose which sand plays to the ostrich: comfortably buried in them, it defies the scrutiny of mankind; wrapped in its own absorbing passions, it leaves its hansom before a lady's hall door, or leaves its coroneted handkerchief on a bachelor's couch, and never dreams that the world is looking on round the corner or through the keyhole. Human nature the moment it is interested becomes blind. Therefore the duke has put his question in good faith.  He would abhor any kind of scandal. He is devoted to his mother, who is a pious and very proper person; he has a conscientious sense of his own vast duties and responsibilities; he would feel most uncomfortable if he thought people were talking grossly of him in his own county; and he has a horror of Lord Dawlish, noisy, insolent, coarse, a gambler and a rake.  Arrived at his bedroom door, Mr. Wootten is touched vaguely with a kind feeling towards his humble interrogator, or with some other sentiment less kindly, it may be. He pauses, looks straight before him at the wick of his candle, and speaks with that oracular air so becoming to him which many ungrateful people are known to loathe.  \"That kind of connections are invariably dangerous; invariably,\" he remarks. \"They have their uses, I admit, they have their uses: they mould a man's manners when he is young, they enable him to acquire great insight into female character, they keep him out of the lower sorts of entanglements, and they are useful in restraining him from premature marriage. But they are perilous if allowed to last too long. If permitted to claim privileges, rights, usurpations, they are apt to become irksome and compromising, especially if the lady be no longer young. When a woman is no longer young there is a desperate _acharnement_ in her tenacity about a last passion which is like that of the mariner clinging to a spar in the midst of a gusty sea. It is not easy for the spar to disengage itself. On the whole, therefore, women of rank are perhaps best avoided in this sense. Passions are safest which can be terminated by the cheque-book. The cheque-book is not always indeed refused by great ladies,--when they are in debt,--but a cheque-book is an unpleasant witness in the law courts. However, as I said before, all depends on the lady's temper: no woman who has a bad temper is ever truly discreet. Good-night to your Grace.\" And Mr. Wootton, with his candle, disappears within his door-way.  He smiles a little blandly as his man undresses him. Five years before, Lady Dawlish offended him at a house-party at Sandringham, taking a fiendish pleasure in capping all his best stories and tracing the sources of all his epigrams. In that inaccessible but indelible note-book, his memory, he has written her name down as that of one to whom he has a debt to pay. \"_Je lui ai donn du fil  retordre_,\" he thinks, as he drops into his first doze.     CHAPTER VIII.   \"Alan is really coming to day!\" says Dorothy Usk to her lord, with pleasure, a few days later, looking up from a telegram.  \"How you excite yourself!\" says Usk, with rude disdain. \"What can you see to care about? He is a pretentious humbug, if ever there was one!\"  \"George!\" She regards him with horror and amaze. Is he wholly out of his mind? Her cousin is Lady Usk's ideal of what an English gentleman should be. _He_ does not keep black women down in Warwickshire.  \"A pretentious humbug,\" repeats Usk. He likes to ticket his relations and connections with well-chosen descriptions. \"All good looks and soft sawder. Women like that sort of thing----\"  \"Of course we like good manners, though they are not your weakness,\" interrupts his wife, with acerbity. \"Alan has the manners of a man who respects women: that may seem very tame to you and your friend Brandolin, but in these days it has at least the charm of novelty.\"  \"Respects women!\" Usk is unable to restrain his hilarity. \"My dear Dolly, you're not a chicken: you can't mean that you don't know that Gervase----\"  \"I know that he is well-bred. You were so once, but it is a very long time ago,\" replies his wife, with cutting sententiousness, and with that unkind reply she leaves him. As if she did not understand men better than he, she thinks, contemptuously. He may understand dogs and horses, and deer and partridges, but about human nature he knows no more than the old man at the lodge gates.  \"Surely she can't be soft on Gervase herself?\" her husband reflects, with a sensation of amusement; \"it would be too funny, after running so straight all these years, and just as her daughters are growing up; but they often are like that.\"  He is not sure whether the idea diverts or irritates him, but he knows that he has always detested Gervase, such a coxcomb and such a humbug as the fellow is!  \"Respect women, good Lord!\" ejaculates Usk in his solitude.  \"To be sure,\" adds that honest gentleman in his own mind, \"there are very few of 'em who would thank you to respect 'em nowadays.\"  \"Gervase will be here by dinner,\" he says in the course of the day to Princess Sabaroff.  \"Indeed,\" she replies, with indifference. \"Who is he?\"  \"A friend of my wife's; at least, a cousin. I thought you might know him; he was some time in Russia.\"  \"No,\"--and there is a coldness in the negative disproportioned to so simple a denial,--\"I do not think so. I do not remember such a name. Who is he?\"  \"A person who is expected to be great in foreign affairs some day or other,\" says Brandolin. \"He will have one qualification rare in an English foreign minister,--daily growing rarer, thanks to the imbecilities of examinations: he knows how to bow and he knows what to say.\"  \"A friend of yours?\"  \"Oh, no; an acquaintance. He thinks very ill of me.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Because I do nothing for my country. He thinks he does a great deal when he has fomented a quarrel or received a decoration.\"  \"That is not generous. The world owes much to diplomatists: it will know how much in a few years, when it will be governed by clerks controlled by telephones.\"  \"That is true: I stand corrected. But Gervase and I have few sympathies: none, indeed, except politically, and even there we differ,--his is the Toryism of Peel, mine is the Toryism of the late Lord Derby: there are leagues between the two.\"  \"I know: the one is opportunism; the other is optimate-ism.\"  \"Perhaps,\" says Brandolin, with a smile, and thinks, meantime, \"She knows something about him. What is it?\"  \"Does she know Gervase, despite her denial?\" he wonders. He has an impression that she does. There was a look of recognition in her eyes when she gave that vague bland gesture in answer to her host. All trifles in her interest him, as they always do interest a man in a woman whom he admires and is not sure that he understands; and Gervase he is aware has been a good deal in Russia.  He himself has known the subject of their discourse ever since they were boys, and had that sort of intimacy with him which exists between men who live in the same sets and belong to the same clubs. But to him Gervase seems a _petit-matre_, a _poseur_, a man artificial, conventional, ambitious in small things, and to Gervase he himself seems much as he does to Lady Usk, a perverse and lawless Bohemian, only saved from the outer darkness by the fact of his aristocratic birth.  Meanwhile, in her own room, Xenia Sabaroff is pursuing her own reflections whilst her maid disrobes her.  \"It will be better to see him once and for all,\" she muses. \"I cannot go on forever avoiding him in every city in Europe. Very likely he will not even remember my face or my name.\"  She feels a strong temptation to invent some plausible reason and break off her visit to Surrenden; but she is a courageous woman, and flight is repugnant to her. More than once of late she has avoided a meeting which is disagreeable to her, by some abrupt change of her own plans or reversal of her own engagements. To continue to do this seems weakness. Indeed, to do it at all seems too great a flattery to the person avoided. What is painful is best encountered without procrastination. It is the old question of grasping the nettle.  A haughty flush passes over her face at her own reflections. After all, to have any emotion at all about it, pleasurable or painful, is humiliation. She is a proud woman, as well as a courageous one. There are memories associated with this coming guest which are bitter and hateful.  Women like Mrs. Wentworth Curzon carry such memories lightly, or rather do not carry them at all, but bury them by scores, pell-mell, one on the top of another, like old letters, and forget all about their interment; but she is different from them.  It has not been difficult for her to avoid meeting Lord Gervase; he is one of those persons whose movements are known and chronicled; but she is conscious that the time is come when she can no longer escape doing so, except by such an abrupt departure that it would seem to herself too great a weakness, and be to him too great a flattery, for such a step to enter for an instant into the category of possibilities. It is, she reflects, or it should be, a matter to her of absolute indifference to see again a person whom she has not seen for seven years.  Yet she is conscious of a sense of pain and excitation as her woman puts on her a maize satin tea-gown covered with point d'Alenon at five o'clock the next day, and she knows that when she goes down to the room in a few minutes Gervase, who was to arrive by the afternoon train, will in all probability be present there.  Every one is in-doors that day, for a fine summer rain is falling without, and has been falling since noon. All the house-party are in the library, and the children are there also; the windows are open, and the sweet smell from the damp gardens and wet grass fills the air.  Every one is laughing and talking; Usk is drinking a glass of kmmel, and Brandolin is playing with the dog; conversing with Nina Curzon and the mistress of the house, and standing in front of them, is a tall fair man irreproachable in _tenue_ and extremely distinguished in appearance. He is Lord Gervase. His back is towards the door, and he does not see or hear her enter, but as the Babe rushes towards her, toppling over a stool and treading mercilessly on the trains of tea-gowns in the wind of his going, the noise made by the child makes him turn his head, and an expression of recognition mingled with amazement passes over his usually impassive features.  \"Is that not Princess Sabaroff?\" he asks of his hostess, with a certain breathless astonishment betrayed in his voice.  Lady Usk assents. \"One of my dearest friends,\" she adds. \"I think you don't know her? I will present you in a moment. She is as clever as she is beautiful. The children adore her. Look at Babe.\"  The Babe has dragged his princess to a couch and climbed up on it himself, kneeling half on her lap and half off it, with no respect for the maize satin, whilst his impatient little feet beat the devil's tatoo among the point d'Alenon.  \"My dear Babe, do not be such a monopolist,\" says Brandolin, as he approaches with a cup of tea and a wafer of caviare bread-and-butter. \"Your shoes have seventeenth-century buckles, it is true, yet still they are scarcely _bibelots_ to be wrapped up in a lady's dress.\"  The Babe grins saucily, tossing his hair out of his eyes; but, with unwonted obedience, he disentangles his feet with some care out of the lace.  Xenia Sabaroff does not take as much notice of him as usual. She is reserved and preoccupied. Brandolin, like the child, fails in awakening her interest or attention. She has seated herself almost with her back to where Gervase is standing, but every now and then she looks half round, as by an irresistible unconscious impulse of curiosity.  Brandolin notes the gesture, as her actions have an interest for him which grows daily in its fascination. \"There is Dorothy Usk's Ph[oe]nix,\" he says to her, in a low tone, when the Babe has scampered off after bon-bons: he indicates Gervase with a glance. Her eyebrows contract slightly, as in some displeasure or constraint.  \"Lady Usk is very soon satisfied,\" she replies, coldly. \"Her own amiability makes her see perfection everywhere.\"  \"It is a quality we cannot value too highly in so imperfect a world. It is better than seeing everything _en noir_, surely?\" says Brandolin. \"If we make people what we think them, as optimists say, it is best to be optimistic.\"  \"I dislike optimism,\" she says, curtly. \"It is absurd and untrue. Our Dostoievsky is a wiser novelist than your Dickens. One must believe something,\" she says.  \"It is pretty for a woman to think so,\" says Brandolin, \"but myself I have never seen why. I may hope, I may wish, I may regret, I may--if I am very sanguine--even expect; but believe--no!\"  \"Perhaps I should like to believe in a woman,\" he adds, more softly, with that inflection of his voice which has always had at all events the effect of making women believe in him.  Madame Sabaroff is not so easily touched as many. She pauses a moment, then says, with a certain weariness, \"Anybody who can believe can love: that is nothing new.\"  \"What would be new? To love and disbelieve in what we love? It would be very painful.\"  \"It would be a test,\" says his companion.  Then she drops the subject decidedly, by approaching the other ladies. Brandolin has a faint sense of discomfiture and sadness: he is accustomed to very facile conquests; and yet he is not a coxcomb, like Lawrence Hamilton; he did not precisely anticipate one here, but habit is second nature, and it has been his habit to succeed with women with rapidity and ease. That sense of mystery which there is also for him in the Princess Xenia oppresses whilst it allures him. He is English enough to think that he dislikes mystery, yet as an element of romance it has always an irresistible fascination for romantic temperaments.  Gervase meanwhile has sunk into a chair by the side of Nina Curzon, and is saying, in a whisper, \"Who is that lady? The one with her back to us, to whom Lord Brandolin is so _empress_? I thought that I knew all the Usks' people.\"  \"Look in your Russian memories, and you will probably find that you know her too,\" replies Mrs. Curzon.  \"Oh, she is Russian?\" says Gervase, then adds, negligently, \"I think, now you tell me that, I have seen her before. Is she not the Princess Sabaroff?\"  \"Why did you pretend not to know her?\" thinks Nina Curzon as she answers, \"Yes, that is her name. You must have met her in Petersburg.\"  \"Petersburg is very dim in my memories,\" he replies, evasively. \"Its baccarat is what made the deepest impression on my remembrance and my fortunes. Now I think of it, however, I recollect her quite well: her husband was Anatole Sabaroff, and Lustoff shot him in a duel about her? Am I right?\"  \"So charming for her!\" says Nina Curzon. \"Englishwomen never have anything happen for them picturesque like that: our men always die of indigestion, or going after a fox.\"  \"It is very curious.\"  \"What is? Dyspepsia? Hunting?\"  \"How one comes across people.\"  \"'After long years,'\" quotes Mrs. Curzon, with mock romance in her tones. \"Generally, I think,\" she adds, with a little yawn, \"we can never get rid of our people, the world is so small, and there is really only one set in it that is decent, so we can't ever get out of it. It must have been very nice in Romeo and Juliet's days, when a little drive to Mantua took you into realms wholly inaccessible to your Verona acquaintances. Nowadays, if you run away from anybody in London you are sure to run against them in Yeddo or Yucatan.\"  \"Constancy made easy, like the three R's,\" says Gervase. \"Unfortunately, despite our improved facilities, we are not constant.\"  \"He means to imply that he threw over the Sabaroff,\" thinks Mrs. Curzon; \"but he is such a boaster of his _bonnes fortunes_ that one can never know whether he is lying.\"  \"Pray let me make you known to Madame Sabaroff,\" says Lady Usk to him, a little later. \"She is such a very dear friend of mine, and I see you have been looking at her ever since she entered the room.\"  \"She is a very handsome person: any one would look at her,\" replies her cousin. Were he not so perfectly well-bred and impassive, it might almost be said that the suggested presentation fills him with some vague nervousness.  Nina Curzon watches him inquisitively as he is led up and presented to Madame Sabaroff.  \"I think I have had the honor before now, in Petersburg,\" murmurs Gervase. She looks at him very coldly.  \"I think not,\" she replies. The words are of the simplest, but _c'est le ton qui fait la musique_, and, for the solitary time in his existence, Lord Gervase is embarrassed.  Brandolin, playing with the colley dog near at hand, listens and observes.  Lady Usk is not so observant. \"It is a long time since he was in Russia,\" she says to her friend, \"I dare say you have forgotten. His father was alive, and his name was Baird then, you know.\"  Xenia Sabaroff makes a little polite gesture expressive of entire indifference to the change in these titles. With an action which would be rude in any woman less high-bred, she turns away her head and speaks to Brandolin, ignoring the acquaintance and the presence of Gervase.  Across the good-natured and busy brain of her hostess there flashes an electric and odious thought: is it possible that Usk may be right, and that there may be something wrong, after all, in this her latest and most adored friend? She feels that she will die of suffocated curiosity if she do not speedily get her cousin alone and learn all he has ever known or heard of the Princess Sabaroff.  \"A snub direct!\" whispers Lawrence Hamilton to Mr. Wootton.  \"Or a cut direct: which?\" says that far-sighted gentleman.  \"Anyhow, it's delightful to see him let in for it,\" reflects Usk, who has also observed the incident from where he stands by the liqueurs.  Gervase, who has never been known to be at a loss in any position, however difficult, colors and looks at once annoyed and confused. He stands before Xenia Sabaroff for a few moments hesitating and irresolute, conscious that every one is looking at him; then he takes refuge with Lady Dawlish, whom he detests, because she is the nearest person to him.  \"Madame Sabaroff is eclipsing the black women,\" says that lady.  \"What black women?\" asks Gervase, very inattentive and bored. She tells him the story of the Hindoo harem, and he hears no word of it.  \"Brandolin is always so odd,\" he says, indifferently, watching the hand of Xenia Sabaroff as it rests on the shoulder of the Babe, who is leaning against her knees gazing at her adoringly.  Gervase is angered; irritated, interested, and mortified all at once. He has never been in an absurd position before, and he is aware that he was in one a moment ago, and that the whole house-party of Surrenden Court saw him in it. \"What a fool Dolly was not to tell me she was here!\" he thinks, forgetting that his cousin and hostess has not the remotest suspicion that he and the Princess Xenia have ever met each other before.  \"Seven years!\" he thinks. \"Good heavens! what an eternity! And she is handsomer than she was then; very handsome; wonderfully handsome.\"  He looks at her all the while from under his half-closed eyelids, whilst he talks he knows not what kind of rubbish to Lady Dawlish.  Xenia Sabaroff does not once look his way. The moment which she had dreaded has passed, and it has made no impression whatever upon her: her indifference reconciles her to herself. Is it possible, she wonders, that she ever loved, or ever thought that she loved, this man?  \"Why will you always treat me as a stranger, Madame Sabaroff?\" murmurs Gervase to her that night when for a moment he is alone near her, while the cotillion overture commences.  \"You are a stranger--to me,\" replies Xenia Sabaroff; and as she speaks she looks full at him.  He colors with discomfiture. \"Because in the due course of nature I have succeeded to my father's title, you seem to consider that I have changed my whole identity,\" he says, with great irritation.  She is silent; she looks down on the white ostrich-feathers of her fan. He is vaguely encouraged by that silence. \"Strangers! That is surely a very cold and cruel word between those who once were friends?\"  The direct appeal to her makes her look up once more, with great _hauteur_ in the coldness of her face.  \"Sir, I think when people have forgotten that each other exist, it is as though they had never met. They are perhaps something more distant still than strangers, for to strangers friendship in the future is possible; but those who have been separated by oblivion on the one hand and by contempt on the other are parted as surely and eternally as though death had divided them.\"  Gervase gathers some solace from the very strength of the words. She would not, he thinks, feel so strongly unless she felt more than he allows: he gazes at her with feigned humility and unfeigned admiration and regret.  \"If Madame Sabaroff,\" he murmurs, \"can doubt her own powers of compelling remembrance, she is the one person on earth only who can do so.\"  She is stung to anger.  \"I am really at loss to decide whether you are intentionally insolent or unintentionally insincere. You are possibly both.\"  \"I am neither. I am only a man who passionately and uselessly rebels against his fate.\"  \"Who regrets his own actions, you mean to say. That is nothing uncommon.\"  \"Well, who regrets the past, if you will put it so, and who would atone for it would you allow him.\"  \"Atone! Do you suppose that you owe me reparation? It is I who owe you thanks for a momentary oblivion which did me immeasurable service.\"  \"That is a very harsh doctrine. The Princess Xenia whom I knew was neither so stern nor so sceptical.\"  \"The Princess Xenia whom you knew was a child, a foolish child; she is dead, quite as much dead as though she were under so many solid square feet of Baltic ice. Put her from your thoughts: you will never awake her.\"  Then she rises and leaves him and goes out of the ball-room.  Throughout that evening he does not venture to approach her again, and he endeavors to throw himself with some show of warmth into a flirtation with Nina Curzon.  \"Why did you pretend not to know her?\" says Mrs. Curzon to him.  He smiles, the fatuous smile with which a man ingeniously expresses what he would be thought a brute to put into words.  \"She does not deign to know me--now,\" he says, modestly, and to the experienced comprehension of Nina Curzon the words, although so modest, tell her as much as the loudest boast could do.     CHAPTER IX.   Gervase saunters in to his hostess's boudoir the next morning, availing himself of the privilege accorded to that distant relationship which it pleases them both to raise into an intimate cousinship. It is a charming boudoir, style Louis Quinze, with the walls hung with flowered silk of that epoch, and the dado made of fans which belonged to the same period. Lady Usk writes here at a little secrtaire painted by Fragonard, and uses an inkstand said to have belonged to Madame de Parabre, made in the shape of a silver shell driven by a gold Cupidon; yet, despite the frivolity of these associations, she contrives to get through a vast mass of business at this fragile table, and has one of the soundest heads for affairs in all England. Gervase sits down and makes himself agreeable, and relates to her many little episodes of his recent experiences.  She is used to be the confidante of her men; she is young enough to make a friend who is attractive to them, and old enough to lend herself _de bon c[oe]ur_ to the recital of their attachments to other women. Very often she gives them very good advice, but she does not obtrude it unseasonably. \"An awfully nice woman all round,\" is the general verdict of her visitants to the boudoir. She does not seek to be more than that to them.  Gervase does not make any confidences: he only tells her things which amuse her and reveal much about her acquaintances, nothing about himself. He smokes some of her favorite cigarettes, praises some new china, suggests an alteration in the arrangement of the fans, and makes critical discourses _ propos_ of her collection of snuff-boxes.  When he is going away, he lingers a moment intently looking at a patch-box of vernis Martin, and says, with studied carelessness, \"Dolly, tell me, when did you make the acquaintance of Madame Sabaroff?\"  \"Last year, at Cannes: why do you want to know? She came and stayed with us at Orme last Easter. Is she not perfectly charming?\"  \"Very good-looking,\" says Gervase, absently. \"You don't know anything about her, then?\"  \"Know?\" repeats his hostess. \"What should I know? What everybody does, I suppose. I met her first at the Duchesse de Luynes'. You can't possibly mean that there can be anything--anything----\"  \"Oh, no,\" replies Gervase; but it produces on his questioner the same effect as if he had said, \"Oh, yes.\"  \"How odious men are! such scandal-mongers,\" says Lady Usk, angrily. \"Talk of _our_ 'damning with faint praise' There is nothing comparable to the way in which a man destroys a woman's reputation just by raising his eyebrows or twisting his moustache.\"  \"I have no moustache to twist, and am sure there is no reputation which I wish to destroy,\" says her cousin.  \"Then why do you ask me where I made her acquaintance?\"  \"My dear Dolly! Surely the most innocent and general sort of question ever on the lips of any human being!\"  \"Possibly; not in the way you said it, however; and when one knows that you were a great deal in Russia, it suggests five hundred things,--five thousand things: and of course one knows he was shot in a duel about her, and I believe people have talked.\"  \"I have never helped them to talk. When do they not talk?\"  And beyond this she cannot prevail upon him to go: he pretends that the Princess Sabaroff is beyond all possibility of any approach of calumny, but the protestation produces on her the impression that he could tell her a great deal wholly to the contrary if he chose.  \"She certainly was staying with Madame de Luynes,\" she insists.  \"Who ever said the lady might not stay with the Archbishop of Canterbury?\" replies Gervase.  She is irritated and vexed.  Xenia Sabaroff is her idol of the moment, and if her idol were proved human she would be very angry. She reflects that she will have Dodo and the children kept more strictly in the school-room, and not let them wander about over the park as they do with their Russian friend most mornings.  \"One can never be too careful with children of that age,\" she muses, \"and they are terribly _veilles_ already.\"  Dorothy Usk's friendships, though very ardent, are like most friendships which exist in society: they are apt to blow about with every breeze. She is cordial, kind, and in her way sincere; but she is what her husband characterizes as \"weathercocky.\"  Who is not \"weathercocky\" in the world?  Although so tolerant in appearance of naughty people, because it is the fashion to be so, and not to be so looks priggish and dowdy and odd, she never at the bottom of her heart likes her naughty people. She has run very straight herself, as her lord would express it; she has been always much too busy to have time or inclination to be tempted \"off the rails,\" and she has little patience with women who have gone off them; only she never says so, because it would look so goody-goody and stupid, and for fear of looking so she even manages to stifle in her own breast her own antipathy to Dulcia Waverley.  There have been very many martyrs to the sense that they ought to smile at virtue when they hate it, but Dorothy Usk's martyrdom is of a precisely opposite kind: she forces herself to seem to approve the reverse of virtue whilst she detests it. Anything is better, in her creed, than looking odd; and nowadays you do look so odd and so old-fashioned if you make a fuss about anything. Still, in her heart of hearts she feels excessively vexed, because it is quite apparent to her that Gervase knows something very much to the disadvantage of her new acquaintance.  \"George will be so delighted if he finds out that Madame Sabaroff is like all those horrid women he is so fond of,\" she reflects. \"I shall never hear the last of it from him. It will be a standing joke for him the whole of his life.\"  Certainly Madame Sabaroff is letting Brandolin carry on with her more than is altogether proper. True, they are people who may marry each other if they please, but Brandolin is not a man who marries, and his attentions are never likely to take that form. He probably pays so much court to Madame Sabaroff because he has heard that of her which leads him to suppose that his efforts may be _couronn_, as French vaudevillists say, without any thought of marriage.  Lady Usk has always known that he is horribly unprincipled,--more so than even men of his world usually are. That bantering tone of his is odious, she thinks; and he always has it, even on the gravest subjects.  \"What's the row, my lady? You look ruffled!\" inquires Usk, coming into her boudoir with a sheaf of half-opened letters in his hand.  \"There are always things to annoy one,\" she answers, vaguely.  \"It is an arrangement of a prudential Providence to prevent our affections being set on this world,\" replies Usk, piously.  His wife's only comment on this religious declaration is an impatient twist to the tail of her Maltese dog.  Usk proceeds to turn over to her such letters as bore him; they are countable by dozens; the two or three which interest him have been read in the gun-room and put away in an inside pocket.  \"Mr. Bruce could attend to all these,\" she says, looking with some disgust at the correspondence. Bruce is his secretary.  \"He always blunders,\" says Usk.  \"Then change him,\" says his wife; nevertheless she is pleased at the compliment implied to herself.  \"All secretaries are fools,\" says Usk, impartially.  \"Even secretaries of state,\" says Mr. Wootton, who has the _entre_ of the boudoir, and saunters in at that moment. \"I have some news this morning,\" he adds: \"Coltsfoot marries Miss Hoard.\"  \"Never!\" exclaims Dorothy Usk.  \"Perfectly true,\" says Mr. Wootton. \"Both of them staying at Dunrobin, and engagement publicly announced.\"  Lord Coltsfoot is heir to a dukedom; Miss Hoard is the result in bullion of iron-works.  \"Never!\" reiterates Lady Usk. \"It is impossible that he can do such a horrible thing! Why, she has one shoulder higher than the other, and red eyes!\"  \"There are six millions paid down,\" replies Mr. Wootton, sententiously.  \"What the deuce will Mrs. Donnington say?\" asks Usk.  \"One never announces any marriage,\" remarks Mr. Wootton, \"but there is a universal outcry about what will some lady, married long ago to somebody else, say to it. Curious result of supposed monogamy!\"  \"It is quite disgusting!\" says Lady Usk. \"Some of those new people are presentable, but she isn't; and Coltsfoot is so good-looking and so young.\"  \"It is what the French call an '_alliance trs comme il faut_,'\" says Usk, from sheer spirit of contradiction. \"The dukedom is as full of holes as an old tin pot; she tinkers it up with her iron and gold; and I bet you that your friend Worth will manage to cut Lady Coltsfoot's gowns so that one shoulder higher than the other will become all the rage next season.\"  \"Of course you set no store on such a simple thing as happiness,\" says his wife, with acerbity.  \"Happiness? Lord, my dear! Happiness was buried with Strephon and Chloe centuries ago! We are amused or bored, we are successful or unsuccessful, we are popular or unpopular, we are somebody or we are nobody, but we are never either happy or miserable.\"  \"People who have a heart are still both!\"  \"A heart! You mean spoons!\"  \"What a hideous expression! Strephon and Chloe never used that.\"  \"When we have an unfortunate passion now,\" remarks Mr. Wootton, \"we go to Carlsbad. It's only an affair of the liver.\"  \"Or the nerves,\" suggests Usk. \"Flirtation is the proper thing: flirtation never hurts anybody: it's like puff-paste, seltzer water, and Turkish cigarettes.\"  \"Puff-paste may bring on an indigestion when one's too old to eat it!\"  \"There! Didn't I tell you so? She is always saying something about my age. A man is the age that he feels.\"  \"No, a woman is the age that she looks. If you will quote things, quote them properly.\"  \"The age that she looks? That's so very variable. She's twenty when she enters a ball-room at midnight, she's fifty when she comes out at sunrise; she's sixteen when she goes to meet somebody at Hurlingham, she's sixty when she scolds her maid and has a scene with her husband!\"  Lady Usk interrupts him with vivacity: \"And he? Pray, isn't he five-and-twenty when he's in Paris alone, and five-and-ninety when he's grumbling at home?\"  \"Because he's bored at home! Youth is, after all, only good spirits. If you laugh you are young, but your wife don't make you laugh; you pay her bills, and go with her to a state ball, and sit opposite to her at dinner, and when you catch a cold she is always there to say, 'My dear, didn't I tell you so?' but I defy any man living to recall any hour of his existence in which his wife ever made him laugh!\"  \"And yet you wanted me to ask married people together.\"  \"Because I wanted it all to be highly proper and deadly dull. Surrenden has got a sort of reputation of being a kind of Orleans Club.\"  \"And yet you complain of being bored in it!\"  \"One is always bored in one's own house! One can never take in to dinner the person one likes.\"  \"You make up to yourself for the deprivation after dinner!\"  \"My lady's very ruffled to-day,\" says Usk to Mr. Wootton. \"I don't know which of her doves has turned out a fighting-cock.\"  \"That reminds me,\" observes Mr. Wootton. \"I wanted to ask you, did you know that Gervase, when he was Lord Baird, was very much _au mieux_ with Madame Sabaroff? I remember hearing long ago from Russians----\"  Lady Usk interrupts the great man angrily: \"Very much _au mieux_! What barbarous polygot language for a great critic like you! Must you have the assistance of bad grammar in two tongues to take away my friend's reputation?\"  Lord Usk chuckles. \"Reputations aren't taken away so easily; they're very hardy plants nowadays, and will stand a good deal of bad weather.\"  Mr. Wootton is shocked. \"Oh, Lady Usk! Reputation! You couldn't think I meant to imply of any guest of yours--only, you know, he was secretary in Petersburg when he was Lord Baird, and so----\"  \"Well, it doesn't follow that he is the lover of every woman in Petersburg!\"  Mr. Wootton is infinitely distressed. \"Oh, indeed I didn't mean anything of that sort.\"  \"You did mean everything of that sort,\" murmurs his hostess.  \"But, you see, he admired her very much, was constantly with her, and yesterday I saw they didn't speak to each other, so I was curious to know what could be the reason.\"  \"I believe she didn't recognize him.\"  Mr. Wootton smiles. \"Oh, ladies have such prodigious powers of oblivion--and remembrance!\"  \"Yes,\" observes Usk, with complacency: \"the storms of memory sometimes sink into them as if they were sponges, and sometimes glide off them as if they were ducks. It is just as they find it convenient. But Madame Sabaroff can't have been more than a child when Gervase was in Russia.\"  Mr. Wootton smiles again significantly. \"She was married.\"  \"To a brute!\" cries Dorothy Usk.  \"All husbands,\" says Lord Usk, with a chuckle, \"are brutes, and all wives are angels. _C'est imprim!_\"  \"I hope no one will ever call me an angel! I should know at once that I was a bore!\"  \"No danger, my lady: you've no wings on your shoulders, and you've salt on your tongue.\"  \"I'm sure you mean to be odiously rude, but to my taste it's a great compliment.\"  \"My dear Alan,\" says Dorothy Usk, having got him at a disadvantage in her boudoir one-quarter of an hour after luncheon, \"what has there been between you and the Princess Sabaroff? Everybody feels there is something. It is in the air. Indeed, everybody is talking about it. Pray tell me. I am dying to know.\"  Gervase is silent.  \"Everybody in the house is sure of it,\" continues his hostess. \"They don't say so, of course, but they think so. Nina Curzon, who is _mauvaise langue_, pretends even that she knows all the circumstances; and it would seem that they are not very nice circumstances. I really cannot consent to go on in the dark any longer.\"  \"Ask the lady,\" replies Gervase, stiffly.  \"I certainly shall do nothing so ill-bred. You are a man, you are a relation of mine, and I can say things to you I couldn't possibly say to a stranger, which Madame Sabaroff is quite to me. If you won't answer, I shall only suppose that you paid court to her and were 'spun,' as the boys say at the examinations.\"  \"Not at all,\" says Gervase, haughtily.  \"Then tell me the story.\"  He hesitates. \"I don't know whether you will think very well of me if I tell you the truth.\"  \"That you may be sure I shall not. No man ever behaves well where women are in the question.\"  \"My dear Dolly, what unkind exaggeration! If I tell you anything, you will be sure not to repeat what I say? Madame Sabaroff considers me a stranger to her: I am bound to accept her decision on such a point.\"  \"You knew her in Russia?\"  \"Yes; when I was there she was the new beauty at the court. She had been married a year or less to Paul Sabaroff. I had the honor of her friendship at that time; if she withdraws it now I must acquiesce.\"  \"Oh!\"  Lady Usk gives a little sound between a snort and a sigh.  She is annoyed. The gossipers are right, then. She is sorry the children have been so much with their friend, and she is infuriated at the idea of her husband's triumph over her credulity.  \"Oh, pray don't think--don't think for a moment----\" murmurs Gervase; but his cousin understands that it is the conventional compulsory expostulation which every man who is well-bred is bound to make on such subjects.  \"She must have been very young then?\" she says, beating impatiently on her blotting-book with her gold pen.  \"Very young; but such a husband as Paul Sabaroff made is--well, a more than liberal education to any woman, however young. She was sixteen, I think, and very lovely; though she is perhaps handsomer now. I had the honor of her confidence: she was unhappy and _incomprise_; her father had given her hand in discharge of a debt at cards; Sabaroff was a gambler and a brute; at the end of the second winter season he had a violent fit of jealousy, and sent her to his estate on the White Sea----\"  \"Jealousy of you?\"  Gervase bowed.  \"Where she was kept in a state of surveillance scarcely better than absolute imprisonment. I did all manner of crazy and romantic things to endeavor to see her; and once or twice I succeeded; but he had discovered letters of mine, and made her captivity more rigorous than ever. I myself was ordered on the special mission to Spain,--you remember,--and I left Russia with a broken heart. From that time to this I have never seen her.\"  \"But your broken heart has continued to do its daily work?\"  \"It is a figure of speech. I adored her, and the husband was a brute. When Lustoff shot him he only rid the world of a brute. You have seen that broad bracelet she wears above the right elbow? People always talk so about it. She wears it to hide where Sabaroff broke her arm one night in his violence: the marks of it are there forever.\"  Lady Usk is silent: she is divided between her natural compassion and sympathy, which are very easily roused, and her irritation at discovering that her new favorite is what Usk would call \"just like all the rest of them.\"  \"You perceive,\" he added, \"that, as the princess chooses wholly to ignore the past, it is not for me to recall it. I am obliged to accept her decision, however much I must suffer from it.\"  \"Suffer!\" echoes his cousin. \"After her husband's death you never took the trouble to cross Europe to see her.\"  \"She had never answered my letters,\" says Gervase, but he feels that the excuse is a frail one. And how, he thinks, angrily, should a good woman like his cousin, who has never flirted in her life and never done anything which might not have been printed in the daily papers, understand a man's inevitable inconstancy?  \"I assure you that I have never loved any woman as I loved her,\" he continues.  \"Then you are another proof, if one were wanted, that men have died and worms have eaten them, but not for----\"  \"I did not die, certainly,\" Gervase says, much irritated; \"but I suffered greatly, whether you choose to believe it or not.\"  \"I am not inclined to believe it,\" replies his hostess. \"It is not your style.\"  \"I wrote to her a great many times.\"  He pauses.  Lady Usk fills up the pause. \"And she answered you?\" she inquires.  \"N-no,\" replies Gervase, unwilling to confess such an affront to him. \"She did not write. Prudence, I suppose; or perhaps she might be too closely watched, or her letters might be stopped: who can say?\"  \"Nobody but herself, clearly. Well?\"  \"I was sent to Madrid; and I heard nothing of her except that Sabaroff was shot in a duel about her with Lustoff; but that was two years afterwards.\"  \"And when he was shot why did you not in due course go to the White Sea, or wherever she was, and offer yourself?\"  \"The truth is, I had become acquainted with a Spanish lady----\"  \"A great many Spanish ladies, no doubt! What a half-hearted Lothario!\"  \"Not at all. Only just at that time----\"  \"Manillas, mandolines, balconies, bull-fights, high mass, and moonlight had the supremacy! My dear Alan, tell your story how you will, you can't make yourself heroic.\"  \"I have not the smallest pretension to do so,\" says Gervase, very much annoyed. \"I have no heroism. I leave it to Lord Brandolin, who has been shipwrecked five hundred times, I believe, and ridden as many dromedaries over unknown sand-plains as Gordon----\"  \"As you don't care in the least for her, why should you care if his shipwrecks and his dromedaries interest her? We don't know that they do; but----\"  \"How little sympathy you have!\"  \"George says I have always a great deal too much. What do you want me to sympathize with? According to your own story, you 'loved and rode away;' at least, took a through-ticket across Europe, as Lovelace has to do in these prosaic days. If you did not go back to Russia when you might have gone back, _ qui la faute_? Nobody's but your own and the nameless Spanish lady or ladies'!\"  \"You are very perverse.\"  \"It is you who are, or who were, perverse. According to your own story, you adored a woman when she was unattainable; when she became attainable you did not even take the trouble to get into a railway-carriage: you were otherwise amused. What romantic element is there in such a tale as yours to excite the smallest fragment of interest? To judge you out of your own mouth, you seem to me to have behaved with most uninteresting inconstancy.\"  \"It was four years, and she had never answered my letters.\"  \"Really a reason to make you esteem her infinitely more than if she had answered them. My dear Alan, you were a flirt, and you forgot as flirts forget: why should one pity you for being so easily consoled? You ought to be infinitely grateful that Madame Sabaroff did not send you reams of reproaches, and telegraph you compromising messages which would have got you into trouble in Downing Street. The thing died a natural death; you did not care to keep it alive: why are you now all lamentations over its grave? I really do not follow the course of your emotions,--if you feel any emotion: I thought you never did. Madame Sabaroff has never been a person difficult to follow or to find; the fashionable intelligence of the newspapers would at any time have enabled you to know where she was; you never had inclination or remembrance enough to make you curious to see her again, and then when you come across her in a country house you think yourself very ill used because she does not all at once fall into your arms. You couldn't possibly care about her, since you never tried to see her all those years!\"  Dorothy Usk is really annoyed.  She is not a person who has a high standard of humanity at any time, and she knows men thoroughly, and they have no chance of being heroes in her sight. But she likes a man to be a man, and to be an ardent lover if he be a lover at all, and her favorite cousin seems to her to wear a poor aspect in this page of his autobiography.  \"Pray, did you know that she is as rich as she is?\" she asks, with some sharpness in her tone.  Gervase colors a little, being conscious that his response cannot increase his cousin's sympathies with him.  \"No. Is she rich? Paul Sabaroff was poor. He had gambled away nearly everything. Your children have a great deal of _blague_ about her riches; but I suppose it is all nonsense.\"  \"Not nonsense at all. Two years ago some silver was discovered on a bit of rough land which belonged to her, somewhere beyond the Urals, I think, and she is enormously rich,--will be richer every year, they say.\"  \"Indeed!\"  He tries to look indifferent, but his cousin's penetrating eyes seem to him to be reading his very soul.  \"How dreadfully sorry he must be that he didn't leave Madrid!\" she thinks, and aloud says, irritably, \"Why on earth didn't you try to renew things with her all these three years?\"  \"I imagined that I had forgotten her.\"  \"Well, so you had,--completely forgotten her, till you saw her here.\"  \"On my honor, she is the only woman I have ever really loved.\"  \"Oh, men always say that of somebody or another, generally of the most impossible people. George always declares that the only woman he ever really loved was a pastry-cook when he was at Christ-church.\"  \"Dear Dorothy, don't joke. I assure you I am thoroughly in earnest.\"  \"She certainly has forgotten you.\"  She knows that for him to be convinced of this is the surest way to revive a died-out passion.  \"Who knows? She would be indifferent in that case, and polite: as it is, she is cold, even rude.\"  \"That may be resentment.\"  \"Resentment means remembrance.\"  \"Oh, not always.\"  \"Then she has a number of my letters.\"  \"So you said; you cannot be so very sure she has kept them. Other people may have written her the same sort of letters, or more admirable letters still: how can you tell?\"  He colors angrily. \"She is not a _femme lgre_.\"  \"She is receiving a great deal of attention now from Lord Brandolin, and she does not seem to dislike it. They say he writes exquisite letters to women he is fond of; I don't know myself, because I have never had anything more interesting from him than notes about dinners or visits; but they say so. They even say that his deserted ladies forgive his desertions because he writes his farewells so divinely.\"  \"Lord Brandolin's epistolary accomplishments do not interest me in the least. Everybody knows what he is with women.\" He pauses a moment, then adds, with some hesitation,--  \"Dear Dorothy, you know her very well. Don't you think you could find out for me, and tell me----\"  \"What?\"  \"Well, what she thinks or does not think; in a word, how I stand with her.\"  \"No,--oh, no, my dear Alan; I couldn't attempt anything of that sort,--in my own house, too: it would seem so horribly rude. Besides, I am not in the least--not the very least--intimate with her. I think her charming, we are _bonnes connaiassances_, the children adore her; but I have never said anything intimate to her in my life,--never.\"  \"But you have so much tact.\"  \"The more tact I have, the less likely shall I be to recall to her what she is evidently perfectly determined to ignore. You can do it yourself if you want it done. You are not usually shy.\"  Gervase gets up impatiently, and walks about in the narrow limits of the boudoir, to the peril of the Svres and Saxe.  \"But women have a hundred indirect ways of finding out everything: you might discover perfectly well, if you chose, whether--whether she feels anger or any other sentiment; whether--whether, in a word, it would be prudent to recall the past to her.\"  Lady Usk shakes her head with energy, stirring all its pretty blonde curls, real and false. \"_Entre l'arbre et l'corce ne mettez pas le doigt._ That is sound advice which I have heard given at the Franais.\"  \"That is said of not interfering between married people.\"  \"It is generally true of people who wish, or may not wish, to marry. And I suppose, Alan, that when you speak in my house of renewing your--your--relations with the Princess Sabaroff, you do not mean that you have any object less serious than _le bon motif_?\"  Gervase is amused, although he is disconcerted and irritated.  \"Come, Dorothy, your guests are not always so very serious, are they? I never knew you so prim before.\"  Then she in turn feels angry. She always steadily adheres to the convenient fiction that she knows nothing whatever of the amorous filaments which bind her guests together in pairs, as turtle-doves might be tied together by blue ribbons.  \"If you only desire to reawake the sentiments of Madame Sabaroff in your favor that you may again make sport of them, you must excuse me if I say that I cannot assist your efforts, and that I sincerely hope they will not be successful,\" she says, with dignity and distance.  \"Do you suppose his are any better than mine?\" asks Gervase, irritably, as he waves his hand towards the window which looks on the west gardens. Between the yew- and cedar-trees, at some distance from the house, Brandolin is walking beside Xenia Sabaroff: his manner is interested and deferential; she moves with slow and graceful steps down the grassy paths, listening with apparent willingness, her head is uncovered, she carries a large sunshade opened over it made of white lace and pale-rose silk, she has a cluster of Duchess of Sutherland roses in her hand. They are really only speaking of recent French poets, but those who look at them cannot divine that.  \"He is not my cousin, and he does not solicit my assistance,\" says Dorothy Usk, seeing the figures in her garden with some displeasure. \"_Je ne fais pas la police pour les autres_; but if he asked me what you asked me, I should give him the same answer that I give to you.\"  \"He is probably independent of any assistance,\" says Gervase, with irritable irony.  \"Probably,\" says his hostess, who is very skilful at fanning faint flame. \"He is not a man whom I like myself, but many women--most women, I believe--think him irresistible.\"  Thereon she leaves him, without any more sympathy or solace, to go and receive some county people who have come to call, and who converse principally about prize poultry.  \"_Comme elles sont assommes avec leurs poules!_\" says the Marquise de Caillac, who chances to be present at this infliction, and gazes in stupefaction at a dowager duchess who has driven over from twenty miles off, who wears very thick boots, her own thin gray hair, water-proof tweed clothing, and a hat tied under her double chin with black strings. \"_Un paquet!_\" murmurs Madame de Caillac; \"_un vritable paquet!_\"  \"_C'est la vertu anglaise, un peu dmode_,\" says Lord Iona, with a yawn.  Gervase stays on as well as Brandolin, somewhat bored, very much _nerv_, but fascinated, too, by the presence of his Russian Ariadne, and stung by the sight of Brandolin's attentions to her into such a strong sense of revived passion that he means what he says when he declares to his cousin that the wife of Sabaroff was the only woman he has ever really loved. Her manner to him also, not cold enough to be complimentary, but entirely indifferent, never troubled, never moved in any way by his vicinity or by his direct allusions to the past, is such as irritates, piques, attracts, and magnetizes him. It seems to him incredible that any woman can ignore him so utterly. If she only seemed afraid of him, agitated in any way, even adversely, he could understand what was passing in her mind; but he cannot even flatter himself that she does this: she treats him with just such perfect indifference as she shows to the Duke of Queenstown or Hugo Mandeville or any one of the gilded youths there present. If he could once see a wistful memory in her glance, once see a flush of color on her face at his approach, it is probable that his vanity would be satisfied and his interest cease as quickly as it has revived; but he never does see anything of this sort, and, by the rule of contradiction, his desire to see it increases. And he wonders uneasily what she has done with his letters.     CHAPTER X.   Lord Gervase was eight years younger when he wrote those letters than he is now, and he has unpleasant recollections of unpleasant passages in them which would compromise him in his career, or at least get him horribly talked about, were they ever made sport of in the world. Where are his letters? Has Madame Sabaroff kept them? He longs to ask her, but he dare not.  He does not say to his cousin that he has more than once endeavored to hint to Xenia Sabaroff that it would be sweet to him to recall the past, would she permit it. But he has elicited no response. She has evaded without directly avoiding him. She is no longer the impressionable shy girl whom he knew in Russia, weighted with an unhappy fate, and rather alarmed by the very successes of her own beauty than flattered by them. She is a woman of the world, who knows her own value and her own power to charm, and has acquired the talent which the world teaches, of reading the minds of others without revealing her own. _Saule pleureur!_ the Petersburg court ladies had used to call her in those early times when the tears had started to her eyes so quickly; but no one ever sees tears in her eyes now.  Gervase is profoundly troubled to find how much genuine emotion the presence of a woman whose existence he had long forgotten has power to excite in him. He does not like emotion of any kind; and in all his affairs of the heart he is accustomed to make others suffer, not himself. Vanity and wounded vanity enter so largely into the influences moulding human life, that it is very possible, if the sight of him had had power to disturb her, the renewal of association with her would have left him unmoved. But, as it is, he has been piqued, mortified, excited, ad attracted; and the admiration which Brandolin and Lawrence Hamilton and other men plainly show of her is the sharpest spur to memory and to desire.  Whenever he has remembered Xenia Sabaroff, at such rare times as he has heard her name mentioned in the world, he has thought of her complacently as dwelling in the solitudes of Baltic forests, entirely devoted to his memory. Women who are entirely devoted to their memory men seldom trouble themselves to seek out; but to see her courted, sought, and desired, more handsome than ever, and apparently wholly indifferent to himself, is a shock to his self-esteem, and galvanism to his dead wishes and slumbering recollections. He begins to perceive that he would have done better not to forget her quite so quickly.  Meanwhile, all the guests at Surrenden, guided by a hint from Nina Curzon, begin to see a quantity of things which do not exist, and to exert their minds in endeavoring to remember a vast deal which they never heard with regard to both himself and her. No one knows anything or has a shadow of fact to go on, but this is an insignificant detail which does not tie their tongues in the least. Nina Curzon has invention enough to supply any _lacun_, and in this instance her imagination is stimulated by a double jealousy: she is jealous of Lawrence Hamilton, whom she is inclined to dismiss, and she is jealous of Brandolin, whom she is inclined to appropriate.  Twenty-four hours have not elapsed since the arrival of Gervase, before she has given a dozen people the intimate conviction that she knows all about him and the Princess Sabaroff, and that there is something very dreadful in it,--much worse than in the usual history of such relations. Everything is possible in Russia, she says, and has a way of saying this which suggests unfathomable abysses of license and crime.  No one has the slightest idea what she means, but no one will be behind any other in conjecturing; and there rises about the unconscious figure of Xenia Sabaroff a haze of vague suggested indistinct suspicion, like the smoke of the blue fires which hide the form of the Evil One on the stage in operas. Brandolin perceives it, and is deeply irritated.  \"What is it to me?\" he says to himself, but says so in vain.  Fragments of these ingenious conjectures and imaginary recollections come to his ear and annoy him intensely,--annoy him the more because his swift intuitions and unerring perceptions have told him from his own observation that Xenia Sabaroff does not see in Gervase altogether a stranger, though she has greeted him as such. Certain things are said which he would like to resent, but he is powerless to do so.  His days have been delightful to him before the arrival of this other man at Surrenden; now they are troubled and embittered. Yet he is not inclined to break off his visit abruptly and go to Scotland, Germany, or Norway, as might be wisest. He is in love with Xenia Sabaroff in a manner which surprises himself. He thought he had outlived that sort of boyish and imaginative passion. But she has a great power over his fancy and his senses, and she is more like his earliest ideal of a woman than any one he has ever met.  \"Absurd that I should have an ideal at all at my age!\" he thinks to himself; but, as there are some who are never accompanied by that ethereal attendant even in youth, so there are some whom it never leaves till they reach their graves.  Therefore when he hears these vague, floating, disagreeable jests, he suffers acutely, and finds himself in the position which is perhaps most painful of all to any man who is a gentleman, that of being compelled to sit silent and hear a woman he longs to protect lightly spoken of, because he has no right to defend her, and would indeed only compromise her more if he attempted her defence.  People do not venture to say much before Usk, because he is her host and might resent it, but nevertheless he too hears also something, and thinks to himself, \"Didn't I tell Dolly foreigners are never any better than they should be?\"  But Dulcia Waverley is here, and her languid and touching ways, her delicate health, and her soft sympathies have an indescribable sorcery for him at all times, so that he thinks but very little since her arrival of anything else. Usk likes women who believe devoutly that he might have been a great politician if he had chosen, and who also believe in his ruined digestion: no one affects both these beliefs so intensely as Lady Waverley, and when she tells him that he could have solved the Irish question in half an hour had he taken office, or that no one could understand his constitution except a German doctor in a bath in the Bhmerwald, whither she goes herself every autumn, she does, altogether and absolutely, anything she chooses with him.  His wife sees that quite well, and dislikes it, but it might be so much worse, she reflects: it might be a woman out of society, or a public singer, or an American adventuress: so she is reasonable, and always makes _bonne mine_ to Dulcia Waverley, with her nerves, her cures, and her angelic smiles. After all, it does not much matter, she thinks, if they like to go and drink nasty waters together and poison themselves with sulphur, iron, and potassium. It is one of the odd nineteenth-century ways of playing Antony and Cleopatra.  Notwithstanding the absorption of his thoughts, Usk, however, one day spares a moment from Lady Waverley and his own liver, to put together words dropped by different people then under his own roof, to ponder upon them, and finally to interrogate his wife.  \"Did you know that people say they used to carry on together?\" he asks, without preamble.  \"Who?\" asks the lady of Surrenden, sharply.  \"Madame Sabaroff and Gervase,\" he growls. \"It'd be odd if they hadn't, as they've come to this house!\"  \"Of course I knew they were friends; but there was never anything between them in the vulgar sense which you would imply renders them eligible for my house,\" replies Dorothy Usk, with the severity of a woman whose conscience is clear, and the tranquillity of a woman who is telling a falsehood.  Usk stares at her. \"Well, if you knew it, you rode a dark horse, then, when you asked her here?\"  \"Your expressions are incoherent,\" returns his wife. \"If I wished two people to meet when both were free, who had had a certain sympathy for each other when honor kept them apart, there is nothing very culpable in it? What is your objection?\"  \"Oh, Lord, I've no objection: I don't care a straw,\" says her lord, with a very moody expression. \"But Brandolin will, I suspect: she's certainly encouraged him. I think you might have shown us your cards.\"  \"Lord Brandolin is certainly old enough to take care of himself in affairs of the heart, and experienced enough, too, if one is to believe all one hears,\" replies his wife. \"What can he care, either, for a person he has known a few days? Whereas the attachment of Gervase to her is of very long date and most romantic origin. He has loved her hopelessly for eight years.\"  Usk gives a grim guffaw. \"The constancy has had many interludes, I suspect! Now I see why you took such a craze for the lady; but you might have said what you were after to me, at any rate. I could have hinted to Brandolin how the land lay, and he wouldn't have walked with his eyes shut into her net.\"  \"Her 'net'? She is as cold as ice to him!\" replies his wife, with disgust; \"and, were she otherwise, the loves of your friend are soon consoled. He writes a letter, takes a voyage, and throws his memories overboard. Alan's temperament is far more serious.\"  \"If by serious you mean selfish, I agree with you. There isn't such another d----d egotist anywhere under the sun.\" And, much out of temper, Usk flings himself out of the room and goes to Lady Waverley, who is lying on a sofa in the small library. She has a headache, but her smile is sweet, her hand cool, her atmosphere soothing and delightful, with the blinds down and an odor of attar of roses.  If any one were to tell Dolly Usk that she had been making up fibs on this occasion, she would be mortally offended and surprised. She would reply that she had only been _brodant un peu_,--putting the thing as it ought to be put, as it must be put, if Gervase is to obtain the hand of Xenia Sabaroff, and if nobody is to know anything which ought not to be known. Indeed, she has pondered so much on this manner of putting it, that she has almost ended in believing that her version of the story is the true one.  \"Brandolin's feelings, indeed!\" she thinks, with great contempt. \"As if any pain he might feel, if he did feel any, would not be due and fitting retribution upon him for the horrid life he has led, and the way he has played fast and loose with women. He can go back to his Hindoos, whose figures are so superior to any European's! But George is always so absurd about his friends.\"  Whereon, being in an irritated and unkind mood, she desires the servant, who just then announces the visit of the rector of the parish, to show that reverend person into the small library, where she knows that Dulcia Waverley is trying to get rid of her headache. It is very seldom that she is unwise enough to indulge in this kind of domestic vengeance; but at this moment it seems sweet to her.  The unfortunate and innocent rector finds the lord of Surrenden monosyllabic and impolite, but Lady Waverley, woman-like, is wholly equal to the occasion, and in her sweet low voice discourses of village choirs, and village readings, and village medicines and morals, with such divine patience and feminine adaptability that the good man dismisses from his mind as impossible what he had certainly fancied he saw in the moment when the library door opened before him.  If ever there was purity incarnate, Dulcia Waverley looks it, with her white gown, her Madonna-like hair, her dewy pensive eyes, and her appealing smile. She suggests the portraits in the Keepsakes and Forget-me-Nots of fifty years ago; she has always about her the faint old-fashioned perfume of attar of roses, and she wears her soft fair hair in Raphaelite bands which in any other woman would look absurd; but her experience has told her that, despite all change in modes and manners, the surest weapons to subdue strong men are still those old-fashioned charms of fragility and of apparent helplessness which made Othello weep when his bridal moon was young above the Venetian waters. Only if she had ever spoken candidly all she knows, which she never by any chance does, she would say that to succeed thus with Othello, or with any other male creature, you must be, under all your apparent weakness, tenacious as a magnet and cold as steel. Therein lies the secret of all power: the velvet glove and the iron hand may be an old saying, but it is a truth never old.  The conclusion which she had drawn from Gervase and his fragmentary story has seriously annoyed and shocked his cousin, but on reflection she decides to adhere to her invariable rule of ignoring all that is equivocal in it, and treating it accordingly.  No one has ever heard Lady Usk admit that there is the slightest impropriety in the relations of any of her guests: it is one of those fictions like the convenient fictions of the law, which are so useful that every one agrees not to dispute their acceptance. She will never know a person who is really compromised. Therefore, if there be any soil on the wings of her doves, she shuts her eyes to it so long as those of the world are shut. She has the agreeable power of never seeing but what she wishes to see: so, although for the moment she has been uncomfortably shocked, she recovers her composure rapidly, and persuades herself that Gervase merely spoke of a passing attachment, perfectly pure. Why should he not marry the object of it? To the mind of Dorothy Usk that would make everything right. Things may have been wrong once, but that is nobody's business. Xenia Sabaroff is a charming and beautiful woman, and the silver-mine beyond the Urals is a very real thing. Lady Usk is not a mercenary, she is even a generous woman; but when English fortunes are so embarrassed as they are in this day, with Socialists at the roots and a Jacquerie tearing at the fruits of them, any solid fortune situated out of England would be of great use to any Englishman occupying a great position.  \"We shall all of us have to live abroad before long,\" she reflects, with visions of Hodge chopping down her palms for firewood and Sally smashing the porcelain in her model dairy.  No doubt the relations of her cousin and her guest have not been always what they ought to have been; but she does not wish to think of this, and she will not think of it: by-gones are always best buried. The people who manage to be happy are those who understand the art of burying them and use plenty of quicklime.  During the twenty years which have elapsed since her presentation, Dolly Usk has had a very varied experience of men and women, and has continually been solicited to interfere in their love-affairs, or has even interfered without being solicited. She likes the feeling of being a _diva ex machina_ to her friends, and, though she has so decidedly refused Gervase her assistance to discover the state of Xenia Sabaroff's feelings towards him, she begins in her own mind immediately to cast about for some indirect means of learning it, and arranges in her own fancy the whole story as it will sound prettiest and most proper, if she be ever called on to relate it to the world.  She has a talent at putting such stories so nicely in order that anything which may be objectionable in them is altogether invisible, as a clever _faiseur_ will so arrange old laces on a court train that the darns and stains in them are wholly hidden away. She likes exercising her ingenuity in this way; and, although the narrative given her by Gervase has certainly seemed to her objectionable, and one which places the hero of it in an unpleasant light, it may with tact be turned so as to show nothing but what is interesting. And to this end she also begins to drop little hints, little phrases suggestive of that virtue of blameless and long constancy with which it is necessary to invest her cousin Alan, if he is to be made a centre of romance. She even essays these very delicately on the ear of Xenia Sabaroff; but they are met with so absolute a lack of response, so discouraging and cold an absence of all understanding, that she cannot continue to try them in that direction.  \"If that odious Brandolin were not here!\" she thinks, irritably.  The attentions of Brandolin are very marked to the Princess Sabaroff, and are characterized by that carelessness of comment and that color of romance which have always marked his interest in any woman. He is not a rival _ plaisanter_, she knows; but then she knows, too, that he never is serious in these matters. When she first hears the story of Gervase, she heartily wishes that there were any pretence to get rid of Xenia Sabaroff, and hastily wonders what excuse she could make to break up her Surrenden circle. But on reflection she desires as strongly to retain her there; and, as there is to be a child's costume ball on the occasion of the Babe's birthday a fortnight hence, she makes the children entreat their friend to stay for it, and adds her own solicitation to theirs. Madame Sabaroff hesitates, is inclined to refuse, but at length acquiesces.  Unfortunately, Usk, who always to his wife's mind represents the bull in the china-shop with regard to any of her delicate and intricate combinations, insists that Brandolin shall not leave either. So the situation remains unchanged, though many guests come and go, some staying two days, some three or four.  Xenia Sabaroff has seen and suffered enough to make her not lightly won or easily impressed. She knows enough of the world to know her own value in it, and she has measured the brutality and the inconsistency which may lie under the most polished exterior.  \"I am not old yet in years,\" she says, once, \"but I am very old in some things. I have no illusions.\"  \"When there is a frost in spring the field-flowers die,\" says Brandolin, softly, \"but they come again.\"  \"In the fields, perhaps,\" replies Xenia Sabaroff.  \"And in the human heart,\" says Brandolin.  He longs to ask her what have been the relations between her and Gervase which people seem so sure have existed once; he longs to know whether it was the brutality of her husband, or the infidelity of any lover, which has taught her so early the instability of human happiness.  But he hesitates before any demand, however veiled or delicate, upon her confidence. He has known her such a little while, and he is conscious that she is not a _femme facile_. It is her greatest fascination for him: though he is credited with holding women lightly, he is a man whose theories of what they ought to be are high and difficult to realize. Each day that he sees her at Surrenden tends to convince him more and more that she does realize them, despite the calumnies which are set floating round her name.  One day, among several new arrivals, a countryman of hers comes down from London, where, being momentarily _charg-d'affaires_ of the Russian Legation, he has been cursing the heat, the dust, the deserted squares, the empty clubs, the ugly parks, and rushing out of town whenever he can for twenty-four hours, as he now comes to Surrenden from Saturday to Monday. \"_Comme un calicot! Comme un calicot!_\" he says, piteously. Such are the miseries of the diplomatic service.  He kisses the hand of Madame Sabaroff with ardor and reverence: he has known her in her own country. A gleam of amusement comes into his half-shut gray eyes as he recognizes Gervase.  The next morning is Sunday. Usk and Dulcia Waverley are at church, with the children and Lady Usk and Nina Curzon.  Brandolin strays into the small library, takes down a book, and stretches himself on a couch. He half expects that Madame Sabaroff will come down before luncheon and also seek a book, as she did last Sunday. He lights a cigarette and waits, lazily watching the peacocks drawing their trains over the velvety turf without. It is a lovely dewy morning, very fresh and fragrant after rains in the night. He thinks he will persuade her to go for a walk: there is a charming walk near, under deep trees by a little brown brook, full of forget-me-nots.  He hears a step, and looks up: he does not see her, but the Russian secretary, Gregor Litroff, always called \"Toffy\" by his female friends in England.  \"_Dieu de Dieu!_ What an institution your English Sunday is!\" says Litroff, with a yawn. \"I looked out of my window an hour ago, and beheld Usk in a tall hat, with his little boy on one side and miladi Waverley on the other, solemnly going to church. How droll! He would not do it in London.\"  \"It is not more ridiculous to go to church in a tall hat than to prostrate yourself and kiss a wooden cross, as you would do if you were at home,\" says Brandolin, contemptuously, eying the intruder with irritation.  \"That may be,\" says the secretary, good-humoredly. \"We do it from habit, to set an example, not to make a fuss. So, I suppose, does he.\"  \"Precisely,\" says Brandolin, wondering how he shall get rid of this man.  \"And he takes Lady Waverley for an example, too?\" asks Litroff, with a laugh.  \"Religion enjoins us,\" replies Brandolin, curtly, \"to offer what we have most precious to the Lord.\"  The secretary laughs again.  \"That is very good,\" he says, with enjoyment.  Mr. Wootton comes in at that instant. He has been away, but has returned: the cooks at Surrenden are admirable. Brandolin sees his hopes of a _tte--tte_ and a walk in the home wood fading farther and farther from view. Mr. Wootton has several telegram-papers in his hand.  \"All bad news, from all the departments,\" he remarks.  \"There is nothing but bad news,\" says Brandolin. \"It is painful to die by driblets. We shall all be glad when we have got the thing over,--seen Windsor burnt, London sacked, Ireland admitted to the American Union, and Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone crowned at Westminster.\"  Mr. Wootton coughs: he does not like unseemly jests, nor to have the gravity and exclusiveness of the private intelligence he receives doubted. He turns to Litroff, talks of Russian politics, and brings the conversation round to the Princess Sabaroff.  Brandolin, appearing absorbed in his book, lies on his couch wondering whether he should meet her anywhere about the gardens if he went out. He listens angrily when he hears her name.  \"Was she ever talked about?\" asks Mr. Wootton, searching the book-shelves.  \"What charming woman is not?\" returns Litroff, gallantly.  \"My dear count,\" replies Mr. Wootton, with grave rebuke, \"we have thousands of noble wives and mothers in England before whom Satan himself would be obliged to bow in reverence.\"  \"Ah, truly,\" says Litroff: \"so have we, I dare say: I have never asked.\"  \"No doubt you have,\" says Mr. Wootton, kindly. \"The virtue of its women is the great safeguard of a nation.\"  \"One understands why England is losing her nice equipoise, then, now,\" murmurs Brandolin.  Mr. Wootton disregards him.  \"But Madame Sabaroff _was_ talked about, I think,--unjustly, no doubt?\" he insists.  Mr. Wootton always insists.  \"Ach!\" says Litroff, apologetically, \"Sabaroff was such a great brute. It was very natural----\"  \"What was natural?\"  \"That she should console herself.\"  \"Ah! she did console herself?\"  Litroff smiles. \"Ask Lord Gervase: he was Lord Baird at that time. We all expected he would have married her when Sabaroff was shot.\"  \"But it was Lustoff who shot Sabaroff in a duel about her?\"  \"Not about her. Lustoff quarrelled with him about a gambling affair, not about her at all, though people have said so. Lord Baird--Gervase--was, I am certain, her first lover, and has been her only one, as yet.\"  Brandolin flings his book with some violence on the floor, gets up, and walks to the window. Mr. Wootton looks after him.  \"No one could blame her,\" says Litroff, who is a good-natured man. \"She was married when she was scarcely sixteen to a brute; she was immensely admired; she was alone in the midst of a society both loose and brilliant; Gervase laid siege to her sans trve, and she was hardly more than a child.\"  \"Where there is no principle early implanted,\" begins Mr. Wootton----  But Litroff is not patient under preaching. \"My dear sir,\" he says, impatiently, \"principle (of that kind) is more easily implanted in plain women than in handsomer ones. Madame Sabaroff is a proud woman, which comes to nearly the same thing as a high-principled one. She has lived like a saint since Sabaroff was shot, and if she take up matters with her early lover again it will only be, I imagine, this time, _pour le bon motif_. Anyhow, I don't see why we should blame her for the past, when the present shows us such an admirable and edifying spectacle as miladi Waverley and miladi Usk going to sit in church with George Usk between them!\"  Whereon the Russian secretary takes a \"Figaro\" off the newspaper-table, and rudely opens it and flourishes it between Mr. Wootton and himself, in sign that the conversation is ended.  Mr. Wootton has never been so treated in his life.     CHAPTER XI.   Brandolin walks down the opening between the glass doors into the garden. He paces impatiently the green shady walks where he has seen her on other mornings than this. It is lovely weather, and the innumerable roses fill the warm moist air with fragrance. There is a sea-breeze blowing from the sea-coast some thirty miles away; his schooner is in harbor there; he thinks that it would be wisest to go to it and sail away again for as many thousand miles as he has just left behind him. Xenia Sabaroff has a great and growing influence over him, and he does not wish her to exercise it and increase it if this thing be true: perhaps, after all, she may be that kind of sorceress of which Mary Stuart is the eternal type,--cold only that others may burn, _reculant pour mieux sauter_, exquisitely feminine only to be more dangerously powerful. He does not wish to play the _rle_ of Chastelard, or of Douglas, or of Henry Darnley. He is stung to the quick by what he has heard said.  It is not new: since the arrival of Gervase the same thing has been hinted more or less clearly, more or less obscurely, within his hearing more than once; but the matter-of-fact words of Litroff have given the tale a kind of circumstantiality and substance which the vague uncertain suggestions of others did not do. Litroff has, obviously, no feeling against her; he even speaks of her with reluctance and admiration: therefore his testimony has a truthfulness about it which would be lacking in any mere malicious scandal.  It is intensely painful to him to believe, or even to admit to himself as possible, that it may be thus true. She seems to him a very queen among women: all the romance of his temperament clothes her with ideal qualities. He walks on unconsciously till he has left the west garden and entered the wood which joins it, and the grassy seats made underneath the boughs. As he goes, his heart thrills, his pulse quickens: he sees Madame Sabaroff. She is seated on one of the turf banks, reading, the dog of the house at her feet. He has almost walked on to her before he has perceived her.  \"I beg your pardon,\" he murmurs, and pauses, undecided whether to go or stay.  She looks at him a little surprised at the ceremony of his manner.  \"For what do you beg my pardon? You are as free of the wood as I,\" she replies, with a smile. \"I promised the children to keep their dogs quiet, and to await them here as they return from their church.\"  \"You are too good to the children,\" says Brandolin, still with restraint. Her eyes open with increased surprise. She has never seen his manner, usually so easy, nonchalant, and unstudied, altered before.  \"He must have heard bad news,\" she thinks, but says nothing, and keeps her book open.  Brandolin stands near, silent and absorbed. He is musing what worlds he would give, if he had them, to know whether the story is true! He longs passionately to ask her in plain words, but it would be too brutal and too rude; he has not known her long enough to be able to presume to do so.  He watches the sunshine fall through the larch boughs on to her hands in their long loose gloves and touch the pearls which she always wears at her throat.  \"How very much he is unlike himself!\" she thinks; she misses his spontaneous and picturesque eloquence, his warm _abandon_ of manner, his caressing deference of tone. At that moment there is a gleam of white between the trees, a sound of voices in the distance.  The family party are returning from church. The dogs jump up and wag their tails and bark their welcome. The Babe is dashing on in advance. There is an end of their brief _tte--tte_; he passionately regrets the loss of it, though he is not sure of what he would have said in it.  \"Always together!\" says Dulcia Waverley, in a whisper, to Usk, as she sees them. \"Does he know that he succeeds Lord Gervase, do you think?\"  \"How should I know?\" says Usk; \"and Dolly says there was nothing between her and Gervase,--nothing; at least it was all in honor, as the French say.\"  \"Oh, of course,\" agrees Lady Waverley, with her plaintive eyes gazing dreamily down the aisle of larch-trees. The children have run on to Madame Sabaroff.  \"Where is Alan?\" thinks Dolly Usk, angrily, on seeing Brandolin.  Gervase, who is not an early riser, is then taking his coffee in bed as twelve strikes. He detests an English Sunday: although at Surrenden it is disguised as much as possible to look like any other day, still there is a Sunday feeling in the air, and Usk does not like people to play cards on Sundays: it is his way of being virtuous vicariously.  \"Primitive Christianity,\" says Brandolin, touching the white feathers of Dodo's hat and the white lace on her short skirts.  \"We only go to sleep,\" replies the child, disconsolately. \"We might just as well go to sleep at home; and it is so hot in that pew, with all that red cloth!\"  \"My love!\" says Dulcia Waverley, scandalized.  \"Lady Waverley don't go to sleep!\" cries the Babe, in his terribly clear little voice. \"She was writing in her hymn-book and showing it to papa.\"  No one appears to hear this indiscreet remark except Dodo, who laughs somewhat rudely.  \"I was trying to remember the hymn of Faber's 'Longing for God,'\" says Lady Waverley, who is never known to be at a loss. \"The last verse escapes me. Can any one recall it? It is so lamentable that sectarianism prevents those hymns from being used in Protestant churches.\"  But no one there present is religious enough or poetic enough to help her to the missing lines.  \"There is so little religious feeling anywhere in England,\" she remarks, with a sigh.  \"It's the confounded levelling that destroys it,\" says Usk, echoing the sigh.  \"They speak of Faber,\" says Madame Sabaroff. \"The most beautiful and touching of all his verses are those which express the universal sorrow of the world.\"  And in her low, grave, melodious voice she repeats a few of the lines of the poem:      \"The sea, unmated creature, tired and lone,     Makes on its desolate sands eternal moan.     Lakes on the calmest days are ever throbbing     Upon their pebbly shores with petulant sobbing.      \"The beasts of burden linger on their way     Like slaves, who will not speak when they obey;     Their eyes, whene'er their looks to us they raise,     With something of reproachful patience gaze.      \"Labor itself is but a sorrowful song,     The protest of the weak against the strong;     Over rough waters, and in obstinate fields,     And from dark mines, the same sad sound it yields.\"  She is addressing Brandolin as she recites them; they are a little behind the others.  He does not reply, but looks at her with an expression in his eyes which astonishes and troubles her. He is thinking, as the music of her tones stirs his innermost soul, that he can believe no evil of her, will believe none,--no, though the very angels of heaven were to cry out against her.     CHAPTER XII.   \"Where were you all this morning?\" asks Lady Usk of her cousin, after luncheon.  \"I never get up early,\" returns Gervase. \"You know that.\"  \"Brandolin was in the home wood with Madame Sabaroff as we returned from church,\" remarks Dolly Usk. \"They were together under a larch-tree. They looked as if they were on the brink of a quarrel or at the end of one: either may be an interesting _rapprochement_.\"  \"I dare say they were only discussing some poet. They are always discussing some poet.\"  \"Then they had fallen out over the poet. Poets are dangerous themes. Or perhaps she had been showing him your letters, if, as you seem to think, she carries them about with her everywhere like a reliquary.\"  \"I never presumed to imagine that she had preserved them for a day.\"  \"Oh, yes, you did. You had a vision of her weeping over them in secret every night, until you saw her here and found her as unlike a _dlaiss_ as a woman can be.\"  \"Certainly she does not look that. Possibly, if Dido could have been dressed by Worth and Rodrigues, had diamonds as big as plovers' eggs, and been adored by Lord Brandolin, she would never have perished in despair. _Autres temps autres m[oe]urs._\"  He speaks with sullen and scornful bitterness: his handsome face is momentarily flushed.  Dorothy Usk looks at him with inquisitiveness: she has never known him fail to rely on his own attractions before. \"You are unusually modest,\" she replies. \"Certainly, in our days, if neas does not come back, we take somebody else; sometimes we do that even if he does come back.\"  Gervase is moodily silent.  \"I never knew you 'funk a fence' before!\" says his cousin to him, sarcastically.  \"I have tried to say something to her,\" replies Gervase, moodily, \"but she gives me no hearing, no occasion.\"  \"I should have thought you were used well enough to make both for yourself,\" returns his cousin, with curt sympathy. \"You have always been 'master of yourself, though women sigh,'--a paraphrase of Pope at your service.\"  Gervase smiled, conscious of his past successes and willing to acknowledge them.  \"But you see she does not sigh!\" he murmurs, with a sense that the admission is not flattering to his own _amour-propre_.  \"You have lost the power to make her sigh, do you mean?\"  \"I make no impression on her at all. I am utterly unable to imagine her feelings, her sentiments,--how much she would acknowledge, how much she would ignore.\"  \"That is a confession of great helplessness! I should never have believed that you would be baffled by any woman, above all by a woman who once loved you.\"  \"It is not easy to make a fire out of ashes.\"  \"Not if the ashes are quite cold, certainly; but if a spark remains in them, the fire soon comes again.\"  He is silent: the apparent indifference of a person whom he believed to be living out her life in solitude, occupied only with his memory, annoys and mortifies him. He has never doubted his own power to write his name indelibly on the hearts of women.  \"Perhaps she wishes to marry Brandolin?\" suggests Dorothy Usk.  \"Pshaw!\" says Lord Gervase.  \"Why pshaw?\" repeats his cousin, persistently. \"He would not be a man to my taste, and he hates marriage, and he has a set of Hindoos at St. Hubert's Lea, which would require as much cleaning as the Augean stable; but I dare say she doesn't know anything about them, and he may be persuading her that he thinks marriage opens the doors of Paradise: men can so easily pretend that sort of thing! A great many men have wanted to marry her, I believe, since she came back into the world after her seclusion. George declares that Brandolin is quite serious.\"  \"Preposterous!\" replies Lord Gervase.  \"Really, I don't see that,\" replies his judicious cousin. \"A great many women have wanted to marry _him_, though one wonders why. Indeed, I have heard some of them declare that he is wholly irresistible when he chooses.\"  \"With Hindoos, perhaps,\" says Gervase.  \"With our own women,\" says his cousin. \"Lady Mary Jardine died of a broken heart because he wouldn't look at her.\"  \"Pray spare me the roll-call of his victims,\" says Lord Gervase, irritably: he is passionately jealous of Brandolin. He himself had forgotten Xenia Sabaroff, and forgotten all his obligations to her, when she had been, as he always had believed, within reach of his hand if he stretched it out; but viewed as a woman whom other men wooed and another man might win, she has become to him intensely to be desired and to be disputed. He has been a spoiled child of fortune and of the drawing-rooms all his years, and the slightest opposition is intolerable to him.  \"I have no doubt,\" continues Dorothy Usk, gently, continuing her embroidery of a South Kensington design of lilies and palm-leaves, \"that if he were aware you had a prior claim, if he thought or knew that you had ever enjoyed her sympathy, he would immediately withdraw and leave the field: he is a very proud man, with all his carelessness, and would not, I think, care to be second to anybody in the affections of a woman whom he seriously sought.\"  \"What do you mean?\" asks Gervase, abruptly, pausing in his walk to and fro the boudoir.  \"Only what I say,\" she answers. \"If you wish to _loigner_ Brandolin, give him some idea of the truth.\"  Gervase laughs a little.  \"On my honor,\" he thinks, with some bitterness, \"for sheer uncompromising meanness there is nothing comparable to the suggestions which a woman will make to you!\"  \"I couldn't do that,\" he says, aloud. \"What would he think of me?\"  \"My dear Alan,\" replies Dorothy Usk, impatiently, getting her silks in a tangle, \"when a man has behaved to any woman as you, by your own account, have behaved to Madame Sabaroff, I think it is a little late in the day to pretend to much elevation of feeling.\"  \"You do not understand----\"  \"I have always found,\" says his cousin, impatiently searching for shades of silk which she does not see, \"that whenever we presume to pronounce an opinion on any man's conduct and think ill of it we are always told that we don't understand anything. When we flatter the man, or compliment him on his conduct, there is no end to the marvellous powers of our penetration, the fineness of our instincts, the accuracy of our intuitions.\"  Gervase does not hear: his thoughts are elsewhere: he is thinking of Xenia Sabaroff as he saw her first in the Salle des Palmiers in the Winter Palace,--a mere girl, a mere child, startled and made nervous by the admiration she excited and the homage she received, under the brutality of her husband, the raillery of her friends; but that time is long ago, very long, as the life of women counts, and Xenia Sabaroff is now perfect mistress of her own emotions, if emotions she ever feels. Gervase cannot for one moment tell whether the past is tenderly remembered by her, is utterly forgotten, or is only recalled to be touched and dismissed without regret. He is a vain man, but vanity has no power to reassure him here.  In the warm afternoon of the next day the children are in the school-room, supposed to be preparing their lessons for the morrow; but the German governess, who is alone as guardian of order in the temple of intellect, has fallen asleep, with flies buzzing about her blonde hair, and her blue spectacles pushed up on her forehead, and Dodo has taken advantage of the fact to go and lean out of one of the windows, whilst her sister draws a caricature of the sleeping virgin from Deutschland, and the Babe slips away from his books to a mechanical Punch, which, contraband in the school-room, is far dearer to him than his Gradus and rule of three.  Dodo, with her hands thrust among her abundant locks, lolls with half her body in the air, and, by twisting her neck almost to dislocation, manages to see round an ivy-grown buttress of the east wall, and to espy people who are getting on their horses at the south doors of the building.  \"They are going out riding and I am shut up here!\" she groans. \"Oh, what a while it takes one to grow up!\"  \"Who are going to ride?\" asks Lilie, too fascinated by her drawing to leave it.  \"Lots of them,\" replies Dodo, who speaks four languages, and her own worst of all. \"All of them, pretty nearly. Mamma's on Pepper, and Lady Waverley's got Bopeep,--she's always nervous, you know. I can't see very much, 'cause of the ivy. Oh, there's the princess on Satan,--nobody else could ride Satan; Lord Brandolin's put her up, and now he's riding by her. They're gone now,--and papa's stopping behind them all to do something to Bopeep's girths.\" Whereat the dutiful Dodo laughs rudely, as she laughed coming home from church.  The sound of the horses' hoofs going farther away down the avenue comes through the stillness, as her voice and her laughter cease.  \"What a shame to be shut up here just because one isn't old!\" she groans, as she listens enviously. The sun is pouring liquid gold through the ivy-leaves, the air is hot and fragrant, gardeners are watering the flower-beds below, and the sweet, moist scent comes up to Dodo's nostrils and makes her writhe with longing to get out; not that she is by any means ardently devoted to nature, but she loves life, movement, gayety, and she dearly loves showing off her figure on her pony and being flirted with by her father's friends.  \"I am sure Lord Brandolin is in love with her, awfully in love,\" she says, as she peers into the distance, where the black form of Satan is just visible through far-off oak-boughs.  \"With whom?\" asks Lilie, getting up from her caricature to lean also out over the ivy.  \"Xenia,\" says Dodo. She is very proud of calling her friend Xenia. \"Take care Goggles don't wake, or she'll see what you've been doing.\"  The lady from Deutschland was always known to them by this endearing epithet.  \"I don't care,\" says Lilie, kicking her bronze boots in the air. \"Do you think she'll marry Lord Brandolin?\"  \"Who? Goggles?\"  \"The idea!\" They laugh deliciously.  \"You say he's in love with Xenia. If they're in love they will marry,\" says Lilie, pensively.  \"No, they won't: people who are in love never marry,\" replies Dodo.  \"What do they do, then?\" inquires the younger sister.  \"They marry somebody else, and ask the one they like to go and stay with them. It is much better,\" she adds. \"It is what I shall do.\"  \"Why is it better? It's a roundabout way,\" objects Lilie. \"I shouldn't care to marry at all,\" she adds, \"only one can't ever be Mistress of the Robes if one doesn't.\"  \"Oh, everybody marries, of course; only some muff it, and don't get all they want by it,\" replies the cynic Dodo.  \"_Et l'amour, Miladi Alexandra?_\" says the French governess, entering at that moment. \"_O donc mettez-vous l'amour?_\"  \"_Nous ne sommes pas des bourgeoises_,\" returns Dodo, very haughtily.  The Babe, sitting astride on a chair, trying to mend his mechanical Punch, who screamed and beat his wife _absolument comme la nature_, as the French governess said, before he was broken, hears the discourse of his sisters and muses on it. He is very fond of Brandolin, and he adores his princess: he would like them to live together, and he would go and see them without his sisters, who tease him, and without Boom, who lords it over him. Into his busy and precocious little brain there enters the resolution to _pousser la machine_, as his governess would call it.  The Babe has a vast idea of his own resources in the way of speech and invention, and he has his mother's tendencies to interfere with other people's affairs, and is quite of an opinion that if he had the management of most things he should better them. He has broken his Parisian Punch in his endeavor to make it say more words than it could say, but this slight accident does not affect his own admiration and belief in his own powers, any more than to have brought a great and prosperous empire within measurable distance of civil war affects a statesman's conviction that he is the only person who can rule that empire. The Babe, like Mr. Gladstone, is in his own eyes infallible. Like the astute diplomatist he is, he waits for a good opportunity; he is always where the ladies are, and his sharp little wits have been preternaturally quickened in that atmosphere of what the French call \"_l'odeur fminine_.\"  He has to wait some days for his occasion. The frank and friendly intercourse which existed at first between Brandolin and Madame Sabaroff is altered: they are never alone, and the pleasant discussions on poets and poetry, on philosophers and follies, in the gardens in the forenoon are discontinued, neither could very well say why, but the presence of Gervase chills and oppresses both of them and keeps them apart. She has the burden of memory, he the burden of suspicion; and suspicion is a thing so hateful and intolerable to the nature of Brandolin that it makes him miserable to feel himself guilty of it.  But one morning the Babe coaxes her out to go with him to his garden,--a floral republic, where a cabbage comes up cheek by jowl with a gloxinia, and plants are plucked up by the roots to see if they are growing aright. The Babe's system of horticulture is to dig intently for ten minutes in all directions, to make himself very red in the face, and then to call Dick, Tom, or Harry, any under-gardener who may be near, and say, \"Here, do it, will you?\" Nevertheless, he retains the belief that he is the creator and cultivator of this his garden, as M. Grvy believes that he is the chief person in the French Republic; and he takes Madame Sabaroff to admire it.  \"It would look better if it were a little more in order,\" she permits herself to observe.  \"Oh, that's their fault,\" says the Babe, just as M. Grvy would say of disorder in the Chambers, the Babe meaning Dick, Tom, or Harry, as the President would mean Clmenceau, Rochefort, or M. de Mun.  \"My dear Babe, how exactly you are like the Head of a Department!\" says Brandolin, who has followed them out of the house and comes up behind them. \"According to the Head of a Department, it is never the head that is at fault, always the understrappers. May I inquire since when it has become the fashion to set sunflowers with their heads downward?\"  \"I wanted to see if the roots would turn after the sun,\" says the Babe, and regards his explanation as triumphant.  \"And they only die! How perverse of them! You would become a second Newton, if your destiny were not already cast, to dazzle the world by a blending of Beau Brummel and Sir Joseph Paxton.\"  The Babe looks a little cross; he does not like to be laughed at before his princess. He has got his opportunity, but it vexes him; he has an impression that his companions will soon drift into forgetting both him and his garden. Since the approach of Brandolin the latter has said nothing.  The children's gardens are in a rather wild and distant part of the grounds of Surrenden. It is noon; most people staying in the house are still in their own rooms; it is solitary, sunny, still; a thrush is singing in a jessamine thicket, there is no other sound except that of a gardener's broom sweeping on the other side of the laurel hedge.  The Babe feels that it is now or never for his _coup de matre_.  He plucks a rose, the best one he has, and offers it to Madame Sabaroff, who accepts it gratefully, though it is considerably earwig-eaten, and puts it in her corsage.  The eyes of Brandolin follow it wistfully.  The Babe glances at them alternately from under his hair, then his small features assume an expression of cherubic innocence and unconsciousness. The most _rus_ little rogue in the whole kingdom, he knows how to make himself look like a perfect reproduction of Sir Joshua Reynolds's Artlessness or Infancy. He gazes up in Xenia Sabaroff's face with angelic simplicity admirably assumed.  \"When you marry him,\" says the Babe, pointing to Brandolin, with admirably affected _navet_, \"you will let me hold up your train, won't you? I always hold up my friends' trains when they marry. I have a page's dress, Louis something or other, and a sword, and a velvet cap with a badge and a feather: I always look very well.\"  \"Oh, what an odious _petit-matre_ you will be when you are a man, my dear Babe!\" says Xenia Sabaroff.  She does not take any notice of his opening words, but a flush of color comes over her face and passes as quickly as it came.  \"_Petit-matre_,--what is that?\" says the Babe. \"But you will let me, won't you? And don't marry him till the autumn, or even the winter, because the velvet makes me so hot when the day is hot, and the dress wouldn't look nice made in thin things.\"  \"Could I only add my prayer to his,\" murmurs Brandolin, \"and hope that in the autumn----\"  Xenia Sabaroff looks at him with a strange gaze: it is penetrating, dreamy, wistful, inquiring.  \"We jest as the child jests,\" she says, abruptly, and walks onward.  \"I do not jest,\" says Brandolin.  The Babe glances at them under his thick eyelashes, and, being a _fine mouche_, only innocent in appearance, he runs off after a butterfly. He has not been brought up in a feminine atmosphere of _poudre de riz_ and _lait d'iris_ without learning discretion.     CHAPTER XIII.   \"The Babe is a better courtier than gardener,\" says Xenia Sabaroff, as she shakes a green aphis out of her rose: her tone is careless, but her voice is not quite under her command, and has a little tremor in it.  Brandolin looks at her with impassioned eyes: he has grown very pale.  \"It is no jest with me,\" he says, under his breath. \"I would give you my life if you would take it?\"  The last words have the accent of an interrogation, of an appeal.  \"That is to say a great deal,\" replies Xenia Sabaroff: she is startled, astonished, troubled; she was not expecting any such entire avowal.  \"Many men must have said as much to you who have more to recommend them than I. Say something to me: what will you say?\"  She does not immediately reply; she looks on the ground, and absently traces patterns on the path with the end of her long walking-stick.  \"Do you know,\" she says, at last, after a silence which seems to him endless, \"do you know that there are people who believe that I have been the _dlaisse_ of Lord Gervase? They do not phrase it so roughly, but that is what they say.\"  Brandolin's very lips are white, but his voice does not falter for one moment as he answers, \"They will not say it in my hearing.\"  \"And, knowing that they say it, you would still offer me your name?\"  \"I do so.\"  \"And you would ask me nothing save what I choose to tell you?\"  The sunny air seems to turn round with him for an instant: his brain grows dizzy; his heart contracts with a sickening pain; but in the next moment a great wave of strong and perfect faith in the woman he cares for lifts his soul up on it, as a sea-wave lifts a drowning man to land.  \"You shall tell me nothing save what you choose,\" he says, clearly and very tenderly. \"I have perfect faith in you. Had I less than that, I would not ask you to be my wife.\"  She looks at him with astonishment and with wondering admiration.  \"Yet you know so little of me!\" she murmurs, in amaze.  \"I love you,\" says Brandolin; then he kisses her hand with great reverence.  The tears which she had thought driven from her eyes forever, rise in them now.  \"You are very noble,\" she replies, and leaves her hand for an instant within his.  The Babe, who has been watching from behind a tuft of laurel, can control his impatience no longer, but comes out of his ambush and runs towards them, regardless of how undesired he may be.  \"Dodo says that women never marry anybody they love,\" he says, breathlessly; \"but that is not true, is it, and you will let me carry your train?\"  \"Hush, my dear,\" says Xenia Sabaroff, laying her hand on the child's shoulder, while there is a sound in her voice which subdues to silence even the audacious spirit of the Babe.  \"Give me time to think,\" she says, in a low tone to Brandolin; and then, with her hand still on the little boy's shoulder, she turns away from him and walks slowly towards the house.  The child walks silently and shyly beside her, his happy vanity troubled for once by the sense that he has made some mistake, and that there are some few things still in the universe which he does not quite entirely understand.  \"You are not angry?\" he asks her, at last, with a vague terror in his gay and impudent little soul.  \"Angry with you?\" says Xenia Sabaroff. \"My dear child, no. I am perhaps angry with myself,--myself of many years ago.\"  The Babe is silent: he does not venture to ask any more, and he has a humiliating feeling that he is not first in the thoughts of Madame Sabaroff,--nay, that, though his rose is in her gown and her hand upon his shoulder, she has almost, very nearly almost, forgotten him.  Brandolin does not attempt to follow her. Her great charm for him consists in the power she possesses of compelling him to control his impulses. He walks away by himself through the green shadows of the boughs, wishing for no companionship save hers. He is fully aware that he has done a rash, perhaps an utterly unwise, thing in putting his future into the hands of a woman of whom he knows so little, and has, perhaps, the right to suspect so much. Yet he does not repent.  He does not see her again before dinner. She does not come into the library at the tea-hour; there is a large dinner that night; county people are there, as well as the house-party. He has to take in a stupid woman, wife of the Lord-Lieutenant, who thinks him the most absent-minded and unpleasant person she has ever known, and wonders how he has got his reputation as a wit. He is so seated that he cannot even see Xenia Sabaroff, and he chafes and frets throughout the dinner, from the bisque soup to the caviare biscuit, and thinks what an idiotic thing the habits of society have made of human life.  When he is fairly at rare intervals goaded into speech, he utters paradoxes, and suggests views so startling that the wife of the Lord-Lieutenant is scandalized, and thinks the lunacy laws are defective if they cannot include and incarcerate him. She feels sure that the rumor about the Hindoo women at St. Hubert's Lea is entirely true.  After dinner he is free to approach the lady of his thoughts, but he endeavors in vain to tell from her face what answer he will receive, what time and meditation may have done or undone for him. She avoids the interrogation of his eyes, and is surrounded by other men as usual.  The evening seems to him intolerably long and intolerably tedious. It is, however, for others very gay. There is an improvised dance, ending in an impromptu cotillion, and following on an act of a comic opera given with admirable spirit by Lady Dawlish, Mrs. Curzon, and some of the younger men. Every one is amused, but the hours seem very slow to him: Gervase scarcely leaves her side at all, and Brandolin, with all his chivalrous refusal and unchanging resolution to allow no shadow of doubt to steal over him, feels the odious whispers he has heard and the outspoken words of Litroff recur to his memory and weigh on him like the incubus of a nightmare. With a sensation of dread, he realizes that it is possible, do what he may, that they may haunt him so all his life. A man may be always master of his acts, but scarcely always of his thoughts.  \"But I will never ask her one syllable,\" he thinks, \"and I will marry her to-morrow if she chooses.\"  But will she choose?  He is far from sure. He pleases her intelligence; he possesses her friendship; but whether he has the slightest power to touch her heart he does not know. If he loved her less than he does he would be more confident.  As the interminable hours wear away, and the noise and absurdities of the cotillion are at their height, she, who never dances anywhere, drops her fan, and he is before the others in restoring it to her. As she takes it, she says, in a low voice, \"Be in the small library at eleven to-morrow.\"  Soon after she leaves the ball-room altogether, and goes to her bedchamber.  Brandolin goes to his before the cotillion is over, but he sleeps very little. He longs for the morrow, and yet he dreads it. \"_Quand mme_,\" he murmurs, as from his bed he sees the white dawn over the dark masses of the Surrenden woods. Tell him what she may, he thinks, he will give her his life if she will take it. He is madly in love, no doubt; but there is something nobler and purer than the madness of love, than the mere violent instincts of passion, in his loyalty to her. Before anything he cherishes the honor of his name and race, and he is willing, blindfold, to trust her with it.  That morning it seems to him as if the hours would never pass, though they are few until the clocks strike eleven. The house is still, almost every one is asleep, for the cotillion, successful as only unpremeditated things ever are, had lasted till the sun was high and the dew on the grass of the garden was dry.  With a thickly-beating heart, nervous and eager as though he were a boy of sixteen seeking his first love-tryst, he enters the small library far before the hour, and waits for her there, pacing to and fro the floor. The room is full of memories of her: here they have talked on rainy days and have strolled out on to the lawns on fine ones; there is the chair which she likes best, and there the volume she had taken down yesterday; could it be only ten days since standing here he had seen her first in the distance with the children? Only ten days! It seems to him ten years, ten centuries.  The morning is very still, a fine soft rain is falling, wet jessamine-flowers tap against the panes of the closed windows, a great apprehension seems to make his very heart stand still.  As the clock points to the hour she enters the room.  She is very pale, and wears a morning gown of white plush, which trails behind her in a silver shadow. He kisses her hands passionately, but she draws them away.  \"Wait a little,\" she says, gently. \"Wait till you know--whatever there is to know.\"  \"I want to know but one thing.\"  She smiles a little sadly.  \"Oh, you think so now because you are in love with me. But in time to come, when that is passed, you will not be so easily content. If\"--she hesitates a moment--\"if there is to be any community between our lives, you must be quite satisfied as to my past. It is your right to be so satisfied; and were you not so, some time or other we should both be wretched.\"  His eyes flash with joy.  \"Then----\" he begins breathlessly.  \"Oh! how like a man that is!\" she says, sadly. \"To think but of the one thing, of the one present moment, and to be ready to give all the future in pawn for it! Wait to hear everything. And first of all I must tell you that Lord Gervase also last night asked me to marry him.\"  \"And you!\"  \"I shall not marry Lord Gervase. But I will not disguise from you that once I would have done so gladly, had I been free to do it.\"  Brandolin is silent: he changes color.  \"I bade him come here for my answer,\" she continues. \"He will be here in a few minutes. I wish you to remain in the large library, so that you may hear all that I say to him.\"  \"I cannot do that. I cannot play the part of eavesdropper.\"  \"You will play that part, or any other that I ask you, if you love me,\" she says, with a touch of imperiousness.  \"Do you not see,\" she goes on, with more gentleness, \"that if our lives are to be passed near each other (I do not say that they are, but you seem to wish it), you must first of all be convinced of the truth of all I tell you? If one doubt, one suspicion, remain, you will, in time, become unable to banish it. It would grow and grow until you were mastered by it. You believe in what I tell you now; but how long would you believe after marriage?\"  \"I want no proof: I only want your word. Nay, I do not even want that. I will ask you nothing. I swear that I will never ask you anything.\"  \"That is very beautiful; and I am sure that you mean it now. But it could not last. You are a very proud man; you are _gentilhomme de race_. It would in time become intolerable to you if you believed that any one living man had any title to point a finger of scorn at you. You have a right to know what my relations were with Lord Gervase: it is necessary for all the peace of our future that you should know everything,--know that there is nothing more left for you to know. You can only be convinced of that if you yourself hear what I say to him. Go; and wait there.\"  Brandolin hesitates. To listen unseen is a part which seems very cowardly to him, and yet she is right, no doubt; all the peace of the future may depend on it. He is ready to pledge himself blindly in the dark in all ways, but he knows that she, in forbidding him to do so, speaks the word of wisdom, of foresight, and of truth.  \"Go,\" she repeats. \"Men have a thousand ways of proving the truth of whatever they say; we have none, or next to none. If you refuse me this, the sole poor evidence that I can produce, I will never be to you anything that you now wish. Never; that I swear to you.\"  He hesitates, and looks at her with a long inquiring regard. Then he bows, and goes.  After all, she is within her rights. She has no other means to show him with any proof what this man whose name is so odiously entangled with her own has, or has not, been to her.  The house is still quite silent, and no one is likely to come into those rooms until much later. Every syllable said in the small library can be heard in any part of the larger one. He stands in the embrasure of one of the windows, the velvet curtains making a screen behind him. He seems to wait for hours; in reality only five minutes have passed when he hears the door of the great library open, and Gervase passes quickly through the apartment without seeing him, and goes on into the one where she awaits his coming.  \"Are you really risen so early?\" she says, with a sarcastic coldness in her voice. \"I remembered afterwards that it was too cruel to name to you any hour before noon.\"  \"You are unkind,\" he answers. \"To hear what I hope to hear, you may be sure that I would have gone through much greater trials than even rising with the lark, had you commanded it.\"  His words are light, but his accent is tender and appealing.  \"What do you hope to hear?\" she asks, abruptly. The question embarrasses him and sounds cold.  \"I hope to hear that you pardon me the past and will deign to crown my future.\"  \"I pardon you the past, certainly. With neither your present nor your future have I anything to do.\"  \"You say that very cruelly,--so cruelly that it makes your forgiveness more unkind than your hatred would be.\"  \"I intend no unkindness. I merely wish to express indifference. Perhaps I am even mistaken in saying that I entirely forgive you. When I remember that you once possessed any influence over me, I scarcely do forgive you, for I am forced to despise myself.\"  \"Those are very hard words! Perhaps in the past I was unworthy of having known and loved you; but if you will believe in my regret, and allow me occasion to atone, you shall never repent of your indulgence. Pray hear me out, Xenia----\"  \"You cannot call me by that name. It is for my friends: you are not numbered among them.\"  \"I would be much more than your friend. If you will be my wife.\"  \"It is too late,\" she replies, and her voice is as cold as ice.  \"Why too late? We have all the best of our lives unspent before us.\"  \"When I say too late, I mean that if you had said as much to me after the death of Prince Sabaroff I should have accepted your hand, and I should have spent the whole remainder of my existence in repenting that I had done so; for I should soon have fathomed the shallowness of your character, the artificiality and poverty of your sentiments, the falseness of your mind, and I should speedily have hated both myself and you.\"  \"You are not merciful, madame!\"  He is bitterly humbled and passionately incensed.  \"Were you merciful?\" she asks him, with the sound of a great anger, carefully controlled, vibrating in her voice. \"I was a child, taken out of a country convent, and married as ignorantly as a bird is trapped. I had rank, and I was burdened by it. I was in a great world, a great court, and I was terrified by them. The man I had been given to was a gambler, a drunkard, and a brute. He treated me in private as he had treated the women captured in Turkestan or sold as slaves in Persia. You knew that: you were his intimate associate. You used your opportunities to interest me and win your way into my confidence. I had no one in the whole world that I could trust. I did trust you.\"  She pauses a moment.  Gervase does not dare reply.  \"You were so gentle, so considerate, so full of sympathy; I thought you a very angel. A girl of sixteen or seventeen sees the face of St. John in the first Faust who finds his way into her shut soul! You made me care for you; I do not deny it. But why did I care? Because I saw in you the image of a thousand things you were not. Because I imagined that my own fanciful ideal existed in you, and you had the ability to foster the illusion.\"  \"But why recall all this?\" he says, entreatingly. \"Perhaps I was unworthy of your innocent attachment, of your exalted imaginations; I dare not say that I was not; but now that I meet you again, now that I care for you ten thousand--ten million times more----\"  \"What is that to me?\" she says, with almost insolent coldness. \"It was not I who loved you, but a child who knew no better, and whose heart was so bleeding from the tortures of another man that the first hand which soothed it could take it as one takes a wounded bird! But when my eyes opened to your drift and your desires, when I saw that you were no better than other men, that you tried to tempt me to the lowest forms of intrigue under cover of your friendship with my husband, then, child though I was, I saw you as you were, and I hid myself from you! You thought that Sabaroff exiled me from his jealousy of you to the northern estates; but it was not so. I entreated him to let me leave Petersburg, and he had grown tired of torturing me and let me go.\"  \"You blame me for being merely human. I loved you not better but not worse than men do love.\"  \"I blame you for having been insincere, treacherous, dishonest. You approached me under cover of the most delicate and forbearing sympathy and reverence, and you only wore those masks to cover the vulgar designs of a most commonplace Lothario. Of course, now I know that one must not play with fire unless one is willing to be burned. I did not know it then. I was a stupid, unhappy, trembling child, full of poetic fancies, and alone in a dissolute crowd. When you could not make me what you wished to make me, I seemed very tame and useless to you. You turned to more facile women, no doubt, and you left Russia.\"  \"I left Russia under orders; and I wrote to you. I wrote to you repeatedly. You never answered.\"  \"No; I had no wish to answer you. I had seen you as you were, and the veil had fallen from my eyes. I burnt your letters as they came to me. But after the death of Prince Sabaroff you were careful to write no more.\"  Gervase colors hotly; there is an accent in the words which makes them strike him like whips.  \"If you had written to me after that,\" she continues, \"perhaps I should have answered you; perhaps not: I cannot tell. When you knew that I was set free you were silent; you stayed away, I know not where. I never saw you again; I never heard from you again. Now I thank you for your neglect and oblivion, but at the time I confess that it made me suffer. I was very young still, and romantic. For a while I expected every month which melted the snow would bring you back. So much I admit, though it will flatter you.\"  It does not flatter him as she says it; rather it wounds him. He has a hateful sense of his own impotency to stir her one hand's breadth, to breathe one spark of warmth into those ashes gone cold forever.  \"I do not think,\" she continues, \"that I ever loved you in the sense that women can love; but you had the power to make me suffer, to feel your oblivion, to remember you when you had forgotten me. When I went into the world again I heard of your successes with others, and gradually I came to see you in your true light, and, almost, the drunken brutality of Prince Sabaroff seemed to me a manlier thing than your half-hearted and shallow erotics had been. Now, when we meet again by pure hazard in the same country house, you do me the honor to offer me your hand after eight years. I can only say, as I have said before, that it is seven years too late!\"  \"Too late, only because Lord Brandolin now is everything to you.\"  \"Lord Brandolin may possibly be something to me in the future. But, if Lord Brandolin did not exist, if no other living man existed, be sure that it would make no difference to me--or to you.\"  \"Is that your last word?\"  \"Yes.\"  Pale and agitated as no other woman had ever seen him, Gervase bows low and leaves her abruptly, pushing open one of the glass doors on to the garden and closing it with a clash behind him.  Xenia Sabaroff goes towards the large library, her silvery train catching the lights and shadows as she goes.  Brandolin meets her with his hands outstretched.  \"You are content, then?\" she asks.  \"I am more than content,--if I may be allowed to atone to you for all that you have suffered.\"  His own eyes are dim as he speaks.  \"But you know that the world will always say that he was my lover?\"  \"I do not think that the world will say it--of my wife; but, if it do, I, at least, shall not be troubled.\"  \"You have a great nature,\" she says, with deep emotion.  Brandolin smiles. \"Oh, I cannot claim so much as that; but I have a great love.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I'm awfully glad that prig's got spun,\" says George Usk, as Gervase receives a telegram from the Foreign Office which requires his departure from Surrenden at four o'clock that afternoon.  \"Spun! What imagination!\" says his wife, very angrily. \"Who should have spun him, pray will you tell me?\"  \"We shall never hear it in so many words,\" says Usk, with a grim complacency, \"but I'll swear, if I die for it, that he's asked your Russian friend to marry him and that she's said she won't. Very wise of her, too. Especially if, as you imply, they carried on together years ago: he'd be eternally throwing it in her teeth: he's what the Yanks call a 'tarnation mean cuss.'\"  \"I never implied anything of the sort,\" answers the lady of Surrenden, with great decorum and dignity. \"I never suppose that all my friends are all they ought to be, whatever _yours_ may leave to be desired. If he were attached long ago to Madame Sabaroff, it is neither your affair nor mine. It may possibly concern Lord Brandolin, if he have the intentions which you attribute to him.\"  \"Brandolin can take care of himself,\" says Usk, carelessly. \"He knows the time of day as well as anybody, and I don't know why you should be rough on it, my lady: it will be positively refreshing if anybody marries after one of your house-parties; they generally only get divorced after them.\"  \"The Waverleys are very good friends still, I believe,\" says Dorothy Usk, coldly.  The reply seems irrelevant, but to the ear of George Usk it carries considerable relevancy.  He laughs a little nervously. \"Oh, yes: so are we, aren't we?\"  \"Certainly,\" says the mistress of Surrenden.         *       *       *       *       *  At the first Drawing-room this year, the admired of all eyes, and the centre of all comment, is the Lady Brandolin.     DON GESUALDO.     CHAPTER I.   It was a day in June.  The crickets were chirping, the lizards were gliding, the butterflies were flying above the ripe corn, the reapers were out among the wheat, and the tall stalks were swaying and falling under the sickle. Through the little windows of his sacristy Don Gesualdo, the young vicar of San Bartolo, in the village of Marca, looked with wistful eyes at the hill-side which rose up in front of him, seen through a frame of cherry-boughs in full fruit. The hill-side was covered with corn, with vines, with mulberry-trees; the men and women were at work among the trees, it was the first day of harvest; there was a blue, happy sky above them all; their voices chattering and calling to one another over the sea of grain came to his ears gayly and softened by air and distance. He sighed as he looked and as he heard. Yet, interrogated, he would have said that he was happy and wanted for nothing.  He was a slight, pale man, still almost a youth, with a delicate face without color and beardless; his eyes were brown and tender and serious, his mouth was sensitive and sweet. He was the son of a fisherman away by Bocca d'Arno, where the river meets the sea, amidst the cane- and cactus-brakes which Costa loves to paint. But who could say what fine, time-filtered, pure Etruscan or Latin blood might not run in his veins? There is so much of the classic features and the classic form among the peasants of Tyrrhene sea-shores, of Cimbrian oak woods, of Roman grass-plains, of Maremma marshes.  It was the last day of peace which he was destined to know in Marca.  He turned from the window with reluctance and regret, as the old woman who served him as housekeeper and church-cleaner in one summoned him to his frugal supper. He could have supped at any hour he had chosen, there were none to say him nay, but it was the custom at Marca to sup at the twenty-third hour, and he was not a person to violate custom: he would as soon have thought of spitting on the blessed bread itself. Habit is a masterful ruler in all Italian communities; it has always been so; it is a formula which excuses all things and sanctifies all things, and to none did it do so more than to Gesualdo. Often he was not in the least hungry at sunset, often he grudged sorely the hours spent in breaking black bread and in eating poor soup when Nature was at her sweetest and the skies giving their finest spectacle to a thankless earth. Yet never did he fail to meekly answer old Candida's summons to the humble repast. To have altered the hour of eating would have seemed to him irreligious, revolutionary, altogether impossible.  Candida was a little old woman, burnt black by the sun, with a wisp of gray hair fastened on the crown of her head, and a neater look about her kerchief and her gown than was usual in Marca, for she was a woman originally from a Northern city. She had always been a servant in priests' houses, and, if the sacristan were ill or away, knew as well as he where every book, bell, and candle were kept, and could have said the offices herself had her sex allowed her. In tongue she was very sharp, and in secret was proud of the power she possessed in making the vicegerent of God afraid of her. The priest was the first man in this parish of poor folks, and the priest would shrink like a chidden child if she found out that he had given his best shirt to a beggar, or had inadvertently come in with wet boots over the brick floor which she had just washed and sanded. It was the old story of so many sovereignties. He had power, no doubt, to bind and loose, to bless and curse, to cleanse or refuse to cleanse the sinful souls of men; but for all that he was only a stupid, forgetful baby of a man in his servant's eyes, and she made him feel the scorn she had for him, mixed up with a half-motherly, half-scolding admiration, which saw in him half a child, half a fool, and, maybe she would add in her own thoughts, a kind of angel.  Don Gesualdo was not wise or learned in any way: he had barely been able to acquire enough knowledge to pass through the examinations necessary for entrance into the priesthood. That slender amount of scholarship was his all; but he was clever enough for Marca, which had very little brains of its own, and he did his duty most faithfully, as far as he saw it, at all times. As for doubts of any sort as to what that duty was, such scepticism never could possibly assail him. His creed appeared as plain and sure to him as the sun which shone in the heavens, and his faith was as single-hearted and unswerving as the devoted soul of a docile sheep-dog.  He was of a poetic and retiring nature; religion had taken entire possession of his soul, and he was as unworldly, as visionary, and as simple as any one of the _peccarelle di Dio_ who dwelt around Francesco d'Assisci. His mother had been a German servant-girl, married out of a small inn in Pisa, and some qualities of the dreamy, slow, and serious Teutonic temperament were in him, all Italian of the western coast as he was. On such a dual mind the spiritual side of his creed had obtained intense power; and the office he filled was to him a heaven-given mission, which compelled him to incessant sacrifice of every earthly appetite and every selfish thought.  \"He is too good to live,\" said his old housekeeper.  It was a very simple and monotonous life which was led by him in his charge. There was no kind of change in it for anybody, unless they went away, and few people born in Marca ever did that. They were not forced by climate to be nomads, like the mountaineers of the Apennines, nor like the men of the sea-coast and ague-haunted plains. Marca was a healthy, homely place on the slope of a hill in the wilderness, where its sons and daughters could stay and work all the year round, if they chose, without risk of fever worse than such as might be brought on by too much new wine at close of autumn. Marca was not pretty, nor historical, nor picturesque, nor uncommon in any way: there are five hundred, five thousand, villages like it, standing among corn-lands and maize-fields and mulberry-trees, with its little dark church, and its whitewashed presbytery, and its dusky red-tiled houses, and its great silent empty villa, that used to be a fortified and stately palace and now is given over to the rats and the spiders and the scorpions. A very quiet little place, far away from cities and railways, dusty and uncomely in itself, but blessed in the abundant light and the divine landscape which are around it, and of which no one in it ever thought, except this simple young priest, Gesualdo Brasalo.  Of all natural gifts, a love of natural beauty surely brings most happiness to the possessor of it,--happiness altogether unalloyed and unpurchasable, and created by the mere rustle of green leaves, the mere ripple of brown waters. It is not an Italian gift at all, nor an Italian feeling; to an Italian, gas is more beautiful than sunshine, and a cambric flower more beautiful than a real one; he usually thinks the mountains hateful and a city divine, he detests trees and adores crowds. But there are exceptions to all rules: there are poetic natures everywhere, though everywhere rare: Gesualdo was the exception in Marca and its neighborhood, and evening after evening saw him in the summer weather strolling through the fields, his breviary in his hand, but his heart with the dancing fire-flies, the quivering poplar leaves, the tall green cane, the little silvery fish darting over the white stones of the shallow river-waters. He could not have told why he loved to watch these things: he thought it was because they reminded him of Bocca d'Arno and the sand-beach and the canebrakes; but he did love them, and they filled him with that vague emotion, half pleasure, half pain, known to all who love Nature for herself alone.  His supper over, he went into his church: a little, red-bricked, whitewashed passage connected it with his parlor. The church was small, and dark, and old; it had an altar-piece said to be old, and by a Sienese master, and of some value, but Gesualdo knew nothing of these matters: a Raphael might have hung there and he would have been none the wiser. He loved the church, ugly and simple as it was, as a mother loves a plain child or a dull one because it is hers; and now and then he preached strange, passionate, pathetic sermons in it, which none of his people understood, and which he barely understood himself. He had a sweet, full, far-reaching voice, with an accent of singular melancholy in it, and as his mystical, romantic, involved phrases passed far over the heads of his hearers, like a flight of birds flying high up against the clouds, the pathos and music in his tones stirred their hearts vaguely. He was certainly, they thought, a man whom the saints loved. Candida, sitting near the altar with her head bowed and her hands feeling her rosary, would think, as she heard the unintelligible eloquence, \"Dear Lord, all that power of words, all that skill of the tongue, and he would put his shirt on bottom upward were it not for me!\"  There was no office in his church that evening, but he lingered about it, touching this thing and the other with tender fingers. There was always a sweet scent in the little place: its door usually stood open to the fields amidst which it was planted, and the smell of the incense which century after century had been burned in it blended with the fragrance from primroses, or dog-roses, or new-mown hay, or crushed ripe grapes, which, according to the season, came in it from without. Candida kept it very clean, and the scorpions and spiders were left so little peace there by her everactive broom that they betook themselves elsewhere, dear as the wooden benches and the crannied stones had been to them for ages.  Since he had come to Marca nothing of any kind had happened in it. There had been some marriages, a great many births, not a few burials; but that was all. The people who came to confession at Easter confessed very common sins: they had stolen this or that, cheated here, there, and everywhere, got drunk and quarrelled, nothing more: he would give them clean bills of spiritual health, and bid them go in peace and sin no more, quite sure, as they were sure themselves, that they would have the self-same sins to tell off next time they came there.  Everybody in Marca thought a great deal of their religion; that is, they trusted to it in a helpless but confident kind of way as a fetich which, being duly and carefully propitiated, would make things all right for them after death. They would not have missed a mass to save their lives: that they dozed through it, and cracked nuts or took a suck at their pipe-stems when they woke, did not affect their awed and unchangeable belief in its miraculous and saving powers. If they had been asked what they believed, or why they believed, they would have scratched their heads and felt puzzled. Their minds dwelt in a twilight in which nothing had any distinct form. The clearest idea ever presented to them was that of the Madonna: they thought of her as of some universal mother who wanted to do them good in present and future if they only observed her ceremonials: just as in the ages gone by upon these same hill-sides the Latin peasant had thought of the great Demeter.  Gesualdo himself, despite all the doctrine which had been instilled into him in his novitiate, did not know much more than they: he repeated the words of his offices without any distinct notion of all that they meant; he had a vague feeling that all self-denial and self-sacrifice were thrice blessed, and he tried his best to save his own soul and the souls of others; but there he ceased to think: outside that speculation lay, and speculation was a thrice-damnable offence. Yet he, being imaginative and intelligent in a humble and dog-like way, was at times infinitely distressed to see how little effect this religion which he taught and which they professed had upon the lives of his people. His own life was altogether guided by it: why could not theirs be the same? Why did they go on all through the year swearing, cursing, drinking, quarrelling, lying, stealing? He could not but perceive that they came to him to confess their peccadilloes only that they might pursue them more completely at their ease. He could not flatter himself that his ministrations in Marca, which were now of six years' duration, had made the village a whit different from what it had been when he had entered it.  Thinking of this, as he did think of it continually night and day, being a man of singularly sensitive conscience, he sat down on a marble bench near the door and opened his breviary. The sun was setting behind the pines on the crest of the hills; the warm orange light poured across the paved way in front of the church, through the stems of the cypresses which stood before the door, and found its way over the uneven slates of the stone floor to his feet. A nightingale was singing somewhere in the dog-rose hedge beyond the cypress-trees. Lizards ran from crack to crack in the pavement. A tendril of honeysuckle came through a hole in the wall, thrusting its delicate curled horns of perfume towards him. The whole entrance was bathed in golden warmth and light; the body of the church behind him was quite dark.  He had opened his breviary from habit, but he did not read: he sat and gazed at the evening clouds, at the blue hills, at the radiant air, and listened to the song of the nightingales in that dreamy trance which made him look so stupid in the eyes of his housekeeper and his parishioners, but which was only the meditation of a poetic temper, cramped and cooped up in a narrow and uncongenial existence, and not educated or free enough to be able even to analyze what it felt.  \"The nightingale's song in June is altogether unlike its songs of April and May,\" thought this poor priest, whom Nature had made a poet, and to whom she had given the eyes which see and the ears which hear. \"The very phrases are wholly different; the very accent is not the same: in spring it is all a canticle like the Song of Solomon, in midsummer--what is it he is singing? Is he lamenting the summer? or is he only teaching his young ones how they should sing next year?\"  And he fell again to listening to the sweetest bird that gladdens earth. The nightingale was patiently repeating his song, again and again, sometimes more slowly, sometimes more quickly, seeming to lay stress on some phrases more than on others; and another voice, fainter and feebler than his own, repeated the trills and roulades after him fitfully, and often breaking down altogether. It was plain that there in the wild-rose hedge he was teaching his son. Any one who will may hear these sweet lessons given under bays and myrtle, under arbutus and pomegranate, through all the month of June.  Nightingales in Marca were only regarded as creatures to be trapped, shot, caged, eaten, sold for a centime like any other small bird; but about the church no one touched them: the people knew that their _parocco_ cared to hear their songs coming sweetly through the pauses in the recitatives of the office. Absorbed as he was now in hearkening to the music-lesson among the white dog-roses, he started violently as a shadow fell across the threshold and a voice called to him, \"Good-evening, Don Gesualdo.\"  He looked up and saw a woman whom he knew well,--a young woman, scarcely indeed eighteen years old, very handsome, with a face full of warmth and color and fire and tenderness, great flashing eyes which could at times be as soft as a dog's, and a beautiful ruddy mouth with teeth as white as a dog's are also. She was by name Generosa F: she was the wife of Tasso Tassilo, the miller. In Marca, most of the women by toil and sun were black as berries by the time they were twenty, and looked old almost before they were young, with rough hair and loose forms and wrinkled skins, and children dragging at their breasts all the year through. Generosa was not like them: she did little work; she had the form of a goddess; she took care of her beauty, and she had no children, though she had married at fifteen. She was friends with Gesualdo; they had both come from the Bocca d'Arno, and it was a link of common memory and mutual attachment. They liked to recall how they had each run through the tall canes and cactus, and waded in the surf, and slept in the hot sand, and hidden themselves for fright when the king's camels had come towards them, throwing their huge misshapen shadows over the seas of flowering reeds and rushes.  He remembered her a small child, jumping about on the sand and laughing at him, a youth, when he was going to college to study for entrance into the Church. \"Gesualdo! ch Gesualdo!\" she had cried. \"A fine priest he will make for us all to confess to!\" And she had screamed with mirth, her handsome little face rippling all over with gayety like the waves of the sea with the sunshine.  He had remembered her, and had been glad when Tasso Tassilo, the miller, had gone sixty miles away for a wife, and had brought her from the Bocca d'Arno to live at the mill on the small river which was the sole water that ran through the village of Marca.  Tasso Tassilo, going on business once to the sea-coast, had chanced to see that handsome face of hers, and had wooed and won her without great difficulty, for her people were poor folk, living by carting sand, and she herself was tired of her bare legs and face, her robust hunger, which made her glad to eat the fruit off the cactus-plants, and her great beauty, which nobody ever saw except the sea-gulls and carters and fishers and cane-cutters, who were all as poor as she was herself.  Tasso Tassilo, in his own person, she hated, an ugly, dry, elderly man, with his soul wrapped up in his flour-bags and his money-bags; but he adored her, and let her spend as she chose on her attire and her ornaments; and the mill-house was a pleasant place enough with its walls painted on the outside _in tempora_, and the willows drooping over its eaves, and the young men and the mules loitering about on the land-side of it, and the peasants coming up with corn to be ground whenever there had been rain in summer and so water enough in the river-bed to turn the mill-wheels. In drought the stream was low and its stones dry and no work could be done by the grindstones. There was then only water enough for the ducks to paddle in, and the pretty teal to float in, which they would always do at sunrise unless the miller let fly a a charge of small shot among them from the windows under the roof.  \"Good-evening, Don Gesualdo,\" said the miller's wife now, in the midst of the nightingale's song and the orange glow from the sunset.  Gesualdo rose with a smile. He was always glad to see her. She had something about her for him of boyhood, of home, of the sea, and of the careless days before he became a seminarist: he did not positively regret that he had entered the priesthood, but he remembered the earlier life wistfully, and with wonder that he could ever have been that light-hearted lad who had run through the canebrakes to plunge into the rolling waters with all the wide gay sunlit world of sea and sky and river and shore before him, behind him, and above him.  \"What is wrong, Generosa?\" he asked her, seeing as he looked up that her handsome face was clouded. Her days were not often tranquil; her husband was jealous, and she gave him cause for jealousy: the mill was a favorite resort of all the young men for thirty miles around, and unless Tasso Tassilo had ceased to grind corn he could not have shut his doors to them.  \"It is the old story, Don Gesualdo,\" she answered, leaning against the church porch. \"You know what Tasso, is and what a dog's life he leads me.\" \"You are not always prudent, my daughter,\" said Gesualdo, with a faint smile.  \"Who could be always prudent at my years?\" said the miller's young wife. \"Tasso is a brute, and a fool too. One day he will drive me out of myself: I tell him so.\"  \"That is not the way to make him better,\" said Gesualdo. \"I am sorry you do not see it. The man loves you, and he feels he is old, and he knows that you do not care: that is always like a thorn in his flesh: he feels you do not care.\"  \"How should he suppose that I care?\" said Generosa, passionately. \"I hated him always; he is as old as my father; he expects me to be shut up like a nun; if he had his own way I should never stir out of the house: does one marry for that?\"  \"One should marry to do one's duty,\" said Gesualdo, timidly, for he felt the feebleness of his counsels and arguments against the force and the warmth and the self-will of a woman, conscious of her beauty and her power and her lovers, and moved by all the instincts of vanity and passion.  \"We had a terrible scene an hour ago,\" said Generosa, passing over what she did not choose to answer. \"It cost me much not to put a knife into him. It was about Falko. There was nothing new, but he thought there was. I fear he will do Falko mischief one day: he threatened it: it is not the first time.\"  \"That is very grave,\" said Gesualdo, growing paler as he heard. \"My daughter, you are more in error than Tassilo. After all, he has his rights. Why do you not send the young man away? He would obey you.\"  \"He would obey me in anything else, not in that,\" said the woman, with the little conscious smile of one who knows her own power. \"He would not go away. Indeed, why should he go away? He has his employment here. Why should he go away because Tasso is a jealous fool?\"  \"Is he such a fool?\" said Gesualdo, and he raised his eyes suddenly and looked straight into hers. Generosa colored through her warm, paleless skin. She was silent.  \"It has not gone as far as you think,\" she muttered, after a pause.  \"But I will not be accused for nothing,\" she added. \"Tasso shall have what he thinks he has had. Why would he marry me? He knew I hated him. We were all very poor down there by Bocca d'Arno, but we were gay and happy. Why did he take me away?\"  The tears started to her eyes and rolled down her hot cheeks. It was the hundredth time that she had told her sorrows to Gesualdo, in the confessional and out of it: it was an old story, of which she never tired of the telling. Her own people were far away by the sea-shore, and she had no friends in Marca, for she was thought a \"foreigner,\" not being of that country-side, and the women were jealous of her beauty, and of the idle life which she led in comparison to theirs, and of the cared-for look of her person. Gesualdo seemed a countryman, and a relative, and a friend. She took all her woes to him. A priest was like a woman, she thought; only a still safer confidant.  \"You are ungrateful, my daughter,\" he said, now, with an effort to be severe in reprimand. \"You know that you were glad to marry so rich a man as Tassilo. You know that you father and mother were glad, and you yourself likewise. No doubt the man is not all that you could wish, but you owe him something; indeed, you owe him much. I speak to you now out of my office, only as a friend. I would entreat you to send your lover away. If not, there will be crime, perhaps bloodshed, and the fault of all that may happen will be yours.\"  She gave a gesture which said that she cared nothing, whatever might happen. She was in a headstrong and desperate mood; she had had a violent quarrel with her husband, and she loved Falko Melegari, the steward of the absent noble who owned the empty, half-ruined palace which stood on the banks of the river; he was a fair and handsome young man, with Lombard blood in him, tall, slender, vigorous, amorous and light-hearted,--the strongest of contrasts in all ways to Tasso Tassilo, taciturn, feeble, sullen, and unlovely, and twice the years of his wife.  There was not more than a mile between the mill-house and the deserted villa; Tassilo might as well have tried to arrest the sirocco or the mariner's winds, when they blew, as prevent an intercourse so favored and so facilitated by circumstances. The steward had a million reasons in a year to visit the mill, and when the miller insulted him and forbade him his doors he had no power to prevent him from fishing in the waters, from walking on the bank, from making signals from the villa terraces and appointments in the canebrakes and the vine-fields. Nothing could have broken off the intrigue except the departure of one or the other of the lovers from Marca. But Falko Melegari would not go away from a place where his interests and his passions both combined to hold him; and it never entered the mind of the miller to take his wife elsewhere. He had dwelt at the mill all the years of his life, and his forefathers for five generations before him. To change their residence never occurs to such people as these: they are fixed, like the cypress-trees, in the ground, and dream no more than they of new homes. Like the tree, they never change till death fells them. Generosa continued to pour out her woes, leaning against the pillar of the porch, and playing with a twig of pomegranate, whose buds were not more scarlet than her own lips; and Gesualdo continued to press on her his good counsels, knowing all the while that he might as well speak to the swallows under the church eaves, for any benefit that he could effect. In sole answer to the arguments of Gesualdo she retorted in scornful words.  \"You may find duty enough for you because you are a saint,\" she added, with less of reverence than of disdain; \"but I am no saint, and I will not spend all my best days tied to the side of a sickly and sullen old man.\"  \"You are wrong, my daughter,\" said Gesualdo, sternly. He colored; he knew not why. \"I know nothing of these passions,\" he added, with some embarrassment; \"but I know what duty is, and yours is clear.\"  He did not know much of human nature, and of woman nature nothing, yet he dimly comprehended that Generosa was now at that crisis of her life when all the ardors of her youth and all the delight in her own power made her passionately rebellious against the cruelties of her fate; when it was impossible to make duty look other than hateful to her, and when the very peril and difficulty which surrounded her love-story made it the sweeter and more irresistible to her. She was of a passionate, ardent, careless, daring temperament; and the dangers of the intrigue which she pursued had no terrors for her, whilst the indifference which she had felt for years for her husband had deepened of late into hatred.  \"One is not a stick, nor a stone, nor a beam of timber, nor a block of granite, that one should be able to live without love all one's days!\" she cried, with passion and contempt.  She threw the branches of pomegranate over the hedge, gave him a glance half contemptuous and half compassionate, and left the church door.  \"After all, what should he understand!\" she thought. \"He is a saint, but he is not a man.\"  Gesualdo looked after her a moment as she went over the court-yard and between the stems of the cypresses out towards the open hill-side. The sun had set; there was a rosy after-glow which bathed her elastic figure in a carmine light; she had that beautiful walk which some Italian women have who have never worn shoes in the first fifteen years of their lives. The light shone on her dusky auburn hair, her gold ear-rings, the slender column of her throat, her vigorous and voluptuous form. Gesualdo looked after her, and a subtile warmth and pain passed through him, bringing with it a sharp sense of guilt. He looked away from her and went within his church and prayed.  That night Falko Melegari had just alighted from the saddle of his good gray horse, when he was told that the parocco of San Bartolo was waiting to see him.  The villa had been famous and splendid in other days; but it formed now only one of the many neglected possessions of a gay young noble, called Ser Baldo by his dependents, who spent what little money he had in pleasure-places out of Italy, seldom or never came near his estates, and accepted without investigation all such statements of accounts as his various men of business were disposed to send to him.  His steward lived on the ground-floor of the great villa, in the vast frescoed chambers with their domed and gilded ceilings, their sculptured cornices, their carved doors, their stately couches with the satin dropping in shreds, and the pale tapestries with the moths and the mice at work in them. His narrow camp-bed, his deal table and chairs, were sadly out of place in those once splendid halls; but he did not think about it: he vaguely liked the space and the ruined grandeur about him, and all the thoughts he had were given to his love, Generosa, the wife of Tasso Tassilo. From the terraces of the villa he could see the mill a mile farther down the stream, and he would pass half the short nights of the summer looking at the distant lights in it.  He was only five-and-twenty, and he was passionately in love with all the increased ardor of a forbidden passion.  He was fair-haired and blue-eyed, was well-made and very tall; in character he was neither better nor worse than most men of his age, but as a steward he was tolerably honest, and as a lover he was thoroughly sincere. He went with a quick step into the central hall to meet his visitor: he supposed that the vicar had come about flowers for the feast of St. Peter and St. Paul, which was on the morrow. Though the villa gardens were wholly neglected, they were still rich in flowers which wanted no care, lilies, lavender, old-fashioned roses, oleanders red and white, and magnolia-trees.  \"Good-evening, reverend Father. You do me honor,\" he said, as he saw Gesualdo. \"Is there anything that I can do for you? I am your humble servant.\"  Gesualdo looked at him curiously. He had never noticed the young man before: he had seen him ride past, he had seen him at mass, he had spoken to him of the feasts of the Church, but he had never noticed him. Now he looked at him curiously as he answered, without any preface whatever,--  \"I am come to speak to you of Generosa F, the wife of Tasso Tassilo.\"  The young steward colored violently. He was astonished and silent.  \"She loves you,\" said Gesualdo, simply.  Falko Melegari made a gesture as though he implied that it was his place neither to deny nor to affirm.  \"She loves you,\" said Gesualdo, again.  The young man had that fatuous smile which unconsciously expresses the consciousness of conquest. But he was honest in his passion and ardent in it.  \"Not so much as I love her,\" he said, rapturously, forgetful of his hearer.  Gesualdo frowned.  \"She is the wife of another man,\" he said, with reproof. Falko Melegari shrugged his shoulders: that did not seem any reason against it to him.  \"How will it end?\" said the priest.  The lover smiled. \"These things always end in one way.\"  Gesualdo winced, as though some one had wounded him.  \"I am come to bid you go out of Marca,\" he said, simply.  The young man stared at him; then he laughed angrily.  \"Good Ser Vicario,\" he said, impatiently, \"you are the keeper of our souls, no doubt, but not quite to such a point as that. Has Tassilo sent you to me, or she?\" he added, with a gleam of suspicion in his eyes.  \"No one has sent me.\"  \"Why, then----\"  \"Because, if you do not go, there will be tragedy and misery. Tasso Tassilo is not a man to make you welcome to his couch. I have known Generosa since she was a little child: we were both born on the Bocca d'Arno. She is of a warm nature, but not a deep one; and if you go away she will forget. Tassilo is a rude man and a hard one; he gives her all she has; he has many claims on her, for in his way he has been generous and tender. You are a stranger; you can only ruin her life; you can with ease find another _gattaria_ far away in another province: why will you not go? If you really loved her you would go.\"  Falko laughed. \"Dear Don Gesualdo, you are a holy man, but you know nothing of love.\"  Gesualdo winced a little again. It was the second time this had been said to him this evening.  \"Is it love,\" he said, after a pause, \"to risk her murder by her husband? I tell you Tassilo is not a man to take his dishonor quietly.\"  \"Who cares what Tassilo does?\" said the young steward, petulantly. \"If he touches a hair of her head I will make him die a thousand deaths.\"  \"All those are words,\" said Gesualdo. \"You cannot mend one crime by another, and you cannot protect a woman from her husband's just vengeance. There is only one way by which to save her from the danger you have dragged her into. It is for you to go away.\"  \"I will go away when this house walks a mile,\" said Falko. \"Not before. Go away!\" he echoed, in wrath. \"What! run like a mongrel dog before Tassilo's anger? What! leave her all alone to curse me as a faithless coward? What! go away, when all my life and my soul, and all the light of my eyes, is in Marca? Don Gesualdo, you are a good man, but you are mad. You must pardon me if I speak roughly. Your words make me beside myself.\"  \"Do you believe in no duty, then?\"  \"I believe in the duty of every honest lover,\" said Falko, with vehemence, \"and that duty is to do everything that the loved one wishes. She is bound to a cur; she is unhappy; she has not even any children to comfort her; she is like a beautiful flower shut up in a cellar, and she loves me--me!--and you bid me go away! Don Gesualdo, keep to your church offices, and leave the loves of others alone. What should you know of them? Forgive me if I am rude. You are a holy man, but you know nothing at all of men and women.\"  \"I do not know much,\" said Gesualdo, meekly.  He was depressed and intimidated. He was sensible of his own utter ignorance of the passions of life. This man, nigh his own age, but so full of vigor, of ardor, of indignation, of pride in his consciousness that he was beloved, and of resolve to stay where that love was, be the cost what it would, daunted him with a sense of power and of triumph such as he himself could not even comprehend, and yet wistfully envied. It was sin, no doubt, he said to himself; and yet it was life, it was strength, it was virility.  He had come to reprove, to censure, and to persuade into repentance this headstrong lover, and he could only stand before him feeble and oppressed with a sense of his own ignorance and childishness. All the stock, trite arguments which his religious belief supplied him seemed to fall away and to be of no more use than empty husks of rotten nuts before the urgency, the fervor, and the self-will of real life. This man and woman loved each other, and they cared for no other fact than this on earth or in heaven. He left the villa-grounds in silence, with only a gesture of farewell salutation.     CHAPTER II.   \"Poor innocent, he meant well!\" thought the steward, as he watched the dark, slender form of the priest pass away through the vines and mulberry-trees. The young man did not greatly venerate the Church himself, though he showed himself at mass and sent flowers for the feast-days because it was the custom to do so. He was like most young Italians who have had a smattering of education, very indifferent on such matters, and inclined to ridicule. He left them for women and old men. But there was something about his visitant which touched him,--a simplicity, an unworldliness, a sincerity, which moved his respect; and he knew in his secret heart that the parocco, as he called him, was right enough in everything that he had said.  Gesualdo himself went on his solitary way, his buckled shoes dragging wearily over the dusty grass of the wayside. He had done no good, and he did not see what good he could do. He felt helpless before the force and speed of an unknown and guilty passion, as he once felt before a forest fire which he had seen in the Marche. All his Church books gave him homilies enough on the sins of the flesh and the temptings of the devil; but none of these helped him before the facts of this lawless and godless love, which seemed to pass high above his head like a whirlwind. He went on slowly and dully along the edge of the river-bed: a sense of something which he had always missed, which he would miss eternally, was with him.  It was now quite night. Gesualdo liked to walk late at night. All things were so peaceful, or at the least seemed so. You did not see the gashes in the lopped trees, the scars in the burned hill-side, the wounds in the mule's loins, the blood-shot eyes of the working ox, the goitred throat of the child rolling in the dust. Night, kindly friend of dreams, cast her soft veil over all woes, and made the very dust seem as a silvered highway to a throne for God.  He went now through the balmy air, the rustling canes, the low-hanging boughs of the fruit-laden peach-trees, and the sheaves of cut corn leaning one up against another under the hives. He followed the course of the water, a shallow thread at this season, glistening under the moon in its bed of shingle and sand. He passed the mill-house perforce on his homeward way, he saw the place of the weir made visible even in the dark by the lanterns which swung on a cord stretched from one bank to another, to entice any such fish as there might still be in the shallows. The mill stood down into the water, a strong place, built in olden days; the great black wheels were perforce at rest; the mules champed and chafed in their stalls, inactive, like the mill; for the next three months there would be nothing to do unless a storm came and brought a freshet from the hills. The miller would have the more leisure to nurse his wrongs, thought Gesualdo; and his heart was troubled: he had never met with these woes of the passions; they oppressed and alarmed him.  As he passed the low mill windows, protected from thieves by their iron gratings, he could see the interior, lighted as it was by the flame of oil lamps, and through the open lattices the voices, raised high in stormy quarrel, seemed to smite the holy stillness of the night like a blow. The figure of Generosa stood out against the light which shone behind her; she was in a paroxysm of rage; her eyes flashed like the lightnings of the hills, and her beautiful arms were tossed above her head in impassioned imprecation. Tasso Tassilo seemed for the moment to crouch beneath this rain of flame-like words; his face, on which the light shone full, was deformed with malignant and impotent fury, with covetous and jealous desire: there was no need to hear her words to know that she was taunting him with her love for Falko Melegari. Gesualdo was a weak man and physically timid; but here he hesitated but one instant. He lifted the latch of the house door and walked straightway into the mill kitchen.  \"In the name of Christ, be silent!\" he said to them, and made the sign of the cross.  The torrent of words stopped on the lips of the young woman; the miller scowled, and shrank from the light, and was mute.  \"Is this how you keep your vows to heaven and to each other?\" said Gesualdo.  A flush of shame came over the face of the woman; the man drew his hat farther over his eyes and went out of the kitchen silently. The victory had been easier than their monitor had expected. And yet of what use was it? he thought; they were silent out of respect for him. As soon as the restraint of his presence should be removed they would begin afresh. Unless he could change their souls, it was of little avail to bridle their lips for an hour.  There was a wild chafing hatred on one side and a tyrannical, covetous, dissatisfied love on the other: out of such discordant elements what peace could come?  Gesualdo shut the wooden shutters of the windows, that others should not see, as he had seen, into the interior; then he strove to pacify his old playmate, whose heaving breast, and burning cheeks, and eyes which scorched up in fire their own tears, spoke of a tempest lulled, not spent. He spoke with all the wisdom with which study and the counsels of the Fathers had supplied him, and with what was sweeter and more likely to be efficacious, a true and yearning wish to save her from herself. She was altogether wrong, and he strove to make her see the danger and the error of her ways. But he strove in vain. She had one of those temperaments, reckless, vehement, pleasure-loving, ardent, and profoundly selfish, which see only their own immediate gain, their own immediate desires. When he tried to stir her conscience by speaking of the danger she drew down on the head of the man she professed to love, she almost laughed.  \"He would be a poor creature,\" she said, proudly, \"if all danger would not be dear to him for me!\"  Gesualdo looked her full in the eyes.  \"You know that this matter must end in the death of one man or of the other. Do you mean that this troubles you not one whit?\"  \"It will not be my fault,\" said Generosa; and he saw in her the woman's lust of vanity, which finds food for its pride in the blood shed for her, as the tigress does, and even the gentle hind.  He remained an hour or more with her, exhausting every argument which his creed and his sympathy could suggest to him as having any possible force in it to sway this wayward and sin-bound soul; but he knew that his words were poured on her ear as uselessly as water on a stone floor. She was in a manner grateful to him as her friend, in a manner afraid of that vague majesty of some unknown power which he represented to her; but she hated her husband, she adored her lover: he could not stir her from those two extremes of passion. He left her with apprehension and a pained sense of his own impotence. She promised him that she would provoke Tassilo no more that night, and this poor promise was all that he could wring from her. It was late when he left the mill-house. He feared Candida would be alarmed at his unusual absence, and hastened, with trouble on his soul, towards the village, lying white and lonely underneath the midsummer moon. He had so little influence, so slender a power to persuade or warn, to counsel or command; he felt afraid that he was unworthy of his calling.  \"I should have been better in the cloister,\" he thought, sadly: \"I have not the key to human hearts.\"  He went on through a starry world of fire-flies making luminous the still-uncut corn, and, entering his presbytery, crept noiselessly up the stairs to his chamber, thankful that the voice of his housekeeper did not cry to him out of the darkness to know why he had so long tarried. He slept little that night, and was up, as was his wont, by daybreak. It was still dark when the church-bell was clanging above his head for the first office.  It was the day of St. Peter and of St. Paul. Few people came to the early mass,--some peasants who wanted to have the rest of the day clear, some women, thrifty housewives who were up betimes, Candida herself; no others. The lovely morning light streamed in, cool and roseate; there were a few lilies and roses on the altar; some red draperies floated in the door-way; the nightingales in the wild-rose hedge sang all the while, their sweet voices crossing the monotonous Latin recitatives. The mass was just over when into the church from without there arose a strange sound, shrill and yet hoarse, inarticulate and yet uproarious: it came from the throats of many people, all screaming and shouting and talking and swearing together. The peasants and the women who were on their knees scrambled to their feet and rushed to the door, thinking the earth had opened and the houses were falling. Gesualdo came down from the altar and strove to calm them, but they did not heed him, and he followed them despite himself. The whole village seemed out,--man, woman, and child: the nightingales grew dumb under the outcry.  \"What is it?\" asked Gesualdo.  Several voices shouted back to him, \"Tasso Tassilo has been murdered!\"  \"Ah!\"  Gesualdo gave a low cry, and leaned against the stem of a cypress-tree to save himself from falling. What use had been his words that night!  The murdered man had been found lying under the canes on the wayside not a rood from the church. A dog smelling at it had caused the body to be sought out and discovered. He had been dead but a few hours,--apparently killed by a knife thrust under his left shoulder, which had struck straight through the heart.  The agitation in the people was unimaginable, the uproar deafening. Some one with a grain of sense remaining had sent for the carabineers, but their picket was two miles off, and they had not yet arrived. The dead man still lay where he had fallen: every one was afraid to touch him.  \"Does his wife know?\" said Gesualdo, in a strange, hoarse voice.  \"His wife will not grieve,\" said a man in the crowd, and there was a laugh, subdued by awe and the presence of death and of the priest.  Gesualdo, with a strong shudder of disgust, held up his hand in horror and reproof, then bent over the dead body where it lay among the reeds.  \"Bring him to the sacristy,\" he said to the men nearest him. \"He must not lie there, like a beast unclean, by the roadside. Go fetch a hurdle,--a sheet,--anything.\"  But no one of them would stir.  \"If we touch him they will take us up for murdering him,\" they muttered, as one man.  \"Cowards! Stand off: I will carry him in-doors,\" said the priest.  \"You are in full canonicals!\" cried Candida, twitching at his sleeve.  But Gesualdo did not heed her. He was brushing off with a tender hand the flies which had begun to buzz about the dead man's mouth. The flies might have stung and eaten him all the day through for what any one of the little crowd would have cared: they would not have stretched a hand even to drag him into the shade.  Gesualdo was a weakly man; he had always fasted long and often, and had never been strong from his birth; but indignation, compassion, and horror for the moment lent him a strength not his own: he stooped down and raised the dead body in his arms, and, staggering under his burden, he bore it the few roods which separated the place where it had fallen from the church and the vicar's house.  The people looked on open-mouthed with wonder and awe. \"It is against the law,\" they muttered, but they did not offer active opposition. Gesualdo, unmolested save for the cries of the old housekeeper, carried his load into his own house and laid it reverently down on the couch which stood in the sacristy. He was exhausted with the great strain and effort; his limbs shook under him, the sweat poured off his face, the white silk and golden embroideries of his cope and stole were stained with the clotted blood which had fallen from the wound in the dead man's breast. He did not heed it, nor did he hear the cries of Candida mourning the disfigured vestments, nor the loud chattering of the crowd thrusting itself into the sacristy. He stood looking down on the poor, dusty, stiffening corpse before him with blind eyes, and thinking, in silent terror, \"Is it her work?\"  In his own soul he had no doubt.  Candida plucked once more at his robes.  \"The vestments! the vestments! You will ruin them! Take them off----\"  He put her from him with a gesture of dignity which she had never seen in him, and motioned the throng back towards the open door.  \"I will watch with him till the guards come,\" he said. \"Go send his wife hither.\"  Then he scattered holy water on the dead body, and kneeled down beside it and prayed.  The crowd thought that he acted strangely. Why was he so still and cold, and why did he seem so stunned and stricken? If he had screamed and raved, and run hither and thither purposelessly, and let the corpse lie where it was in the canes, he would have acted naturally in their estimation. They hung about the door-ways half afraid, half angered: some of them went to the mill-house, eager to have the honor of being the first bearer of such news.  No one was sorry for the dead man, except some few who were in his debt and knew that now they would be obliged to pay with heavy interest what they owed up to his successors.  With the grim pathos and dignity which death imparts to the commonest creature, the murdered man lay on the bench of the sacristy, amidst the hubbub and the uproar of the crowding people, he and the priest the only mute creatures in the place.  Gesualdo kneeled by the dead man in his blood-stained, sand-stained canonicals; he was praying with all the soul there was in him, not for the dead man, but for the living woman.  The morning broadened into the warmth of day. He rose from his knees, and bade his sacristan bring linen, and spread it over the corpse to cheat the flies and the gnats of their ghastly repast. No men of law came. The messengers returned. The picket-house had been closed at dawn, and the carabineers were away. There was nothing to be done but to wait. The villagers stood or sat about in the paved court, and in the road under the cypresses. They seldom had such an event as this in the dulness of their lives. They brought hunches of bread and ate as they discoursed of it.  \"Will you not break your fast?\" said Candida to Gesualdo. \"You will not bring him to life by starving yourself.\"  Gesualdo made a sign of refusal.  His mouth was parched, his throat felt closed; he was straining his eyes for the first sight of Generosa on the white road. If she were guilty she would never come, he thought, to look on the dead man.  Soon he saw her, coming with swift feet and flying skirts and bare head, through the boles of the cypresses. She was livid; her unbound hair was streaming behind her.  She had passed a feverish night, locking her door against her husband, and spending the whole weary hours at the casement where she could see the old gray villa where her lover dwelt, standing out against the moonlight among its ilex- and olive-trees. She had had no sense of the beauty of the night: she had been only concerned by the fret and fever of a first love and of a guilty passion.  She was not callous at heart, though wholly untrained and undisciplined in character, and her conscience told her that she gave a bad return to a man who had honestly and generously adored her, who had been lavish to her poverty out of his riches, and had never been unkind until a natural and justified jealousy had embittered the whole current of his life. She held the offence of infidelity lightly, yet her candor compelled her to feel that she was returning evil for good, and repaying in a base manner an old man's unwise but generous affection. She would have hesitated at nothing that could have united her life to her lover; yet in a corner of her soul she was vaguely conscious that there was a degree of unfairness and baseness in setting their youth and their ardor to hoodwink and betray a feeble and aged creature like Tasso Tassilo. She hated him fiercely: he was her jailer, her tyrant, her keeper. She detested the sound of his slow step, of his croaking voice, of his harsh calls to his men and his horses and mules; the sight of his withered features, flushed and hot with restless jealous pains, was at once absurd and loathsome to her. Youth has no pity for such woes of age, and she often mocked him openly and cruelly to his face. Still, she knew that she did him wrong, and her conscience had been more stirred by the reproof of Gesualdo than she had acknowledged. She was in that wavering mood when a woman may be saved from an unwise course by change, travel, movement, and the distractions of the world; but there were none of these for the miller's young wife. So long as her husband lived, so long would she be doomed to live here, with the roar of the mill-wheels and the foaming of the weir-water on her ear, and before her eyes the same thickets of cane, the same fields with their maples and vines, the same white, dusty road winding away beyond the poplars, and with nothing to distract her thoughts or lull her mind away from its idolatry of her fair-haired lover at the old gray palace on the hill above her home.  She had spent the whole night gazing at the place where he lived. He was not even there at that moment: he had gone away for two days to a grain-fair in the town of Vendramin, but she recalled with ecstasy their meetings by the side of the low green river, their hours in the wild flowering gardens of the palace, the lovely evenings when she had stolen out to see him come through the maize and canes, the fire-flies all alight about his footsteps. Sleepless but languid, weary and yet restless, she had thrown herself on her bed without taking off her clothes, and in the dark, as the bells for the first mass had rung over the shadowy fields. She had for the first time fallen into a heavy sleep, haunted by dreams of her lover, which made her stretch her arms to him in the empty air, and murmur, sleeping, wild and tender words.  She had been still on her bed, when the men of the mill had roused her, beating at the chamber door and crying to her,--  \"Generosa, Generosa, Padrona! get up! The master is murdered, and lying dead at the church!\"  She had been lying dreaming of Falko, and feeling in memory his kisses on her mouth, when those screams had come through the stillness of the early daybreak, through the music of the blackbirds piping in the cherry-boughs outside her windows.  She had sprung from off her bed.  She had huddled on some decenter clothing, and, bursting through the detaining hands of the henchmen and neighbors, had fled, as fast as her trembling limbs could bear her, to the church.  \"Is it true? Is it true?\" she cried, with white lips, to Gesualdo.  He looked at her with a long, inquiring regard: then, without a word, he drew the linen off the dead face of her husband, and pointed to it.  She, strong as a colt and full of life as a young tree, fell headlong on the stone floor in a dead swoon.  The people gathered about the door-way and watched her suspiciously and without compassion. There was no one there who did not believe her to be the murderess. No one except Gesualdo. In that one moment when he had looked into her eyes he had felt that she was guiltless. He called Candida to her and left her, and closed the door on the curious, cruel, staring eyes of the throng without.  The people murmured: what title had he more than they to command and direct in this matter? The murder was a precious feast to them: why should he defraud them of their rights?  \"He knows she is guilty,\" they muttered, \"and he wants to screen her and give her time to recover herself and to arrange what story she shall tell.\"  Soon there came the sound of horses' feet on the road, and the jingling of chains and scabbards stirred the morning air: the carabineers had arrived. Then came also the syndic and petty officers of the larger village of Sant' Arturo, where the communal municipality in which Marca was enrolled had its seat of justice, its tax-offices, and its schools. There was a great noise and stir, grinding of wheels and shouting of orders, vast clouds of dust and ceaseless din of voices, loud bickerings of conflicting authorities at war with one another, and rabid inquisitiveness and greedy excitement on all sides.  In a later time they remembered against him all this which he did now.  The feast of St. Peter and St. Paul had been a day of disaster and disorder, but to the good people of Marca both these were sweet. They had something to talk of from dawn till dark, and the blacker the tragedy the merrier wagged the tongues. The soul of their vicar alone was sick within him. Since he had seen the astonished, horrified eyes of the woman Generosa he had never once doubted her, but he felt that her guilt must seem clear as the noonday to all others. Her disputes with her husband and her passion for Falko Melegari were facts known to all the village, and who else had any interest in his death? The whole of Marca pronounced as with one voice against her: the women had always hated her for her superior beauty, and the men had always borne her a grudge for her saucy disdain of them, and that way of bearing herself as though a beggar from Bocca d'Arno were a queen.  \"Neighbors put up with her pride while she was on the sunny side of the street,\" said Candida, with grim satisfaction, \"but now she is in the shade they'll fling the stones fast enough.\" And she was ready to fling her own stone. Generosa had always seemed an impudent jade to her, coming and talking with Don Gesualdo, as she did, at all hours, and as though the church and the sacristy were open bazaars!  How that day passed, and how he bore himself through all its functions, he never knew. It was the dead of night, when he, still dressed, and unable even to think calmly, clasping his crucifix in his hands, and pacing to and fro his narrow chamber with restless and uneven steps, heard his name called by the voice of a man in great agitation, and, looking out of his casement, saw Falko Melegari on his gray horse, which was covered with foam and sweating as from a hard gallop.  \"Is it true?\" he cried, a score of times.  \"Yes, it is all true,\" said Gesualdo. His voice was stern and cold: he could not tell what share this man might not have had in the crime.  \"But she is innocent as that bird in the air,\" screamed her lover, pointing to a scops owl which was sailing above the cypresses.  Gesualdo bowed his head and spread out his hands, palm downward, in a gesture which meant hopeless doubt.  \"I went away at dark into the town to buy cattle,\" said the steward, with sobs in his throat. \"I rode out by the opposite road. I knew naught of it. Oh, my God, why was I not here? They should not have taken her without its costing them hard.\"  \"You would have done her no good,\" said Gesualdo, coldly. \"You have done her harm enough already,\" he added, after a pause. Falko did not resent the words: the tears were falling like rain down his cheeks, his hands were clinched on his saddle-bow, the horse stretched its foam-flecked neck unheeded.  \"Who did it? Who could do it? He had many enemies. He was a hard man,\" he muttered.  Gesualdo gave a gesture of hopeless doubt and ignorance. He looked down on the lover's handsome face and head in the moonlight. There was a strange expression in his own eyes.  \"Curse you for a cold-hearted priest,\" thought the young steward, with bitterness. Then he wheeled his horse sharply round, and, without any other word, rode off towards his home in the glistening white light, to stable his weary horse, and to saddle another to ride into the larger village of Sant' Arturo. It was past midnight; he could do no good; he could see no one; but it was a relief to him to be in movement; he felt that it would choke him to sit and sup and sleep and smoke as usual in his quiet house among the magnolias and the myrtles, whilst the love of his life lay alone in her misery.  All gladness which would at any natural death of Tasso Tassilo's have filled his soul was quenched in the darkness of horror in which her fate was snatched from him and plunged into the mystery and the blackness of imputed crime.  He never actually suspected her for a moment; but he knew that others would no doubt do more than suspect.  \"Perhaps the brute killed himself,\" he thought, \"that the blame of the crime might lie on her and part her from me.\"  Then he knew that such a thought was absurd. Tasso Tassilo had loved his life, loved his mill, and his money, and his petty power, and his possession of his beautiful wife; and, besides, what man could stab himself from behind between the shoulders? It was just the blow that a strong yet timid woman would give. As he walked to and fro on the old terrace whilst they saddled the horse, he felt a sickening shudder run through him. He did not suspect her. No, not for an instant. And yet there was a dim, unutterable horror upon him which veiled the remembered beauty of her face.  The passing of the days which came after this feast of the two apostles was full of an unspeakable horror to him, and in the brief space of them he grew haggard, hollow-cheeked, almost aged, despite his youth. The dread formalities and tyrannies of the law seized on the quiet village and tortured every soul in it: every one who had seen or heard or known aught of the dead man was questioned, tormented, harangued, examined, suspected. Don Gesualdo himself was made subject to a searching and oft-repeated interrogation, and severely reproved that he had not let the body lie untouched until the arrival of the officers of justice. He told the exact truth as far as he knew it, but when questioned as to the relations of the murdered man and his wife he hesitated, prevaricated, contradicted himself, and gave the impression to the judicial authorities that he knew much more against the wife than he would say. What he tried to do was to convey to others his own passionate conviction of the innocence of Generosa; but he utterly failed in doing this; and his very anxiety to defend her only created an additional suspicion against her.  The issue of the preliminary investigation was that the wife of Tasso Tassilo, murdered on the morning of the day of St. Peter and St. Paul, was consigned to prison, to be \"detained as a precaution\" under the lock and key of the law, circumstantial evidence being held to be strongly against her as the primary cause, if not the actual executant, of the murder of her lord.  Every one called from the village to speak of her spoke against her, with the exception of Falko Melegari, who was known to be her lover, and whose testimony weighed not a straw, and Don Gesualdo himself, a priest, indeed, but the examining judge was no friend of priests, and would not have believed them on their oaths, whilst the strong friendship for her, and the nervous anxiety to shield her, displayed so unwisely though so sincerely by him, did her more harm than good, and made his bias so visible that his declarations were held valueless.  \"You know I am innocent!\" she cried to him, the day of her arrest; and he answered her, with the tears falling down his cheeks, \"I am sure of it! I would die to prove it! For one moment I did doubt you,--pardon me!--but only one. I am sure you are innocent, as I am sure that the sun hangs in the skies.\"  But his unsupported belief availed nothing to secure that of others: the dominant feeling among the people of Marca was against her, and, in face of that feeling and of the known jealousy of her which had consumed the latter days of the dead man, the authorities deemed that they could do no less than order her provisional arrest. Her very beauty was a weapon turned against her. It seemed so natural to her accusers that so lovely and so young a woman should have desired to rid herself of a husband, old, ill-favored, exacting, and unloved. In vain--utterly in vain--did Falko Melegari, black with rage and beside himself with misery, swear by every saint in the calendar that his relations with her had been hitherto absolutely innocent. No one believed him.  \"You are obliged to say that,\" said the judge, with good-humored impatience.  \"But, God in heaven, why not when it is true?\" shouted Falko.  \"It is always true when the _damo_ is a man of honor?\" said the ironical judge, with an incredulous, amused smile.  So, her only defenders utterly discredited, she paid the penalty of being handsomer and grander than her neighbors, and was taken to the town of Vendramin, and there left to lie in prison until such time as the majesty of the law should be pleased to decide whether or not it deemed her guilty of causing the death of her husband. The people of Marca were content. They only could not see why the law should take such a time to doubt and puzzle over a fact which to them all was as clear as the weather-vane on their church tower.  \"Who should have killed him, if not she or her _damo_?\" they asked, and no one could answer.  So she was taken away by the men of justice, and Marca no more saw her handsome head with the silver pins in its coiled hair leaning out from the square mill windows, or her bright-colored skirts going light as the wind up the brown sides of the hills, and through the yellow-blossomed gorse in the warm autumn air, to some trysting-place under the topmost pines, where the wild pigeons dwelt in the boughs above, and the black stoat ran through the bracken below.  The work of the mill went on the same, being directed by the brother of Tassilo, who had always had a share in it, both of labor and profit. The murder still served for food for people's tongues through vintage and onward until the maize-harvest and the olive-gathering. As the nights grew long and the days cold, it ceased to be the supreme theme of interest in Marca: no one ever dreamed that there could be a doubt of the absent woman's guilt, or said a good word for her; and no one gave her any pity for wasting her youth and fretting her soul out in a prison-cell, though they were disposed to grant that what she had done had been, after all, perhaps only natural, considering all things. Her own family were too poor to travel to her help,--indeed, only heard of her misfortunes after many days, and then only by chance, through a travelling hawker: they could do nothing for her, and did not try; she had never sent them as much of her husband's money as they had expected her to do, and now that she was in trouble she might get out of it as she could, so they said. She had always cared for her ear-rings and breastpins, never for them: she would see if her jewels would help her now. When any member of a poor family marries into riches, the desire to profit by her marriage is, if ungratified, quickly turned into hatred of herself. Why should she have gone to eat stewed kid and fried lamb and hare baked with fennel, when they had only a bit of salt fish and an onion now and then?  They had admitted the vicar of San Bartolo, once or twice, to visit her, the jailer standing by, but he had been unable to do more than to weep with her and assure her of his own perfect belief in her innocence. The change he found in her shocked him so greatly that he could scarcely speak; and he thought to himself, as he saw how aged and wasted and altered she was, if she lose her beauty and grow old before her time, what avail will it be to her even if they declare her innocent? Her gay lover will look at her no more.  Falko Melegari loved her wildly, ardently, vehemently indeed; but Gesualdo, with that acute penetration which sometimes supplies in delicate natures that knowledge of the world which they lack, felt that it was not a love which had any qualities in it to withstand the trials of time or the loss of physical charms. Perchance Generosa herself felt as much; and the cruel consciousness of it hurt her more than her prison-bars.     CHAPTER III.   The winter passed away, and with February the corn spread a green carpet everywhere, the almond-trees blossomed on the hill-sides, the violets opened the way for the wind-flowers, and the willows budded beside the water-mill. There were braying of bugles, twanging of lutes, cracking of shots, drinking of wines on the farms and in the village as a rustic celebration of Carnival. Not much of it, for times are hard and men's hearts heavy in these days, and the sunlit grace and airy gayety natural to it are things forever dead in Italy, like the ilex forests and the great gardens that have perished for ever and aye.  Lent came, with its church-bells sounding in melancholy iteration over the March fields, where the daffodils were blowing by millions, and the parocco of San Bartolo fasted and prayed and mortified his flesh in every way that his creed allowed, and hoped by such miseries, pains, and penances to attain grace in heaven, if not on earth, for Generosa in her misery. All through Lent he wearied the ear of God with incessant supplication for her.  Day and night he racked his brain to discover any evidence as to who the assassin had been. He never once doubted her: if the very apostles and saints of his Church had all descended on earth to witness against her, he would have cried to them that she was innocent.  The sickening suspicions, the haunting, irrepressible doubts, which now and then came over the mind of her lover as he walked to and fro by the edge of the river at night, looking up at what had been the casement of her chamber, did not assail for an instant the stronger faith of Gesualdo, weak as he was in body and, in some ways, weak in character.  The truth might remain in horrid mystery, in impenetrable darkness, forever; it would make no difference to him; he would be always convinced that she had been innocent. Had he not known her when she was a little, barefooted child, coming flying through the shallow green pools and the great yellow grasses and the sunny canebrakes of the Bocca d'Arno?  Most innocent, indeed, had been his relations with the wife of Tassilo, but to him it seemed that the interest he had taken in her, the pleasure he had felt in converse with her, had been criminal. There had been times when his eyes, which should have only seen in her a soul to save, had become aware of her mere bodily beauty, had dwelt on her with an awakening of carnal admiration. It sufficed to make him guilty in his own sight. This agony which he felt for her was the sympathy of a personal affection. He knew it, and his consciousness of it flung him at the feet of his crucifix in tortures of conscience.  He knew, too, that he had done her harm by the incoherence and the reticence of his testimony, by the mere vehemence with which he had unwisely striven to affirm an innocence which he had no power to prove,--even by that natural impulse of humanity which had moved him to bring her husband's corpse under the roof of the church and close the door upon the clamorous and staring throng who saw in the tragedy but a pastime. He, more than any other, had helped to cast on her the darkness of suspicion; he, more than any other, had helped to make earthly peace and happiness forever denied to her.  Even if they acquitted her in the house of law yonder, she would be dishonored for life. Even her lover, who loved her with all the hot coarse ardor of a young man's uncontrolled desires, had declared that he would be ashamed to walk beside her in broad day so long as this slur of possible, if unproved, crime were on her. His sensitive soul began to take alarm lest it were not a kind of sin to be so occupied with the fate of one to the neglect and detriment of others. Candida saw him growing thinner and more shadow-like every day, with ever-increasing anxiety. To fast, she knew, was needful above all for a priest in Lent, but he did not touch what he might lawfully have eaten: the new-laid eggs and the crisp lettuces of her providing failed to tempt him; and no mortal man, she told him, could live on air and water as he did.  \"There should be reason in all piety,\" she said to him, and he assented.  But he did not change his ways, which were rather those of a monk of the Thebaid than of a vicar of a parish. He had the soul in him of a St. Anthony, of a St. Francis, and he had been born too late; the world as it is was too coarse and too incredulous for him, even in a little rustic primitive village hidden away from the eyes of men under its millet and its fig-trees.  The people of Marca noticed the change in him. Pale he had always been, but now he was the color of his own ivory Christ; taciturn, too, he had always been, yet he had ever had playful words for the children, kind words for the aged; these were silent now. The listless and mechanical manner with which he went through the offices of the Church contrasted with the passionate and despairing cries which seemed to come from his very soul when he preached, and which vaguely frightened a rural congregation who were wholly unable to understand them.  \"One would think the good parocco had some awful sin on his soul,\" said a woman to Candida one evening.  \"Nay, nay; he is as pure as a lamb,\" said Candida, twirling her distaff. \"But he was always helpless and childlike, and too much taken up with heavenly things--may the saints forgive me for saying so! He should be in a monastery along with St. Romolo and St. Francis.\"  But yet the housekeeper, though loyalty itself, was, in her own secret thoughts, not a little troubled at the change she saw in her master. She put it down to the score of his agitation at the peril of Generosa F; but this in itself seemed to her unfitting in one of his sacred calling. A mere light-o'-love and saucebox, as she had always herself called the miller's wife, was wholly unworthy to occupy, even in pity, the thoughts of so holy a man.  There could not be a doubt that she had given that knife-stroke among the canes in the dusk of the dawn of St. Peter and St. Paul, thought Candida, among whose virtues charity had small place; but what had the parocco to do with it?  In her rough way, motherly and unmannerly, she ventured to take her master to task for so much interest in a sinner.  \"The people of Marca say you think too much about that foul business; they even whisper that you neglect your holy duties,\" she said to him, as she served the frugal supper of cabbage soaked in oil. \"There will always be crimes as long as the world wags on, but that is no reason why good souls should put themselves out about that which they cannot help.\"  Gesualdo said nothing, but she saw the nerves of his mouth quiver.  \"I have no business to lecture your reverence on your duties,\" she added, tartly; \"but they do say that so much anxiety for a guilty woman is a manner of injustice to innocent souls.\"  Gesualdo struck his closed hand on the table with concentrated expression of passion.  \"How dare you say that she is guilty?\" he cried. \"Who has proved her so?\"  Candida looked at him with shrewd suspicious eyes as she set down the bottle of vinegar.  \"I have met with nobody who doubts it,\" she said, cruelly, \"except your reverence, and her lover up yonder at the villa.\"  \"You are all far too ready to believe evil,\" said Gesualdo, with nervous haste; and he arose and pushed aside the untasted dish and went out of the house.  \"He is beside himself for that jade's sake,\" thought Candida, and, after waiting a little while to see if he returned, she sat down and ate the cabbage.  Whether there were as many crimes in the world as flies on the pavement in summer, she saw no reason why that good food should be wasted.  After her supper, she took her distaff and went and sat on the low wall which divided the church ground from the road, and gossiped with any one of the villagers who chanced to come by. No one was ever too much occupied not to have leisure to talk in Marca, and the church wall was a favorite gathering-place for the sunburnt women with faces like leather under their broad summer hats or their woollen winter kerchiefs, who came and went to and from the fields or the well or the washing-reservoir, with its broad stone tanks brimming with brown water under a vine-covered pergola, where the hapless linen was wont to be beaten and banged as though it were so many sheets of cast-iron. And here with her gossips and friends Candida could not help letting fall little words--stray sentences--which revealed the trouble her mind was in as to the change in her master. She was devoted to him, but her devotion was not so strong as her love of mystery and her impatience of anything which opposed a barrier to her curiosity. She was not conscious that she said a syllable which could have affected his reputation, yet her neighbors all went away from her with the idea that there was something wrong in the presbytery, and that if she had chosen, the priest's housekeeper could have told some very strange tales.  Since the days of the miller's murder, a vague feeling against Don Gesualdo had been growing up in Marca. A man who does not cackle and scream and roar till he is hoarse at the slightest thing which happens is always unnatural and suspicious in the eyes of an Italian community. The people of Marca began to remember that he had some foreign blood in him, and that he had always been more friendly with the wife of Tasso Tassilo than was meet in one of his calling.  Falko Melegari had been denied admittance to her by the authorities. They were not sure that he, as her lover, had not some complicity in the crime committed; and, moreover, his impetuous and inconsiderate language to the judge of instruction at the preliminary investigation had been so fierce and so unwise that it had prejudiced against him all the officers of the law. This exclusion of him heightened the misery he felt, and moved him also to a querulous impatience with the vicar of San Bartolo for being allowed to see her.  \"Those black snakes slip and slide in anywhere,\" he thought, savagely, and his contempt for and dislike of ecclesiastics, which the manner and character of Gesualdo had held in abeyance, revived in its pristine force.  In Easter-time Gesualdo was always greatly fatigued; and when Easter came round this year, and the sins of Marca were poured into his ear,--little, sordid, mean sins, of which the narration wearied and sickened him,--they seemed more loathsome to him than they had ever done. There was such likeness and such repetition in the confessions of all of them,--greed, avarice, dishonesty, fornication: the scale never varied, and the story told kept always at the same low level of petty and coarse things. Their confessor heard with a tired mind and a sick heart, and, as he gave them absolution, shuddered at the doubts of the infallibility of his Church which for the first time passed with dread terror through his thoughts. The whole world seems to him changing. He felt as though the solid earth itself were giving way beneath his feet. His large eyes had a startled and frightened look in them, and his face grew thinner every day.  It was after the last office in this Easter week, when a man came through the evening shadows towards the church. His name was Emilio Raffagiolo, but he was always known as the Girellone,--the rover. Such nicknames replace the baptismal names of the country-people till the latter are almost forgotten, whilst the family name is scarcely ever employed at all in rural communities. The Girellone was a carter, who had been in service at the water-mill for some few months. He was a man of thirty or thereabouts, with a dusky face and a shock head of hair, and hazel eyes, dull and yet cunning. He was dressed now in his festal attire, and he had a round hat set on one side of his head: he doffed it as he entered the church. He could not read or write, and his ideas of his creed were hazy and curious: the Church represented to him a thing with virtue in it, like a charm or a bunch of herbs; it was only necessary, he thought, to observe certain formul of it to be safe within it; conduct outside it was of no consequence. Nothing on earth can equal in confusion and indistinctness the views of the Italian rustic as regards his religion. The priest is to him as the medicine-man to the savage; but he has ceased to respect his counsels, whilst retaining a superstitious feeling about his office. This man, doffing his hat, entered the church and approached the confessional, crossing himself as he did so. Gesualdo, with a sigh, prepared to receive his confession, although the hour was unusual, and the many services of the day had fatigued him until his head swam and his vision was clouded. But at no time had he ever availed himself of any excuse of time or physical weakness to avoid the duties of his office. Recognizing the carter, he wearily awaited the usual tale of low vice and petty sins, some drunkenness, or theft, or lust gratified in some unholy way, and resigned himself wearily to follow the confused repetitions with which the rustic of every country answers questions or narrates circumstances. His conscience smote him for his apathy. Ought not the soul of this clumsy, wine-sodden boor to be as dear to him as that of lovelier creatures?  The man answered the usual priestly interrogations sullenly and at random; he could not help doing what he did, because superstition drove him to it and was stronger for the time than any other thing; but he was angered at his own conscience and afraid of what he did: his limbs trembled, and his tongue seemed to him to swell and grow larger than his mouth, and refused to move, as he said at length, in a thick, choked voice,--  \"It was I that killed him!\"  \"Whom?\" asked Gesualdo, whilst his own heart stood still. Without hearing the answer, he knew what it would be.  \"Tasso, the miller,--my master,\" said the carter; and, having confessed thus far, he recovered confidence and courage, and, in the rude, involved, garrulous utterances common to his kind, he leaned his mouth closer to Gesualdo's ear, and told, with a curious sort of pride in the accomplishment of it, why and how it had been done.  \"I wanted to go to South America,\" he muttered. \"I have a cousin there, and he says one makes money fast and works little. I had often wished to take Tassilo's money, but I was always afraid. He locked it up as soon as he took any, were it ever so little, and it never saw light again till it went to the bank or was paid away for her finery. He wasted many a good fifty-franc note on her back.  \"Look you, the night before the feast of Peter and Paul, he had received seven hundred francs in the day for wheat, and I saw him lock it up in his bureau and say to his wife that he should take it to the town next day. That was in the forenoon. At eventide they had a worse quarrel than usual. She taunted him, and he threatened her. In the dawn I was listening to hear him astir. He was up before dawn, and he unbarred and opened the mill-house himself, and called to the foreman, and said he was going to town, and told us what we were to do. 'I shall be away all day,' he said. It was still dusky. I stole out after him without the men seeing. I said to myself I would take this money from him as he went along the crossroads to take the diligence at Sant' Arturo. I did not say to myself I would kill him, but I resolved to get the money. It was enough to take one out to America and keep one awhile when one got out there. So I made up my mind. Money is at the bottom of most things. I followed him half a mile before I could get my courage up. He did not see me because of the canes. He was crossing that grass where the trees are so thick, when I said to myself, 'Now or never!' Then I sprang on him and stabbed him under the shoulder. He fell like a stone. I searched him, but there was nothing in his pockets except a revolver loaded. I think he had only made a feint of going to the town, thinking to come back and find the lovers together. I buried the knife under a poplar a few yards off where he fell. I could have thrown it in the river, but they say things which have killed people always float. You will find it if you dig for it under the big poplar-tree that they call the Grand Duke's, because they say Pietro Leopoldo sat under it once on a time. There was a little blood on the blade, but there was none anywhere else, for he bled inwardly. They do if you strike right. I was a butcher's lad once, and I used to kill the oxen, and I know. That is all.  \"When I found the old rogue had no money with him I could have killed him a score of times over. I cannot think how it was that he left home without it, unless it was, as I say, that he meant to go back unknown and unawares and surprise his wife with Melegari. That must have been it, I think. For, greedy as he was over his money, he was greedier still over his wife. I turned him over on his back, and left him lying there, and I went back to the mill and began my day's work, till the people came and wakened her and told the tale: then I left off work and came and looked on like the rest of them. That is all.\"  The man who made the confession was calm and unmoved; the priest who heard it was sick with horror, pale to the lips with agitation and anguish.  \"But his wife is accused! She may be condemned!\" he cried, in agony.  \"I know that,\" said the man, stolidly. \"But you cannot tell of me. I have told you under the seal of confession.\"  It was quite true: come what would, Gesualdo could never reveal what he had heard. His eyes swam, his head reeled, a deadly sickness came upon him; all his short life simple and harmless things had been around him; he had been told of the crimes of men, but he had never been touched by them; he had known of the sins of the world, but he had never realized them. The sense that the murderer of Tasso Tassilo was within a hand's breadth of him, that these eyes which stared at him, this voice which spoke to him, were those of the actual assassin, that it was possible and yet utterly impossible for him to help justice and save innocence,--all this overcame him with its overwhelming burden of horror and of divided duty. He lost all consciousness as he knelt there, and fell heavily forward on the wood-work of the confessional.  His teachers had said aright, in the days of his novitiate, that he would never be of stern enough stuff to deal with the realities of life.  When he recovered his senses, sight and sound and sensibility all returning to him slowly and with a strange, numb, pricking pain in his limbs and his body and his brain, the church was quite dark, and the man who had confessed his crime to him was gone.  Gesualdo gathered himself up with effort, and sat down on the wooden seat and tried to think. He was bitterly ashamed of his own weakness. What was he worth, he, shepherd and leader of men, if at the first word of horror which affrighted him he fainted as women faint, and failed to speak in answer the condemnation which should have been spoken? Was it for such cowardice as this that they had anointed him and received him as a servitor of the Church?  His first impulse was to go and relate his feebleness and failure to his bishop; the next moment he remembered that even so much support as this he must not seek: to no living being must he tell this wretched blood-secret.  The law which respects nothing would not respect the secrets of the confessional; but he knew that all the human law in the world could not alter his own bondage to the duty he had with his own will accepted.  It was past midnight when, with trembling limbs, he groped his way out of the porch of his church and found the entrance of the presbytery and climbed the stone stairs to his own chamber.  Candida opened her door, and thrust her head through the aperture, and cried to him,--  \"Where have you been mooning all this while, and the lamp burning to waste, and your good bed yawning for you? You are not a strong man enough to keep these hours, and for a priest they are not decent ones.\"  \"Peace, woman!\" said Gesualdo, in a tone which she had never heard from him. He went within and closed the door. He longed for the light of dawn, and yet he dreaded it.  When the dawn came it brought nothing to him except the knowledge that the real murderer was there, within a quarter of a mile of him, and yet could not be denounced by him to justice even to save the guiltless. The usual occupations of a week-day claimed his time, and he went through them all with mechanical precision, but he spoke all his words as in a dream, and the red sanded bricks of his house, the deal table, with the black coffee and the round loaf set out on it, the stone sink at which Candida was washing endive and cutting lettuces, the old men and women who came and went telling their troubles garrulously and begging for pence, the sunshine which streamed in over the threshold, the poultry which picked up the crumbs off the floor, all these homely and familiar things seemed unreal to him, and were seen as through a mist.  This little narrow dwelling with the black cypress shadows falling athwart it, which had once seemed to him the abode of perfect peace, now seemed to imprison him, till his heart failed and died within him.  In the dead of night, at the end of the week, moved by an unconquerable impulse which had haunted him the whole seven days, he rose, and lit a lantern and let himself out of his own door noiselessly, stealthily, as though he were on some guilty errand, and took the sexton's spade from the tool-house, and went across the black shadows which stretched over the grass, towards the place where the body of Tasso Tassilo had lain dead. In the moonlight there stood tall and straight a column of green leaves: it was the stately Lombardy poplar, which was spared by the hatchet, because Marca was, so far as it understood anything, loyal in its regret for the days that were gone. Many birds which had been for hours sound asleep in its boughs flew out with a great whirr of wings and with chirps of terror as the footfall of Gesualdo awakened and alarmed them. He set his lantern down on the ground, for the rays of the moon did not penetrate as far as the deep gloom the poplars threw around them, and began to dig. He dug some little time without success: then his spade struck against something which shone amidst the dry clay soil; it was the knife. He took it up with a shudder. There were dark red spots on the steel blade. It was a narrow, slightly-curved knife about six inches long, such a knife as every Italian of the lower classes carries every day, and with which most Italian murders are committed.  He looked at it long. If the inanimate thing could but have spoken, could but have told, the act which it had done!  He, kneeling on the ground, gazed at it with a sickening fascination; then he replaced it deeper down in the ground, and with his spade smoothed the earth with which he covered it. The soil was so dry that it did not show much trace of having been disturbed. Gravely he returned homeward, convinced now of the truth of the confession made to him. Some men met him on the road, country lads driving cattle early to a distant fair: they saluted him with respect, but laughed when they had passed him.  What had his reverence, they wondered, been doing with a spade at this time of night? Did he dig for treasure? There was a tradition in the country-side of sacks of ducats which had been buried by the river to save them from the French troops in the time of the invasion by the First Consul.  Gesualdo, unconscious of their comments, went home, put the spade back in the tool-house, unlocked his church, entered, and prayed long; then, waking his sleepy _capellano_, he bade him rise and set the bell ringing for the first mass. The man got up, grumbling because it was still quite dark, and next day talked to his neighbors about the queer ways of his vicar,--how he would walk all night about his room, sometimes get up and go out in the dead of night even. He complained that his own health and patience would soon give way. An uneasy feeling grew up in the village: some gossips even suggested that the bishop should be spoken to in the town; but every one was fearful of being the first to take such a step, and no one was sure how so great a person could be approached, and the matter remained in abeyance. But the disquietude and the antagonism which the manner and appearance of their priest had created grew with the growth of the year, and with it also the impression that he knew more of the miller's assassination than he would ever say.  A horrible sense of being this man's accomplice grew also upon himself: the bond of silence which he kept perforce with this wretch seemed to him to make him so. His slender strength and sensitive nerves ill fitted him to sustain so heavy a burden, so horrible a knowledge.  \"It has come to chastise me because I have thought of her too often, have been moved by her too warmly,\" he told himself; and his soul shrank within him at what appeared the greatness of his own guilt.  Since receiving the confession of the carter he did not dare to seek an interview with Generosa. He did not dare to look on her agonized eyes and feel that he knew what could set her free and yet must never tell it. He trembled lest in sight of the suffering of this woman, who possessed such power to move and weaken him, he should be untrue to his holy office, should let the secret he had to keep escape him. Like all timid and vacillating tempers, he sought refuge in procrastination.  All unconscious of the growth of public feeling against him, and wrapped in that absorption which comes from one dominant idea, he pursued the routine of his parochial life, and went through all the ceremonials of his office, hardly more conscious of what he did than the candles which his sacristan lighted. The confession made to him haunted him night and day. He saw it, as it were, written in letters of blood on the blank white walls of his bedchamber, of his sacristy, of his church itself. The murderer was there, at large, unknown to all,--at work like any other man in the clear, sweet sunshine, talking and laughing, eating and drinking, waking and sleeping, yet as unsuspected as a child unborn. And all the while Generosa was in prison. There was only one chance left; if she should be acquitted by her judges. But even then the slur and stain of an imputed, though unproved, crime would always rest upon her and make her future dark, her name a by-word in her birthplace. Yes, after what her lover had said, no mere acquittal, leaving doubt and suspicion behind it, would give her back to the light and joy of life. Every man's hand would be against her; every child would point at her as the woman who had been accused of the assassination of her husband.  One day he sought Falko Melegari when the latter was making up the accounts of his stewardship at an old bureau in a deep window-embrasure of the villa.  \"You know that the date of the trial is fixed for the 10th of next month?\" he said, in a low, stifled voice.  The young man, leaning back in his wooden chair, gave a sign of assent.  \"And you,\" said Gesualdo, with a curious expression in his eyes,--\"if they absolve her, will you have the courage to prove your own belief in her innocence? Will you marry her when she is set free?\"  The question was abrupt and unlooked for. Falko changed color: he hesitated.  \"You will not!\" said Gesualdo.  \"I have not said so,\" answered the young man, evasively. \"I do not know that she would exact it.\"  Exact it! Gesualdo did not know much of human nature, but he knew what the use of that cold word implied.  \"I thought you loved her! I mistook,\" he said, bitterly. A rosy flush came for a moment on the wax-like pallor of his face.  Falko Melegari looked at him insolently.  \"A churchman should not meddle with these things! Love her! I love her,--yes. It ruins my life to think of her yonder. I would cut off my right arm to save her; but to marry her if she come out absolved,--that is another thing; one's name a by-word, one's credulity laughed at, one's neighbors shy of one,--that is another thing, I say. It will not be enough for her judges to acquit her; that will not prove her innocence to all the people here, or to my people at home in my own country.\"  He rose and pushed his heavy chair away impatiently: he was ashamed of his own words, but in the most impetuous Italian natures prudence and self-love are always the strongest instincts. Gesualdo looked at him with a great scorn in the depths of his dark, deep, luminous eyes. This handsome and virile lover seemed to him a very poor creature, a coward and faithless.  \"In the depths of your soul you doubt her yourself!\" he said, with severity and contempt, as he turned away from the writing-table and went out through the windows into the garden beyond.  \"No, as God lives, I do not doubt her,\" cried Falko Melegari. \"Not for an hour, not for a moment. But to make others believe,--that is more difficult. I will maintain her and befriend her always if they set her free; but marry her,--take her to my people,--have every one say that my wife had been in jail on suspicion of murder,--that I could not do: no man would do it who had a reputation to lose. One loves for love's sake, but one marries for the world's.\"  He spoke to empty air: there was no one to hear him but the little green lizards who had slid out of their holes in the stone under the window-step. Gesualdo had gone across the rough grass of the garden, and had passed out of sight beyond the tall hedge of rose-laurel.  The young man resumed his writing, but he was restless and uneasy, and could not continue his calculations of debit and audit of loss and profit. He took his gun, whistled his dog, and went up towards the hills, where hares were to be found in the heather and snipes under the gorse. His temper was ruffled, and his mind in great irritation against his late companion: he felt angrily that he must have appeared a poltroon and a poor and unmanly lover in the eyes of the churchman. Yet he had only spoken, he felt sure, as any other man would have done in his place.  In the sympathy of their common affliction, his heart had warmed for a while to Gesualdo, as to the only one who like himself cared for the fate of Tasso Tassilo's wife; but now that suspicion had entered into him, there returned with it all his detestation of the Church and all the secular hatred which the gentle character of the priest of Marca had for a time lulled in him.  \"Of course he is a liar and a hypocrite,\" he thought savagely. \"Perhaps he is a murderer as well!\"  He knew that the idea was a kind of madness. Gesualdo had never been known to hurt a fly; indeed, his aversion even to see pain inflicted had made him often the laughing-stock of the children of Marca when he had rescued birds or locusts or frogs from their tormenting fingers, and forbidden them to throw stones at the lambs or kids they drove to pasture. \"They are not baptized,\" the children had often said, with a grin; and Gesualdo had as often answered, \"The good God baptized them himself.\"  It was utter madness to suppose that such a man, tender as a woman, timid as a sheep, gentle as a spaniel, could possibly have stabbed Tasso Tassilo to the death within a few roods of his own church, almost on holy ground itself. And yet the idea grew and grew in the mind of Generosa's lover until it acquired all the force of an actual conviction. We welcome no supposition so eagerly as one which accords with and intensifies our own prejudices. He neglected his duties and occupations to brood over this one suspicion and put together all the trifles which he could remember in confirmation of it. It haunted him wherever he was,--at wine-fair, at horse-market, at cattle-sale, in the corn-field, among the vines, surrounded by his peasantry at noonday, or alone in the wild deserted garden of the villa by moonlight.  In his pain and fury, it was a solace to him to turn his hatred on to some living creature. As he sat alone and thought over all which had passed (as he did think of it night and day always), many a trifle rose to his mind which seemed to him to confirm his wild and vague suspicions of the vicar of San Bartolo. Himself a free-thinker, it appeared natural to suspect any kind of crime in a member of the priesthood. The Italian sceptic is as narrow and as arrogant in his free-thought as the Italian believer in his bigotry. Melegari was a good-hearted young man, and kind and gay and generous by nature; but he had the prejudices of his time and of his school. These prejudices made him ready to believe that a priest was always fit food at heart for the galleys or the scaffold,--a mass of concealed iniquity covered by his cloth.  \"I believe you know more of it than any one,\" he said, roughly, one day when he passed the priest on a narrow field-path, while his eyes flashed suspiciously over the downcast face of Gesualdo, who shrank a little, as if he had received a blow, and was silent. He had spoken on an unconsidered impulse, and would have been unable to say what his own meaning really was; but, as he saw the embarrassment and observed the silence of his companion, what he had uttered at hazard seemed to him curiously confirmed and strengthened.  \"If you know anything which could save her and you do not speak,\" he said, passionately, \"may all the devils you believe in torture you through all eternity!\"  Gesualdo still kept silent. He made the sign of the cross nervously, and went on his way.  \"Curse all these priests!\" said the young man, bitterly, looking after him. \"If one could only deal with them as one does with other men!--but in their vileness and their feebleness they are covered by their frock like women.\"  He was beside himself with rage and misery and the chafing sense of his own impotence; he was young and strong and ardently enamoured, and yet he could do no more to save the woman he loved from eternal separation from him than if he had been an idiot or an infant, than if he had had no heart in his breast and no blood in his veins.  Whenever he met the vicar afterwards he did not even touch his hat, and ceased those outward observances of respect to the Church which he had always given before to please his master, who liked such example to be set by the steward to the peasantry.  \"If Ser Baldo send me away for it, so he must do,\" he thought. \"I will never set foot in the church again. I should choke that accursed parocco with his own wafer.\"  For suspicion is a poisonous weed which, if left to grow unchecked, soon reaches maturity, and Falko Melegari soon persuaded himself that his own suspicion was a truth, which only lacked time and testimony to become as clear to all eyes as it was to his.     CHAPTER IV.   Meantime, Gesualdo was striving with the utmost force that was in him to persuade the real criminal to confess publicly what he had told under the seal of confession. He saw the man secretly, and used every argument with which the doctrines of his Church and his own intense desires could supply him. But there is no obstinacy so dogged, no egotism so impenetrable, no shield against persuasion so absolute, as the stolid ignorance and self-love of a low mind. The Girellone turned a deaf ear to all censure as to all entreaty: he was stolidly indifferent to all the woe that he had caused and would cause if he remained silent. What was all that to him? The thought of the miller's widow shut up in prison pleased him; he had hated her as he had seen her in what he called her finery, going by him in the sunshine, with all her bravery of pearl necklace, of silver hair-pins, of gold watch and chain. Many and many a time he had thirsted to snatch at them and pull them off her. What right had she to them, she, a daughter of naked hungry folks, who dug and carted sea- and river-sand for a living? She was no better than himself! Now and then, Generosa had called him, in her careless, imperious fashion, to draw water or carry wood for her, and when she had done so she never had taken the trouble to bid him good-day or to say a good-natured word. His pride was hurt, and he had had much ado to restrain himself from calling her a daughter of beggars, a worm of the sand. Like her own people, he was pleased that she should now find her fine clothes and her jewelled trinkets of no avail to her, and that she should weep the light out of her big eyes, and the rose-bloom off her peach-like cheeks, in the squalor and nausea of a town prison.  Gesualdo, with all the force which a profound conviction that he speaks the truth lends to any speaker, wrestled for the soul of this dogged brute, and warned him of the punishment everlasting which would await him if he persisted in his refusal to surrender himself to justice. But he might as well have spoken to the great millstones at rest in the river-water. Why then had this wretch cast the burden of his vile secret on innocent shoulders? It was the most poignant anguish to him that he could awaken no sense of guilt in the conscience of the criminal. The man had come to him partly from a vague superstitious impulse, remnant of a credulity instilled into him in childhood, and partly from the want to _sfogare_ himself, as he called it,--to tell his story to some one,--which is characteristic of all weak minds in times of trouble and peril. It had relieved him to drag the priest into sharing his own guilty consciousness; he was half proud and half afraid of the manner in which he had slain his master, and bitterly incensed that he had done the deed for nothing; but beyond this he had no other emotion, except that he was glad that Generosa should suffer through and for it.  \"You will burn forever if you persist in such hideous wickedness,\" said Gesualdo again and again to him.  \"I will take my chance of that,\" said the man. \"Hell is far off, and the galleys are near.\"  \"But if you do not believe in my power to absolve you or leave you accursed, why did you ever confess to me?\" cried Gesualdo.  \"Because one must clear one's breast to somebody when one has a thing like that on one's mind,\" answered the Girellone, \"and I know you cannot tell of it again.\"  And from that position nothing moved him. No entreaties, threats, arguments, denunciations, stirred him a hair's-breadth. He had confessed _per sfogarsi_: that was all.  But one night after Gesualdo had thus spoken to him, vague fears assailed him,--terrors material, not spiritual: he had parted with his secret: who could tell that it might not come out like a sleuth-hound and find him and denounce him? He had told it to be at peace, but he was not at peace. He feared every instant to have the hand of the law upon him. Whenever he heard the trot of the carabineers' horses going through the village, or saw the white belts and cocked hats of gendarmes in the sunlight of the fields, a cold tremor of terror seized him lest the priest should, after all, have told. He knew that it was impossible, and yet he was afraid.  He counted up the money he had saved, a little roll of filthy and crumpled bank-notes for very small amounts, and wondered if they would be enough to take him across to America. They were very few, but his fear compelled him to trust to them. He invented a story of remittances which he had received from his brother, and told his fellow-laborers and his employer that he was invited to join that brother; and then he packed up his few clothes and went. At the mill and in the village they talked a little of it, saying that the Girellone was in luck, but that they for their parts would not care to go so far.  Gesualdo heard of his flight in the course of the day.  \"My God!--gone away!--out of the country?\" he cried, involuntarily, with white lips.  The people who heard him wondered. \"What could it matter to him that a carter had gone to seek his fortunes over the seas?\"  The Girellone had not been either such a good worker or such a good boon companion that any one at the mill or in the village should greatly regret him.  \"America gets all our rubbish,\" said the people. \"Much good may it do her!\"  Meantime, the man took his way across the country, and, sometimes by walking, sometimes by lifts in wagons, sometimes by helping charcoal-burners on the road, made his way, without spending much, to the sea-coast, and in the port of Leghorn took his passage in an emigrant-ship then loading there. The green canebrakes and peaceful millet-fields of Marca saw him no more.  But he had left the burden of his blood-guiltiness behind him, and it lay on the guiltless soul with the weight of the world.  So long as the man had remained in Marca there had been always a hope present with Gesualdo that he would persuade him to confess in a court of justice what he had confessed to the Church, or that some sequence of accidents would lead up to the discovery of his guilt. But with the ruffian gone across the seas, lost in that utter darkness which swallows up the lives of the poor and obscure when once they have left the hamlet in which their names mean something to their neighbors, this one hope was quenched; and Gesualdo in agony reproached himself with not having prevailed in his struggle for the wretch's soul,--with not having been eloquent enough, or wise enough, or stern enough, to awe him into declaration of his ghastly secret to the law.  His failure seemed to him a sign of heaven's wrath against himself.  \"How dare I,\" he thought, \"how dare I, feeble and timid and useless as I am, call myself a servant of God, or attempt to minister to other souls?\"  He had thought, like an imbecile, as he told himself, to be able to awaken the conscience and compel the public confession of this man, and the possibility of flight had never presented itself to his mind, natural and simple as had been such a course to a creature without remorse, continually haunted by personal fears of punishment. He, he alone on earth, knew the man's guilt; he, he alone, had the power to save Generosa, and could not use the power because the secrecy of his holy office was fastened on him like an iron padlock on his lips.  The days passed him like nightmares; he did his duties mechanically, scarcely consciously; the frightful alternative which was set before him seemed to parch up the very springs of life itself. He knew that he must look strange in the eyes of the people; his voice sounded strangely in his own ears; he began to feel that he was unworthy to administer the blessed bread to the living, to give the last unction to the dying: he knew that he was not at fault, and yet he felt that he was accursed. Choose what he would, he must commit some hateful sin.  The day appointed for the trial came: it was the 10th of May. A hot day, with the bees booming among the acacia-flowers, and the green tree-frogs shouting joyously above in the ilex-tops, and the lizards running in and out of the china-rose hedges on the highways. Many people of Marca were summoned as witnesses, and these went to the town in mule-carts or crazy chaises, with the farm-horse put in the shafts, and grumbled because they would lose their day's labor in their fields, and yet were pleasurably excited at the idea of seeing Generosa in the prisoner's dock, and being able themselves to tell all they knew, and a great deal that they did not know.  Falko Melegari rode over at dawn by himself, and Gesualdo with his housekeeper and sacristan, who were all summoned to give testimony, went, as they had no choice but to do, by the diligence, which started from Sant' Arturo, and rolled through the dusty roads, and over the bridges, and past the wayside shrines and shops and forges, across the country to the town.  The vicar never spoke throughout the four weary hours during which the rickety and crowded vehicle, with its poor, starved, bruised beasts, rumbled on its road through the lovely shadows and cool sunlight of the early morning. He held his breviary in his hand for form's sake, and, seeing him thus absorbed in holy meditation, as they thought, his garrulous neighbors did not disturb him, but chattered among themselves, filling the honeysuckle-scented air with the odors of garlic and wine and coarse tobacco.  Candida glanced at him anxiously from time to time, haunted by she could not have said what,--a vague presentiment of ill. His face looked very strange, she thought, and his closely-locked lips were white as the lips of a corpse. When the diligence was driven over the stones of the town, all the passengers by it descended at the first wine-house which they saw on the piazza, to eat and drink; but he, with never a word, motioned his housekeeper aside when she would have pressed food on him, and went into the great church of the place to pray alone.  The town was hot and dusty and sparsely peopled. It had brown walls and large brick palaces untenanted, and ancient towers, also of brick, pointing high to heaven. It was a place dear to the memory of lovers of art for the sake of some fine paintings of the Sienese school which hung in its churches, and was occasionally visited by strangers for sake of these; but for the most part it was utterly forgotten by the world; and its bridge of many arches, said to have been built by Augustus, seldom resounded to any other echoes than those of the heavy wheels of the hay- or corn-wagons coming in from the pastoral country around.  The court-house, where all great trials took place, stood in one of the bare, silent, dusty squares of the town. It had once been the ancient palace of the podest, and had the machicolated walls, the turreted towers, and the vast stairways and frescoed chambers of a larger and statelier time than ours. The hall of justice was a vast chamber pillared with marble, vaulted and painted, sombre and grand: it was closely thronged with country-folks; there was a scent of hay, of garlic, of smoking pipes hastily thrust into trouser-pockets, of unwashed flesh steaming hotly in the crowd and the close air. The judge was there with his officers, a Renaissance figure in black square cap and black gown. The accused was behind the cage assigned to such prisoners, guarded by carabineers and by the jailers. Gesualdo looked in once from a distant door-way; then, with a noise in his ears like the sound of the sea, and a deadly sickness on him, he stayed without in the audience-chamber, where a breath of air came to him up one of the staircases, there waiting until his name was called.  The trial began. Everything was the same as it had been in the preliminary examination which had preceded her committal on the charge of murder. The same depositions were made now that had then been made. In the interval, the people of Marca had forgotten a good deal, so added somewhat of their own invention to make up for the deficiency; but, on the whole, the testimony was the same, given with that large looseness of statement and absolute indifference to fact so characteristic of the Italian mind, the judge, from habit, sifting the chaff from the wheat in the evidence with unerring skill, and following with admirable patience the tortuous windings and the hazy imagination of the peasants he examined.  The examination of Gesualdo did not come on until the third day. These seventy or eighty hours of suspense were terrible to him. He scarcely broke his fast, or was conscious of what he did. The whole of the time was passed by him listening in the court of justice or praying in the churches. When at last he was summoned, a cold sweat bathed his face and hair; his hands trembled; he answered the interrogations of the judge and of the advocates almost at random; his replies seemed scarcely to be those of a rational being; he passionately affirmed her innocence with delirious repetition and emphasis, which produced on the minds of the examiners the contrary effect to that which he endeavored to create.  \"This priest knows that she is guilty,\" thought the president. \"He knows it. Perhaps he knows even more: perhaps he was her accomplice.\"  His evidence, his aspect, his wild and contradictory words, did as much harm to her cause as he ignorantly strove to do good. From other witnesses of Marca the judge had learned that a great friendship had always been seen to exist between the vicar of San Bartolo and Generosa F, and that on the morning when the murder was discovered the priest had removed the body of the dead man to the sacristy, forestalling the officers of justice, and disturbing the scene of the murder. A strong impression against him was created beforehand in the audience and on the bench; and his pallid, agitated countenance, his incoherent words, his wild eyes, which incessantly sought the face of the prisoner, all gave him the appearance of a man conscious of some guilt himself, and driven out of his mind by fear. The president cross-examined him without mercy, censured him, railed at him, and did his uttermost to extract the truth which he believed that Gesualdo concealed; but to no avail: incoherent and half insane as he seemed, he said no syllable which could betray that which he really knew. Only when his eyes rested on Generosa there was such an agony in them that she herself was startled by it.  \"Who would ever have dreamt that he would care so much?\" she thought. \"But he was always a tender soul; he always pitied the birds in the traps, and the oxen that went to the slaughter.\"  Reproved and censured without stint, for the president knew that to insult a priest was to merit promotion in high quarters, Gesualdo was at last permitted to escape from his place of torture. Blind and sick he got away through the crowd, past the officials, down the stairs, and out into the hot air. The piazza was thronged with people who could not find standing-room in the court-house. The murmur of their rapid and loud voices was like the noise of a sea on his ears; they had all the same burden. They all repeated like one man the same words, \"They will condemn her,\" and then wondered what sentence she would receive,--whether a score of years of seclusion, or a lifetime.  Gesualdo went through the chattering, curious, cruel throng, barbarous with that barbarity of the populace which in all countries sees with glee a bull die, a wrestler drop, a malefactor ascend the scaffold, or a rat scour the streets soaked in petroleum and burning alive. The dead man had been nothing to them, and his wife had done none of them any harm, yet there was not a man or a woman, a youth or a girl, in the crowd, who would not have felt that he or she was defrauded of his entertainment if she were acquitted by her judges, although yet there was a general sense among them that she had done no more than had been natural, and no more than had been her right.  The dark, slender, emaciated figure of the priest glided through their excited and boisterous groups; the air had the heat of summer, the sky above was blue and cloudless, the brown brick walls of the church and palace seemed baking in the light of the sun. In the corner of the square was a fountain, relic of the old times when the town had been a place of pageantry and power,--beautiful pale-green water, cold and fresh, leaping and flowing around marble dolphins. Gesualdo stooped and drank thirstily, as though he would never cease to drink, then went on his way and pushed aside the leathern curtain of the church door and entered into the coolness and solitude of that place of refuge.  There he stretched himself before the cross in prayer, and wept bitter, burning, unavailing tears for the burden which he bore of another's sin, and for his own helplessness beneath it, which seemed to him like a greater crime.  But even at the very altar of his God peace was denied him. Hurried, loud, impetuous steps from heavy boots fell on the old, worn, marble floor of the church, and Falko Melegari strode up behind him and laid a heavy hand upon his shoulders. The young man's face was deeply flushed, his eyes were savage, his breath was quick and uneven: he had no heed for the sanctity of the place or of his companion.  \"Get up and hear me,\" he said, roughly. \"They all say the verdict will be against her: you heard them.\"  Gesualdo made a gesture of assent.  \"Very well, then,\" said the steward, through his clinched teeth. \"If it be so indeed, I swear, as you and I live, that I will denounce you to the judges in her stead.\"  Gesualdo did not speak. He stood in a meditative attitude, with his arms folded on his chest. He did not express either surprise or indignation.  \"I will denounce you,\" repeated Melegari, made more furious by his silence. \"What did you do at night under the Grand Duke's poplars? Why did you carry in and screen the corpse? Does not the whole village talk of your strange ways and your altered habits? There is more than enough against you to send to the galleys a score of better men than you. Anyhow, I will denounce you if you do not make a clean breast of all you know to the president to-morrow. You are either the assasin or the accomplice, you accursed, black-coated hypocrite!\"  A slight flush rose on the waxen pallor of Gesualdo's face, but he still kept silence.  The young man watching him with eyes of hatred, saw guilt in that obstinate and mulish dumbness.  \"You dare not deny it, trained liar though you be!\" he said, with passionate scorn. \"Oh, wretched cur, who venture to call yourself a servitor of heaven, you would let her drag all her years out in misery to save your own miserable, puling, sexless, worthless life! Well, hear me, and understand. No one can say that I do not keep my word, and here, by the cross which hangs above us, I take my oath that if you do not tell all you know to-morrow, should she be condemned I will denounce you to the law, and if the law fail to do justice I will kill you as Tasso Tassilo was killed. May I die childless, penniless, and accursed if my hand fail!\"  Then, with no other word, he strode from the church, the golden afternoon sunshine streaming through the stained windows above and falling on his fair hair, his flushed face, his flaming eyes, till his common humanity seemed as if transfigured. He looked like the avenging angel of Tintoretto's Paradise.  Gesualdo stood immovable in the deserted church, his arms crossed on his breast, his head bent. A great resolve, a mighty inspiration, had descended on him with the furious words of his foe. Light had come to him as from heaven itself. He could not give up the secret which had been confided to him in the confessional, but he could give up himself. His brain was filled with legends of sacrifice and martyrdom. Why might he not become one of that holy band of martyrs?  Nay, he was too humble to place himself beside them even in thought. The utmost he could do, he knew, would be only expiation for what seemed to him his ineffaceable sin in letting any human affection, however harmless, unselfish, and distant, stain the singleness and purity of his devotion to his vows. He had been but a peasant-boy until he had taken his tender heart and his ignorant mind to the seminary, and he had been born with the soul of a St. Francis, of a San Rocco, of a St. John, out of place, out of time, in the world he lived in, and in which the passions of faith and of sacrifice were as strong as are the passions of lust and of selfishness in other natures. The spiritual world was to him a reality, and the earth, with its merciless and greedy peoples, its plague of lusts, its suffering hearts, its endless injustice, an unreal and hideous dream.  To his temper, the sacrifice which suddenly rose before him as his duty appeared one which would reconcile him at once to the Deity he had offended and the humanity he was tempted to betray. To his mind, enfeebled and exhausted by long fasting of the body and denial of every natural indulgence, such sacrifice of self seemed an imperious command from heaven. He would drag out his own life in misery and obloquy, indeed; but what of that? Had not the great martyrs and founders of his Church endured as much or more? Was it not by such torture voluntarily accepted and endured on earth that the grace of God was won?  He would tell a lie, indeed; he would draw down ignominy on the name of the Church; he would make men believe that an anointed priest was a common murderer, swayed by low and jealous hatreds; but of this he did not think. In the tension and perplexity of his tortured soul, the vision of a sacrifice in which he would be the only sufferer, in which the woman would be saved and the secret told to him be preserved, appeared as a heaven-sent solution of the doubts and difficulties in his path. Stretched in agonized prayer before one of the side altars of the church, he imagined the afternoon sunbeams streaming through the high window on his face to be the light of a celestial world, and in the hush and heat of the incense-scented air he believed that he heard a voice which cried to him, \"By suffering all things are made pure.\"  He was not a wise, or strong, or educated man. He had the heart of a poet and the mind of a child. There was a courage in him to which sacrifice was welcome, and there was a credulity in him which made all exaggeration of simple faith possible. He was young and ignorant and weak; yet at the core of his heart there was a dim heroism: he could suffer and be mute: and in the depths of his heart he loved this woman better than himself,--with a love which in his belief made him accursed for all time.  When he at last arose and went out of the church doors his mind was made up to the course that he would take: an immense calm had descended upon the unrest of his soul.  The day was done, the sun had set, the scarlet flame of its after-glow bathed all the rusty walls and dusty ground with colors of glory. The crowd had dispersed; there was no sound in the deserted square except the ripple of the water as it fell from the dolphins' mouths into the marble basin. As he heard that sweet familiar murmur of the falling stream, the tears rose in his eyes and blotted out the flame-like pomp and beauty of the skies. Never again would he hear the water of the Marca river rushing in cool autumn days past the poplar-stems and the primrose-roots upon its mossy banks; never again would he hear in the place of his birth the gray-green waves of Arno sweeping through the canebrakes to the sea.  At three of the clock on the following day the judgment was given in the court.  Generosa F was decreed guilty of the murder of her husband, and sentenced to twenty years of solitary confinement. She dropped like a stone when she heard the sentence, and was carried out from the court insensible. Her lover, when he heard it, gave a roar of anguish like that of some great beast in torment and dashed his head against the wall, and struggled like a mad bull in the hands of the men who tried to hold him. Gesualdo, waiting without on the head of the great staircase, did not even change countenance: to him this bitterness, as of the bitterness of death, had been long past; he had been long certain what the verdict would be; and he had many hours before resolved on his own part.  A great calm had come upon his soul, and his face had that tranquillity which comes alone from a soul which is at peace within itself.  The sultry afternoon shed its yellow light on the brown and gray and dusty town; the crowd poured out of the court-house, excited, contrite, voluble, pushing and bawling at one another, ready to take the side of the condemned creature now that she was the victim of the law. The priest alone of them all did not move: he remained sitting on the upright chair under a sculptured allegory of Justice and Equity which was on the arch above his head, and with the golden light of sunset falling down on him through the high casement above. He paid no heed to the hurrying of the crowd, to the tramp of guards, to the haste of clerks and officials eager to finish their day's work and get away to their wine and dominoes at the taverns. His hands mechanically held his breviary; his lips mechanically repeated a Latin formula of prayer. When all the people were gone, one of the custodians of the place touched his arm, telling him that they were about to close the doors. He raised his eyes like one who is wakened from a trance, and to the man said, quietly,--  \"I would see the president of the court for a moment quite alone. Is it possible?\"  After many demurs and much delay, they brought him into the presence of the judge in a small chamber of the great palace.  \"What do you want with me?\" asked the judge, looking nervously at the white face and the wild eyes of his unbidden visitant.  Gesualdo answered, \"I am come to tell you that you have condemned an innocent woman.\"  The judge looked at him with sardonic derision and contempt.  \"What more?\" he asked. \"If she be innocent, will you tell me who is guilty?\"  \"I am,\" replied the priest.         *       *       *       *       *  At his trial he never spoke.  With his head bowed and his hands clasped, he stood in the cage where she had stood, and never replied by any single word to the repeated interrogations of his judges. Many witnesses were called, and all they said testified to the apparent truth of his self-accusation. Those who had always vaguely suspected him, all those who had seen him close the door of the sacristy on the crowd when he had borne the murdered man within, the mule-drivers who had seen him digging at night under the great poplars, the sacristan who had been awakened by him that same night so early, even his old housekeeper, though she swore that he was a lamb, a saint, an angel, a creature too good for earth, a holy man whose mind was distraught by fasting, by visions,--these all, either wilfully or ignorantly, bore witness which confirmed his own confession. The men of law had the mould and grass dug up under the Grand Duke's poplar, and when the blood-stained knife was found therein, the very earth, it seemed, yielded up testimony against him.  In the end, after many weeks of investigation, Generosa was released, and he was sentenced in her place.  Her lover married her, and they went to live in his own country in the Lombard plains, and were happy and prosperous, and the village of Marca and the waters of its cane-shadowed stream knew them no more.  Sometimes she would say to her husband, \"I cannot think that he was guilty: there was some mystery in it.\" And her husband always laughed, and said in answer, \"He was guilty, be sure: it was I that frightened him into confession. Those black rats of the Church have livers as white as their coats are black.\"  Generosa did not wholly believe, but she thrust the grain of doubt away from her and played with her handsome children. And, after all, she mused, what doubt could there be? Did not Don Gesualdo himself reveal his guilt? and had he not always cared for her? and was not the whole population of Marca willing to bear witness that they had always suspected him and had only held their peace out of respect for the Church?  He himself lived two long years among the galley-slaves of the western coast: all that time he never spoke; and he was considered by the authorities to be insane. Then, in the damp and cold of the third winter, his lungs decayed, his frail strength gave way; he died of what they called consumption in the spring of the year. In his last moments there was seen a light of unspeakable ecstasy upon his face, a smile of unspeakable rapture on his mouth.  \"Laus Deus libera me!\" he murmured, as he died.  A bird came and sang at the narrow casement of his prison-cell as his spirit passed away. It was a nightingale,--perchance one of those who had once sung to him in the summer nights from the wild-rose hedge at Marca.     A RAINY JUNE.   _From the Prince di San Zenone, Claridge's, London, to the Duchessa dell'Aquila Fulva, Monterone, near Milano, Italy._  _Carissima Teresa_,--  I received your letter, which is delightful to me because it is yours, and terrible to me because it scolds me, abuses me, flies at me, makes me feel like a schoolboy who has had a _saponata_. Yes, it is quite true. I cannot help it She has bewitched me. She is a lily made into a woman. I feared you would be angry, especially angry because she is a foreigner; but the hour of fate has struck. You will not wonder when you see her. She is as blonde as the dawn and as pure as a pearl. It seems to me that I have never loved any woman at all in my life before. To love her is like plunging one's hand in cool spring-water on a midsummer noon. She is such repose; such innocence; such holiness! In the midst of this crowded, over-colored, vulgar London life--for it is very vulgar at its highest--she seems like some angel of purity. I saw her first standing with a knot of roses in her hand under a cedar-tree, at one of their afternoon clubs on the river. She was drinking a cup of tea: they are always drinking tea. And she is so white. I never saw anything so white except the snow on the Leonessa. She is not in the least like the fast young ladies of England of whom one sees so much in the winter at Rome. I do not like their fast young women. If you want a woman who is fast, a Parisienne is best, or even an American. Englishwomen overdo it. She is just like a primrose; like a piece of porcelain; like a soft, pale star shining in the morning. I write all kinds of poetry when I think of her. And then there is something _Sainte-Nitouche_ about her which is delicious because it is so real. The only thing which was wanting in her was that she ought to have been shut up in a convent, and I ought to have had to imperil my soul for all eternity by getting her over a stone wall with a silken ladder. But it is a prosaic age, and this is a very prosaic country. London amuses me; but it is such a crowd, and it is frightfully ugly. I cannot think how people who are so enormously rich as the English can put up with such ugliness. The houses are all too small, even the big ones. I have not seen a good ball-room. They say there are good ones in the country houses. The clubs are admirable; but life in general seems to me hurried, costly, ungraceful, very noisy, and almost entirely consecrated to eating. It is made up of a scramble and a mass of food. People engage themselves for dinners a month in advance. Everybody's engagement-book is so full that it is the burden of their days. They accept everything, and, at the eleventh hour, pick out what they prefer, and, to use their own language, \"throw over\" the rest. I do not think it is pretty behavior; but nobody seems to object to it. I wonder that the women do not do so; but they seem to be afraid of losing their men altogether if they exact good manners from them. People here are not at all well-mannered, to my taste,--neither the men nor the women. They are brusque and negligent, and have few _petite soins_. You should have come over for my marriage to show them all what an exquisite creature a Venetian patrician beauty can be. Why _would_ you marry that Piedmontese? Only two things seem to be of any importance in England: they are eating and politics. They eat all day long, and are always talking of Mr. Gladstone. Mr. Gladstone _m'embte_! Half of them say he is the destruction of England, the other half say he is the salvation of England. Myself, I don't care the least which he is; only I know they cannot keep him out of their conversation, one way or another, for five minutes, which, to an unprejudiced foreigner, is a _seccatura_. But to-morrow I go down into the country with my primrose,--all alone; to-morrow she will be mine altogether and unalterably, and I shall hear nothing about Mr. Gladstone or anything that is tiresome. Of course you are wondering that I should marry. I wonder myself; but, then, if I did not marry I should be compelled to say an eternal _addio_ to the Lenten Lily. She has such a spiked wall around her of male relatives and family greatness. It is not the convent wall; there is no ladder that will go over it; one must enter at the big front door, or not at all. Felicitate me, and yet compassionate me! I am going to Paradise, no doubt; but I have the uncomfortable doubt as to whether it will suit me, which all people who are going to Paradise always do feel. Why? Because we are mortal or because we are sinners? _A rivederci, cara mia Teresina!_ Write to me at my future Eden: it is called Coombe-Bysset, near Luton, Bedfordshire. We are to be there a month. It is the choice of my primrose.         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Lady Mary Bruton, Belgrave Square, London, to Mrs. D'Arcy, British Embassy, Berlin._  The season has been horribly dull; quantities of marriages. People always will marry, however dull it is. The one most talked about is that of the Cowes's second daughter, Lady Gladys, with the Prince of San Zenone. She is one of the beauties, but a very simple girl, quite old-fashioned, indeed. She has refused Lord Hampshire, and a good many other people, and then fallen in love in a week with this Roman, who is certainly as handsome as a picture. But Cowes didn't like it at all; he gave in because he couldn't help it; but he was dreadfully vexed that the Hampshire affair did not come off instead. Hampshire is such a good creature, and his estates are close to theirs. It is certainly very provoking for them that this Italian must take it into his head to spend a season in London, and lead the cotillon so beautifully that all the young women talked of nothing else but his charms.         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Lady Mona St. Clair, Grosvenor Square, London, to Miss Burns, Schooner-yacht Persephone, off Cherbourg._  The wedding was very pretty yesterday. We had frocks of tussore silk, with bouquets of orchids and Penelope Boothby caps. She looked very pretty, but as white as her gown,--such a goose!--it was ivory satin, with _point de Venise_. He is quite too handsome, and I cannot think what he could see in her. He gave us each a locket with _her_ portrait inside. I wished it had been _his_. I dare say Hampshire would have been better for her, and worn longer, than Romeo. Lord Cowes is furious about Romeo. He detests the religion and all that, and he could hardly make himself look pleasant even at church. Of course they were two ceremonies. The Cardinal had consented at last, though I believe he had made all kinds of fuss first. Lady Gladys, you know, is very, _very_ High Church, and I suppose that reconciled a little the very irreconcilable Cardinal. She thinks of nothing but the Church, and her missions, and her poor people. I am afraid the Roman prince will get dreadfully bored. And they are going down into Bedfordshire, of all places, to be shut up for a month! It is very stupid of her, and such a wet season as it is! They are going to Coombe-Bysset, her aunt Lady Caroline's place. I fancy Romeo will soon be bored, and I don't think Coombe-Bysset at all judicious. I would have gone to Homburg, or Deauville, or Japan.         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Princess di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset, Luton, Bedfordshire, to the Countess of Cowes, London._  DEAREST MOTHER,--  I am too, too, too happy. It is no use writing about it. I would if I could, but I _can't_. He is delighted with Coombe, and says the verdure is something wonderful. We got here just as the sun was setting. There were all Aunt Carrie's school-children out to meet us with baskets of roses. Piero said they looked like bigger roses themselves. He is enchanted with England. It is very fine to-day, and I do so hope it won't rain; but the glass is falling. Forgive a hurried word like this. I am going to take Piero on the lake. I know you haven't liked it, dear; but, I am sure, when you see how happy I am you will say there was never any one like him on earth.         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Countess of Cowes, Cowes House, London, to the Duchess of Dunne, Wavernake, Worcestershire._  No, I confess I do not approve of the marriage: it will take her away from us, and I am afraid she won't be happy. She has always had such very _exalt_ ideas. She is not in the least the girl of the period. Of course she was taken by his picturesque face and his admirable manners. His manners are really wonderful in these days, when our men have none at all; and he has charmingly caressing and deferential ways, which win even me. I cannot wonder at her, poor child, but I am afraid: candidly, I am afraid! He makes all our men look like ploughboys. And it was all done in such tremendous haste that she had no time to reason or reflect; and I don't think they have said two serious words to each other. If only it had been dear, good Hampshire, whom we have known all our lives, and whose lands march with ours! But that was too good to be, I suppose, and there was no positive objection we could raise to San Zenone. We could not refuse his proposals because he is too good-looking, isn't an Englishman, and has a mother who is reputed _maitresse femme_. Gladys writes from Coombe as from the seventh heaven. They have been married three days! But I fear she will have trouble before her. I fear he is weak and unstable, and will not back her up among his own people when she goes among them; and though, nowadays, a man and woman, once wedded, see so little of each other, Gladys is not quite of the time in her notions. She will take it all very seriously, poor child, and expect the idyl to be prolonged over the honeymoon. And she is very English in her tastes, and has been so very little out of England. However, every girl in London is envying her. It is only her father and I who see these little black specks on the fruit she has plucked. They are gone to Coombe by her wish. I think it would have been wiser not to subject an Italian to such an ordeal as a wet English June in an utterly lonely country house. You know, even Englishmen, who can always find such refuge and comfort in prize pigs and straw-yards and unusually big mangolds, get bored if they are in the country when there is nothing to shoot; and Englishmen are used to being drenched to the skin every time they move out. He is not. Lord Cowes says love is like a cotton frock,--very pretty as long as the sun shines, but it won't stand a wetting. I wish you had been here: Gladys looked quite lovely. Cardinal Manning most kindly relented, and the whole thing went off very well. Of the San Zenone family, there was only present Don Fabrizio, the younger son, a very good-looking young man. The terrible duchess didn't come, on account, I think, of her sulks. She hates the marriage on her side as much as we do on ours, I am sure. Really, one must believe a little bit in fate. I do think that Gladys would soon have resigned herself to accepting Hampshire out of sheer fatigue at saying \"No;\" and, besides, she knew that we are so fond of him, and to live in the same county was such an attraction. But this irresistible young Roman must take it into his head that he wished to see a London season, and when once they had met (it was one afternoon at Ranelagh) there was no more chance for our poor, dear, good, stupid neighbor. Well, we must hope for the best!         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Prince Piero di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset, to the Duchessa dell'Aquila Fulva, Palazzo Fulva, Milano._  _Carissima mia_,--  There are quantities of nightingales in little green nests at this season. I am a nightingale in a green nest. I never saw anything so green as this Paradise of mine. It is certainly Paradise. If I feel a little _dpays_ in it, it is only because I have been such a sinner. No doubt it is only that. Paradise is chilly: this is its only fault. It is the 6th of June, and we have fires. Fires in the dressing-rooms, fires in the drawing-rooms, fires at both ends of the library, fires on both sides of the hall, fires everywhere; and, with all of them, I shiver. I cannot help shivering, and I feel convinced that, in my rapture, I have mistaken the month: it must be December. It is all enchantingly pretty here; the whole place looks in such perfect order that it might have been taken out of a box last night. I have a little the sensation of being always at church. That, no doubt, is the effect of the first step towards virtue that I have ever made. Pray do not think that I am not perfectly happy. I should be more sensible of my happiness, no doubt, if I had not quite such a feeling, due to the dampness of the air, of having been put into an aquarium like a jellyfish. But Gladys is adorable in every way, and, if she were not quite so easily scared, would be perfection. It was that little air of hers, like that of some irresistible Alpine flower, which bewitched me. But when one has got the Alpine flower, one cannot live forever on it--_ma basta_! I was curious to know what a Northern woman was like: I know now. She is exquisite, but a little monotonous and a little prudish. Certainly she will never compromise me; but then, perhaps, she will never let me compromise myself, and that will be terrible! I am ungrateful; all men are ungrateful; but, then, is it not a little the women's fault? They do keep so very close to one. Now, an angel, you know, becomes tiresome if one never gets out of the shadow of its wings. Here, at Coombe-Bysset, the angel fills the horizon.         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Duchessa dell'Aquila Fulva, Palazzo Fulva, Milano, to the Prince Piero di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset, Luton, Bedfordshire, England._  _Caro mio Pierino_,--  Are you sure you have an angel? People have a trick of always calling very commonplace women angels. \"She is an angel\" is a polite way of saying, \"She is a bore.\" I am not sure, either, that I should care to live with a veritable angel. One would see too much of the wings, as you say; and even a guardian angel must be the _terzo incommodo_ sometimes. Why _would_ you marry an English girl? I dare say she is so good-tempered that she never contradicts you, and you grow peevish out of sheer weariness at having everything your own way. If you had married Nicoletta, as I wanted you to do, she would have flown at you like a little tigress a dozen times a week, and kept you on the _qui vive_ to please her. We know what our own men want. I have half a mind to write to your wife and tell her that no Italian is comfortable unless he has his ears boxed twice a day. If your wife would be a little disagreeable, probably you would adore her. But it is a great mistake, _Pierino mio_, to confuse marriage and love. In reality, they have no more to do with one another than a horse-chestnut and a chestnut horse--than the _zuccone_ that means a vegetable and the _zuccone_ that means a simpleton. I should imagine that your wet English bird's-nest will force you to realize this truth with lamentable rapidity.         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Princess di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset, Luton, Bedfordshire, to Lady Gwendolen Dormer, British Embassy, Vienna._  DEAREST GWEN,--  I did promise, I know, to write to you at once and tell you everything; and a whole week is gone, and I couldn't do it, I really couldn't; and even now I don't know where to begin. I suppose I am dreadfully _vieux jeu_. I suppose you will only laugh at me, and say \"spoons.\" How glad I am Piero cannot say a word of English, and so I never hear that dreadful jargon, which I do think so ugly and so vulgar, though you are all so fond of it. I ought not to have come to Coombe-Bysset: at least, they all said it was silly. Nessie Fitzgerald was back in London before the week was out, and doing a play. To be sure, she was married in October, and she didn't care a bit about him; and I suppose that made all the difference. To me it seems so much more natural to shut one's self up, and Piero thought so too; but I am half afraid he finds it a little dull now. You see, we knew very little of one another. He came for a month of the London season, and he met me at Ranelagh, and he danced the cotillon with me at a good many houses, and we cared for one another in a week, and were married in a month, as you know. Papa hated it because it wasn't Burlington or Lord Hampshire. But he couldn't really object, because the San Zenone are such a great Roman family, and all the world knows them; and they are Spanish dukes as well as Italian princes. And Piero is such a grand gentleman, and made quite superb settlements,--much more, papa said, than he could have expected, so poor as we are. But what I meant was, meeting like that in the rush of the season, at balls, and dinners, and garden-parties, and luncheons at Hurlingham, and being married to one another just before Ascot, we really knew nothing at all of each other's tastes, or habits, or character. And when, on the first morning at Coombe, we realized that we were together for life, I think we both felt very odd. We adored one another, but we didn't know what to talk about; we never had talked to each other; we never had time. And I am afraid there is something of this feeling with him. I am afraid he is dreadfully bored, and I told him so, and he answered, \"_Angelina mia_, your admirable countrymen are not bored in the country because they are always eating. They eat a big breakfast, they eat a big luncheon, they eat a big dinner, they are always eating. Myself, I have not that resource. Give me a little coffee and a little wine, and let me eat only once a day. You never told me I was expected to absorb food like the crocodiles.\" What would he say if he saw a hunting-breakfast in the shires? I suppose life _is_ very material in England. I think it is why there is so much typhus fever. Do you know, he wasn't going to dress for dinner because we were alone. As if that was any reason! I told him it would look so odd to the servants if he didn't dress, so he has done so since. But he says it is a _seccatura_ (this means, I believe, a bore), and he told me we English sacrifice our whole lives to fuss, form, and the outside of things. There is a good deal of truth in this. What numbers of people one knows who are ever so poor, and who yet, for the sake of the look of the thing, get into debt over their ears! And, then, quantities of them go to church for the form of the thing, when they don't _believe_ one atom; they will tell you at luncheon that they don't. I fancy Italians are much more honest than we are in this sort of way. Piero says if they are poor they don't mind saying so, and if they have no religion they don't pretend to have any. He declares we English spoil all our lives because we fancy it is our duty to pretend to be something we are not. Now, isn't that really very true? I am sure you would delight in all he says. He is so original, so unconventional. Our people think him ignorant because he doesn't read and doesn't care a straw about politics. But I assure you he is as clever as anything can be; and he doesn't get his ideas out of newspapers, nor repeat like a parrot what his chief of party tells him. I do wish you could have come over and could have seen him. It was so unkind of you to be ill just at the very time of my marriage. You know that it is only to you that I ever say quite what I feel about things. The girls are too young, and mamma doesn't understand. She never could see why I would not marry poor Hampshire. She always said that I should care for him in time. I don't think mamma can ever have been in love with anybody. I wonder what _she_ married for: don't you?         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Prince Piero di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset, to the Count Zazzari, Italian Legation, London._  _Caro Gigi_,--  Pray send me all the French novels you can find, and a case of Turkish cigarettes. I am in Paradise, but Paradise is a little dull, and exceedingly damp, at least in England. Does it always rain in this country? It has rained here without stopping for seventeen days and a half. I produce upon myself the impression of being one of those larks who sit behind wires on a little square of wet grass. I should like to run up to London. I see you have Jeanne Granier and the others; but I suppose it would be against all the unwritten canons of a honeymoon. What a strange institution. A honeymoon! Who first invented it?         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Prince di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset, Luton, Bedfordshire, to the Duchessa dell'Aquila Fulva, Palazzo Fulva, Milano._  _Cara Teresina_,--  I ought to have written to you long since, but you know I am not fond of writing. I really, also, have nothing to say. Happy the people who have no history. I am like that people. I was made happy two weeks ago; I have been happy ever since. It is slightly monotonous. How can you vary happiness except by quarrelling a little? And then it would not be happiness any longer. It seems to me that happiness is like an omelet, best impromptu. Do not think that I am ungrateful, however, either to fate or to the charming innocent who has become my companion. We have not two ideas in common. She is lovely to look at, to caress, to adore; but what to say to her I confess I have no notion. Love ought never have to find dinner-table conversation. He ought to climb up by a ladder and get over a balcony, and when his ecstasies are ended, he ought to go the same way. I fancy she is cleverer than I am; but, as that would be a discovery fatal to our comfort, I endeavor not to make it. She is extraordinarily sweet-tempered; indeed, so much so that it makes me angry; it gives one no excuse for being impatient. She is divine, exquisite, nymph-like; but, alas, she is a prude! Never was any creature on earth so exquisitely sensitive, so easily shocked. To live with her is to walk upon egg-shells. Of course it is very nice in a wife,--very \"proper,\" as the English say; but it is not amusing. It amused me at first, but now it seems to me a defect. She has brought me down to this terribly damp and very green place, where it rains every day and night. There is a library without novels; there is a cellar without absinthe; there is a _cuisine_ without tomatoes, or garlic, or any oil at all; there is an admirably-ordered establishment, so quiet that I fancy I am in a penitentiary. There are some adorably fine horses, and there are acres of glass houses used to grow fruits that we throw in Italy to the pigs. By the way, there are also several of our field-flowers in the conservatories. We eat pretty nearly all day; there is nothing else to do. Outside, the scenery is oppressively green, the green of spinach; there is no variety; there are no ilexes, and there are no olives. I understand now why the English painters give such staring colors; unless the colors scream, you don't see them in this aqueous, dim atmosphere. That is why a benign Providence has made the landscape _aux pinards_. I think the air here, inside and out, must weigh heavily; it lies on one's lungs like a sponge. I once went down in a diving-bell when I was a boy; I have the sensation in this country of being always down in a diving-bell. The scamp Toniello, whom you may remember as having played Leporello to my Don Giovanno ever since we were lads, amuses himself with making love to all the pretty maidens in the village; but, then, I must not do that--now. They are not very pretty, either. They have very big teeth, and very long upper lips. Their skins, however, are admirable. For a horse's skin and a woman's there is no land comparable to England. It is the country of grooming.         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Princess di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset, to Lady Gwendolen Chichester, British Embassy, St. Petersburg._  He laughed at me because I went to church yesterday, and really I only went because I thought it _right_. We have been here a fortnight, and I have never been to church at all till yesterday, and you know how very serious dear Aunt Carrie is. To-day, as it is the second Sunday I have been here, I thought I ought to go just once, and I did go; but it was dreadfully pompous and lonely in the big red pew, and the villagers stared so, and all the little girls of the village giggled, and looked at me from under their sun-bonnets. Dear Mr. Coate preached a sermon on Marriage. It was very kind of him; but oh, how I wished he hadn't! When I got back, Piero was playing billiards with his servant. I wondered what Mr. Coate would have thought of him. To be sure, English clergymen have to get used to fast Sundays now, when the country houses are full. It is such a dear little yew walk to the church from the house here, not twenty yards long, and all lined with fuchsia. Do you remember it? Even Piero admits that it is very pretty, only he says it is a vignette prettiness,--which, I suppose, is true. \"You can see no horizon, only a green wall,\" he keeps complaining; and his beautiful, lustrous eyes look as if they were made to gaze through endless fields of light. When I asked him yesterday what he really thought of England, what do you suppose he said? He said, \"_Mia cara_, I think it would be a most delightful country if it had one-fifth of its population, one-half of its houses, a tithe of its dinners, a quarter of its machinery, none of its factories, and a wholly different atmosphere!\" I suppose this means that he dislikes it. I think him handsomer than ever. I sent you his photograph, but that can give you no idea of him. He is like one of his own marble statues. We came to Coombe-Bysset directly after the ceremony, and we are here still. I could stay on forever. It is so lovely in these Bedfordshire woods in mid-June. But I am afraid--just the very least bit afraid--that Piero may get bored with me--me--me--nothing but me. He is an angel. We ride in the morning, we sing and play in the evening. We adore each other all the twenty-four hours through. I wonder how I could have lived without him. I am longing to see all he tells me about his great marble palaces, and his immense dream-like villas, and his gardens with their multitude of statues, and the wonderful light that is over it all. He protests it is always twilight with us in England. It seems so absurd, when nowadays everybody knows everything about everywhere, that I should never have been to Italy. But we were such country mice down at dear old, dull, green, muddy Ditchworth. Lanciano, the biggest of all their big places, must be like a poem. It is a great house, all of different-colored marbles, set amidst ilex groves on the mountainside, with cascades like Terni, and gardens that were planned by Giulio Romano, and temples that were there in the days of Horace. I long to see it all, and yet I hope he will not want to leave Coombe yet. There is no place like the place where one is _first_ happy. And, somehow, I fancy I look better in these homely low rooms of Aunt Carrie's, with their Chippendale furniture and their smell of dry rose-leaves, than I shall do in those enormous palaces which want a Semiramis or a Cleopatra. They were kind enough to make a fuss about me in London, but I never thought much of myself, and I am afraid I must seem rather dull to Piero, who is so brilliant himself and has all kinds of talents. You know I never was clever, and really--really--I haven't an idea what to talk to him about when we don't talk about ourselves. And then the weather provokes him. We have hardly had one fine day since we came; and no doubt it seems very gray and chilly to an Italian. \"It cannot be June!\" he says, a dozen times a week. And when the whole day is rainy, as it is very often, for our Junes are such wet ones nowadays, I can see he gets impatient. He doesn't care for reading; he is fond of billiards, but I don't play a good enough game to be any amusement to him. And though he sings divinely, as I told you, he sings as the birds do,--just when the mood is on him. He does not care about music as a science in the least. He laughed when I said so. He declared it was no more a science than love is. Perhaps love ought to be a science too, in a way, or else it won't last. There has been a scandal in the village, caused by his servant Toniello. An infuriated father came up to the house this morning about it. He is named John Best: he has one of Aunt Carrie's biggest farms. He was in such a dreadful rage, and I had to talk to him, because, of course, Piero couldn't understand him. Only when I translated what he said, Piero laughed till he cried, and offered him a cigarette, and called him \"_figlio mio_,\" which only made Mr. John Best purple with fury, and he went away in a greater rage than he had been in when he came, swearing he \"would do for the Papist.\" I have sent for the steward. I am afraid Aunt Carrie will be terribly annoyed. It has always been such a model village. Not a public-house near for six miles, and all the girls such demure, quiet little maidens. The terrible Roman valet, with his starry eyes and his mandoline, and his audacities, has been like Mephistopheles in the opera to this secluded and innocent little hamlet. I beg Piero to send him away; but he looks unutterably reproachful, and declares he really cannot live without Toniello; and what can I say?         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Lady Gwendolen Chichester, St. Petersburg, to the Princess di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset._  You are quite in the wrong, my poor pet. If you were only a little older, and ever so much wiser, you would have telegraphed to the libraries yourself for the French books; you would have laughed at them when he laughed, and, instead of taking Mr. John Best as a tragedy, you would have made him into a little burlesque, which would have amused your husband for five minutes as much as Gyp or Jean Richepin. I begin to think I should have married your Roman prince, and you should have married my good, dull George, whom a perverse destiny has shoved into diplomacy. Your Roman scandalizes you, and my George bores me. Such is marriage, my dear, all the world over. What is the old story? That Jove broke all the walnuts, and each half is always uselessly seeking its fellow.         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Princess di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset, Luton, Bedfordshire, to the Lady Gwendolin Chichester, British Embassy, St. Petersburg._  But, surely, if he loved me, he would be as perfectly happy with me alone as I am with him alone. I want no other companion, no other interest, no other thought.         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Lady Gwendolen Chichester, British Embassy, St. Petersburg, to the Princess di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset, Luton, Bedfordshire._  Of course you do not, because you are a woman. San Zenone is your god, your idol, your ideal, your universe. But _you_ are only one out of the many women who have pleased him, and attached to the pleasure you afford him is the very uncomfortable conviction that he will never be able to get away from you. My dear child, I have no patience with any woman when she says, \"He does not love me.\" If he does not, it is probably the woman's fault. Probably she has worried him. Love dies directly it is worried, quite naturally. Poor Gladys! You were always such a good child; you were always devoted to your old women, and your queer little orphans, and your pet cripples, and your East End missions. It certainly is hard that you should have fallen into the hands of a soulless Italian, who reads naughty novels all day long and sighs for the flesh-pots of Egypt! But, my child, in reason's name, what did you expect? Did you think that all in a moment he would sigh to hear Canon Farrar or Dean Liddell, take his guitar to a concert in Seven Dials, and teach Italian to Bethnal Green babies? Be reasonable, and let your poor caged bird fly out of Coombe-Bysset, which will certainly be your worst enemy if you shut him up in it much longer.         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Prince di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset, to the Duchessa dell'Aquila Fulva, Palazzo Fulva, Milano._  I am still in my box of wet moss. I have been in it two weeks, four days, and eleven hours, by the calendar and the clocks. I have read all my novels. I have spelled through my \"Figaro,\" from the title to the printer's address, every morning. I have smoked twenty cigarettes every twenty minutes, and I have yawned as many times. This is Paradise, I know it; I tell myself so; but, still,--I cannot help it,--I yawn. There is a pale, watery sun, which shines fitfully. There is a quantity of soaked hay, which they are going to dry by machinery. There is a great variety of muddy lanes in which to ride. There is a post-office seven miles off, and a telegraph-station fifteen miles farther off. The _ensemble_ is not animated. When you go out you see very sleek cattle, very white sheep, very fat children. You may meet at intervals laboring-people, very round-shouldered and very sulky. You also meet, if you are in luck's way, with a traction-engine; and wherever you look you perceive a church-steeple. It is all very harmless, except the traction-engine, but it is not animated, or enlivening. You will not wonder that I soon came to the end of my French novels. The French novels have enabled me to discover that my angel is very easily ruffled. In fact, she is that touchy thing, a saint. I had no idea that she was a saint when I saw her drinking her cup of tea in that garden on the Thames. True, she had her lovely little serene, holy, _noli-me-tangere_ air; but I thought that would pass. It does not pass. And when I wanted her to laugh with me at \"Autour du Mariage,\" she blushed up to the eyes, and was offended. What am I to do? I am no saint. I cannot pretend to be one. I am not worse than other men, but I like to amuse myself. I cannot go through life singing a _miserere_. I am afraid we shall quarrel. You think that very wholesome. But there are quarrels and quarrels. Some clear the air like thunderstorms. Ours are little irritating differences, which end in her bursting into tears, and in myself looking ridiculous and feeling a brute. She has cried quite a number of times in the last fortnight. I dare say, if she went into a rage, as you justly say Nicoletta would do, and, you might have added, you have done, it would rouse me, and I should be ready to strike her, and should end in covering her with kisses. But she only turns her eyes on me like a dying fawn, bursts into tears, and goes out of the room. Then she comes in again--to dinner, perhaps, or to that odd ceremony, five-o'clock tea--with her little sad, stiff, reproachful air as of a martyr, answers meekly, and makes me again feel a brute. The English sulk a long time, I think. We are at daggers drawn one moment, but then we kiss and forget the next. We are more passionate, but we are more amiable. I want to get away, to go to Paris, Homburg, Trouville, anywhere, but I dare not propose it. I only drop adroit hints. If I should die of _ennui_, and be buried under the wet moss forever, weep for me.         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Princess di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset,' to Lady Gwendolen Chichester, St. Petersburg._  Coombe is quite too lovely now. It does rain sometimes, certainly; but between the showers it is so delicious. I asked Piero to come out and hear the nightingale,--there really is one in the home wood,--and he laughed at the idea. He said, \"We have hundreds of nightingales shouting all day and all night at Lanciano. We don't think about them; we eat them in _pasta_: they are very good.\" Fancy eating a nightingale! You might as well eat Romeo and Juliet. Piero has got a number of French books from London, and he lies about on the couches and reads them. He wants me to listen to naughty bits of fun out of them; but I will not, and then he calls me a prude, and gets angry. I don't see why he shouldn't laugh as much as he likes himself without telling me why he laughed. I dislike that sort of thing. I am horribly afraid I shall care for nothing but him all my life; while he--he yawned yesterday. Papa said to me, before we were married, \"My dear little girl, San Zenone put on such a lot of steam at first, he'll be obliged to ease his pace after a bit. Don't be vexed if you find the thing cooling!\" Now, papa speaks so oddly; always that sort of floundering, bald metaphor: you remember it; but I knew what he meant. Nobody could _go on_ being such a lover as Piero was. Ah, dear, it is in the past already! No, I don't quite mean that. He is Romeo still very often, and he sings me the divinest love-songs, lying at my feet on cushions, in the moonlight. But it is not quite the same thing as it was at first. He found fault with one of my gowns this morning, and said I was _fagote_. _Fagote!_ I am terribly frightened lest Coombe has bored him too much. I would come here. I wanted to be utterly out of the world, and so did he; and I'm sure there isn't a lovers' nest anywhere comparable to Coombe in midsummer. You remember the rose-garden, and the lime-avenues, and the chapel ruins by the little lake? When Aunt Carrie offered it to us for this June I was so delighted; but now I am half afraid the choice of it was a mistake, and that he does not know what to do with himself. He is _dpays_. I cried a little yesterday: it was too silly, but I couldn't help it. He laughed at me, but he got a little angry. \"_Enfin que veux-tu?_\" he said, impatiently: \"_je suis  toi, bien  toi, beaucoup trop  toi!_\" He seemed to me to regret being mine. I told him so: he was more angry. It was, I suppose, what you would call a scene. In five minutes he was penitent, and caressed me as only he can do; and the sun came out, and we went into the woods and heard the nightingale; but the remembrance of it alarms me. If he can say as much as this in a month, what can he say in a year? I do not think I am silly. I had two London seasons, and all those country houses show one the world. I know people, when they are married, are always glad to get away from one another; they are always flirting with other people. But I should be miserable if I thought it would ever be like that with Piero and me. I worship his very shadow, and he does--or he did--worship mine. Why should that change? Why should it not go on forever, as it does in poems? If it can't, why doesn't one die?         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Lady Gwendolen Chichester, St. Petersburg, to the Princess di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset._  What a goose you are, you dearest Gladys! You were always like that. To all you have said I can only reply, \"_connu_.\" When girls are romantic--and you always were, though it was quite gone out ages before our time--they always expect husbands to remain lovers. Now, my pet, you might just as well expect hay to remain grass. Papa was quite right. When there is such a lot of steam on, it must go off by degrees. I am afraid, too, you have begun with the passion, and the rapture, and the mutual adoration, and all the rest of it, which is _quite, quite gone out_. People don't feel in that sort of way nowadays. Nobody cares much: a sort of good-humored liking is the utmost one sees. But you were always such a goose! And now you must marry an Italian, and expect it all to be balconies, and guitars, and moonlight, for ever and ever. I think it quite natural he should want to get to Paris. You should never have taken him to Coombe. I do remember the rose-gardens, and the lime-avenues, and the ruins; and I remember being sent down there when I had too strong a flirtation with Philip Rous, who was in F. O. and had nothing a year. You were a baby then, and I remember that I was bored to the very brink of suicide: I have detested the smell of a lime-tree ever since. I can sympathize with the prince if he longs to get away. There can't be anything for him to do all day long except smoke. The photo of him is wonderfully handsome; but can you live all your life, my dear, on a profile?         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Princess di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset, to the Lady Gwendolen Chichester, St. Petersburg._  Because almost all Englishmen have snub noses, Englishwomen always think there is something immoral and delusive about a good profile. At all events, you will admit that the latter is the more agreeable object of contemplation. It still rains,--rains dreadfully. The meadows are soaked and they can't get the hay in, and we can't get out of the house. Piero does smoke, and he does yawn. He has been looking in the library for a French novel, but there is nothing except Mrs. Craven's goody-goody books and a boy's tale by Jules Verne. I am afraid you and mamma are right. Coombe, in a wet June, is not the place for a Roman who knows his Paris by heart and doesn't like the country anywhere. We seem to do nothing but eat. I put on an ulster and high boots, and I don't mind the rain a bit; but he screams when he sees me in an ulster. \"You have no more figure in that thing than if you were a Bologna sausage,\" he says to me; and certainly ulsters are very ugly. But I had a delicious fortnight with the duchess in a driving-tour in West-meath. We only took our ulsters with us, and it poured all the time, and we stayed in bed in the little inns while our things dried, and it was immense fun: the duke drove us. But Piero would not like that sort of thing. He is like a cat about rain. He likes to shut the house up early, and have the gas lit, and forget that it is all slop and mist outside. He declares that we have made a mistake in the calendar, and that it is November, not June. I change my gowns three times a day, just as if there were a large house-party; but I feel I look awfully monotonous to him. I am afraid I never was amusing. I always envy those women who are all _chic_ and \"go,\" who can make men laugh so at rubbish. They seem to carry about with them a sort of exhilarating ether. I don't think they are the best sort of women; but they do so amuse the men. I would give twenty years of my life if I could amuse Piero. He adores me; but that is another thing. That does not prevent him shaking the barometer and yawning. He seems happiest when he is talking Italian with his servant, Toniello. Toniello is allowed to play billiards with him sometimes. He is a very gay, merry, saucy, beautiful-eyed Roman. He has made all the maids in the house and all the farmers' daughters round Coombe in love with him, and I told you how he had scandalized one of the best tenants, Mr. John Best. The Bedford rustics all vow vengeance against him; but he twangs his mandoline, and sings away at the top of his voice, and doesn't care a straw that the butler loathes him, the house-steward abhors him, the grooms would horsewhip him if they dared, and the young farmers audibly threaten to duck him in the pond. Toniello is very fond of his master, but he does not extend his allegiance to me. Do you remember Mrs. Stevens, Aunt Caroline's model housekeeper? You should see her face when she chances to hear Piero laughing and talking with Toniello. I think she believes that the end of the world has come. Piero calls Toniello \"_figliolo mio_\" and \"_caro mio_,\" just as if they were cousins or brothers. It appears this is the Italian way. They are very proud in their own fashion, but it isn't our fashion. However, I am glad the man is there when I hear the click of the billiard-balls, and the splash of the rain-drops on the window-panes. We have been here just three weeks. \"_Dio!_ it seems three years,\" Piero said, when I reminded him of it, this morning. For me, I don't know whether it is like a single day's dream or a whole eternity. You know what I mean. But I wish--I wish--it seemed either the day's dream or the eternity of Paradise to him! I dare say it is all my fault in coming to these quiet, bay-windowed, Queen-Anne rooms, and the old-fashioned servants, and the dreary lookout over the soaking hay-fields. But the sun does come out sometimes, and then the wet roses smell so sweet, and the wet lime-blossoms glisten in the light, and the larks sing overhead, and the woods are so green and so fresh. Still, I don't think he likes it even then: it is all too moist, too windy, too dim, for him. When I put a rose in his button-hole this morning, it shook the drops over him, and he said, \"_Mais quel pays!--mme une fleur c'est une douche d'eau froide!_\" Last month, if I had put a dandelion in his coat, he would have sworn it had the odor of the magnolia and the beauty of the orchid. It is just twenty-two days ago since we came here, and the first four or five days he never cared whether it rained or not: he only cared to lie at my feet, really, literally. We were all in all to each other, just like Cupid and Psyche. And now--he will play billiards with Toniello to pass the time, and he is longing for his _petits thtres_. Is it my fault? I torment myself with a thousand self-accusations. Is it possible I can have been tiresome, dull, over-exacting? Is it possible he can be disappointed in me?         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Lady Gwendolen Chichester, St. Petersburg, to the Princess di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset._  No, it isn't your fault, you dear little donkey: it is only the natural sequence of things. Men are always like that when the woman loves them: when she don't, they behave much better. My dear, this is just what is so annoying about love: the man's is always going slower and slower towards a dead stop, as the woman's is \"coaling\" and getting steam up. I borrow papa's admirably accurate metaphor: nothing can be truer. It is a great pity, but I suppose the fault is Nature's. _Entre nous_, I don't think Nature ever contemplated marriage, any more than she did crinolettes, pearl powder, or the electric light. There is no doubt that Nature intended to adjust the thing on the butterfly and buttercup system,--on the _je reste, tu t'en vas_ principle. And nothing would be easier or nicer, only there are children and property. So the butterfly has to be pinned down by the buttercup. That is why the Communists and Anarchists always abolish Property and Marriage together. The one is evolved out of the other, just as the dear scientists say the horse was evolved out of a bird, which I never can see makes the matter any easier of comprehension; but, still--what was I saying? Oh, I meant to say this: you are only lamenting, as a special defalcation and disloyalty in San Zenone, what is merely his unconscious and involuntary and perfectly natural alteration from a lover into a husband. The butterfly is beginning to feel the pin which has been run through him to stick him down. It is not your fault, my sweet little girl; it is the fault, if at all, of the world, which has decreed that the butterfly, to flirt legitimately with the buttercup, must suffer the corking-pin. Now, take my advice: the pin is in, don't worry if he writhe on it a little bit! It is only what the beloved scientists again call automatic action. And do try and beat into your little head the fact that a man may love you very dearly, and yet yawn a little for the _petits thtres_ in the silent recesses of his manly breast. Of course I know this sort of rough awakening from delightful dreams is harder for you than it is for most, because you began at such tremendous altitudes. You had your Ruy Blas and Petrarca and the mandoline and the moonlight and the love-philtres all mixed up in an intoxicating draught. You have naturally a great deal more disillusion to go through than if you had married a country squire or a Scotch laird, who would never have suggested any romantic delights. One cannot go near heaven without coming down with a crash, like the poor men in the balloons. You have been up in your balloon, and you are now coming down. Ah, my dear, everything depends on _how_ you come down! You will think me a monster for saying so, but it will rest so much in your own hands. You won't believe it, but it will. If you come down with tact and good humor, it will all be right afterwards; but if you show temper, as men say of their horses, why, then the balloon will lie prone, a torn, empty, useless bag, that will never again get off the ground. To speak plainly, dear, if you will receive with resignation and sweetness the unpleasant discovery that San Zenone is mortal, you won't be unhappy, and you will soon get used to it; but if you perpetually fret about it you won't alter him, and you will both be miserable; or, if not miserable, you will do something worse; you will each find your amusement in somebody else. I know you so well, my poor, pretty Gladys; you want such an immense quantity of sympathy and affection; but you won't get it, my dear child. I quite understand that the prince looks like a picture, and he has made life an erotic poem for you for a month, and the inevitable reaction which follows seems dull as ditch-water, you would even say as cruel as the grave. But it is _nothing new_. Do try and get that well in your mind. Try, too, and be as light-hearted as you can. Men hate an unamusable woman. Make believe to laugh at the _petits thtres_ if you can't really do it: if you don't, dear, he will go to somebody else who will. Why do those _demi-monde_ women get such preference over us? Only because they don't bore their men. A man would sooner we flung a champagne-glass at his head than cried for five minutes. We can't fling champagne-glasses: the prejudices of our education are against it. It is an immense loss to us; we must make up for it as much as we can by being as agreeable as we know how to be. We shall always be a dozen lengths behind those others. By the way, you said in one of your earliest notes that you wondered why our mother ever married. I am not sufficiently _au courant_ with pre-historic times to be able to tell you why, but I can see what she has done since she did marry. She has always effaced herself in the very wisest and most prudent manner. She has never begrudged papa his Norway fishing or his August yachting, though she knew he could ill afford them. She has never bored him _with_ herself, or _about_ us. She has constantly urged him to go away and enjoy himself, and when he is down with her in the country she always takes care that all the women he admires and all the men who best amuse him shall be invited in relays, to prevent his being dull or feeling teased for a moment. I am quite sure she has never cared the least about her own wishes, but has only studied his. This is what I call being a clever woman and a good woman. But I fear such women are as rare as blue roses. Try and be like her, my dear. She was quite as young as you are now when she married. But, unfortunately, in truth, you are a terrible little egotist. You want to shut up this poor young man all alone with you in a kind of attitude of perpetual adoration--of yourself. That is what women call affection: you are not alone in your ideas. Some men submit to this sort of demand, and go about forever held tight in a leash, like unslipped pointers. The majority--well, the majority bolt. And I am sure I should if I were one of them. I do not think you could complain if your beautiful Romeo did. I can see you so exactly, with your pretty little grave face, and your eyes that have such a fatal aptitude for tears, and your solemn little views about matrimony and its responsibilities, making yourself quite odious to this mirthful Apollo of yours, and innocently believing all the while that you are pleasing Heaven and saving your own dignity by being so remarkably unpleasant! Are you _very_ angry with me? I am afraid so. Myself, I would much sooner have an unfaithful man than a dull one: the one may be bored _by_ you, but the other bores _you_, which is immeasurably worse.         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Princess di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset, to the Lady Gwendolen Chichester, St. Petersburg._  DEAR GWEN,--  How can you _possibly_ tell what mamma did when she was young? I dare say she fretted dreadfully. Now, of course, she has got used to it,--like all other miserable women. If people marry only to long to be with other people, what is the use of being married at all? I said so to Piero, and he answered, very insolently, \"_Il n'y a point! Si on le savait._\" He sent for some more dreadful French books, Gyp's, and Richepin's, and Gui de Maupassant's, and he lies about reading them all day long when he isn't asleep. He is very often asleep in the daytime. He apologizes when he is found out, but he yawns as he does so. You say I should amuse him; but I _can't_ amuse him. He doesn't care for any English news, and he is beginning to get irritable because I cannot talk to him in Italian, and he declares my French detestable, and there is always something dreadful happening. There has been such a terrible scene in the village. Four of the Coombe-Bysset men, two blacksmiths, a carpenter, and a laborer, have ducked Toniello in the village pond on account of his attention to their women-kind; and Toniello, when he staggered out of the weeds and the slime, drew his knife on them and stabbed two very badly. Of course he has been taken up by the constables, and the men he hurt moved to the county hospital. The magistrates are furious and scandalized; and Piero!--Piero has nobody to play billiards with him. When the magistrates interrogated him about Toniello, as, of course, they were obliged to do, he got into a dreadful passion because one of them said that it was just like a cowardly Italian to carry a knife and make use of it. Piero absolutely _hissed_ at the solemn old gentleman who mumbled this. \"And your people,\" he cried, \"are they so very courageous? Is it better to beat a man into a jelly, or kick a woman with nailed boots, as your English mob does? Where is there anything cowardly? He was one against four. In my country there is not a night that goes without a _rissa_ of that sort; but nobody takes any notice. The jealous persons are left to fight it out as best they may. After all, it is the women's fault.\" And then he said some things that really I cannot repeat; and it was a mercy that, as he spoke in the most rapid and furious French, the old gentleman did not, I think, understand a syllable. But they saw he was in a passion, and that scandalized them, because, you know, English people always think that you should keep your bad temper for your own people at home. Meantime, of course, Toniello is in prison, and I am afraid they won't let us take him out on bail, because he has hurt one of the blacksmiths dreadfully. Aunt Carry's solicitors are doing what they can for him, to please me; but I can see they consider it all _peines perdues_ for a rogue who ought to be hanged. \"And to think,\" cries Toniello, \"that in my own country I should have all the _populo_ with me! The very carabineers themselves would have been with me! _Accidente a tutti quei grulli!_\" which means, \"May apoplexy seize these fools!\" \"They were only the women's husbands,\" he adds, with scorn: \"they are well worth making a fuss about, certainly!\" Then Piero consoles him, and gives him cigarettes, and is obliged to leave him sobbing and tearing his hair, and lying face downward on his bed of sacking. I thought Piero would not leave the poor fellow alone in prison, and so I supposed he would give up all idea of going from here; and so I began to say to myself, \"_A quelque chose malheur est bon._\" But to-day, at luncheon, Piero said, \"_Sai, carina!_ It was bad enough with Toniello, but without him, I tell you frankly, I cannot stand any more of it. With Toniello, one could laugh and forget a little. But now--_anima mia_, if you do not wish me to kill somebody, and be lodged beside Toniello by your worthy law-givers, you must really let me go to Trouville.\" \"Alone!\" I said; and I believe it is what he did mean, only the horror in my voice frightened him from confessing it. He sighed and got up. \"I suppose I shall never be alone any more,\" he said, impatiently. \"If only men knew what they do when they marry, _on ne nous prendrait jamais_. No, no. Of course I meant that you must consent to come away with me somewhere out of this intolerable place, which is made up of fog and green leaves. Let us go to Paris, to begin with: there is not a soul there, and the theatres are _en relche_; but it is always delightful, and then, in a week or so, we will go down to Trouville: all the world is there.\" I couldn't answer him for crying. Perhaps that was best, for I am sure I should have said something wicked, which might have divided us forever. And then what would people have thought?         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Lady Gwendolen Chichester, St. Petersburg, to the Princess di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset._  MY POOR LITTLE DEAR,--  Are you already beginning to be miserable about what people will think? Then, indeed, your days of joy are numbered. If I were to write to you fifty times, I could only repeat what I have always written. You are not wise, and you are doing everything you ought not to do. _Of two people who are married, there is always one who has the delusion that he or she is necessary and delightful to the life of the other. The other generally thinks just the contrary._ The result is not peace. This gay, charming, handsome son of Rome has become your entire world; but don't suppose for a moment, my child, that you will ever be his. It is not in reason, not in nature, that you should be. _If_ you have the intelligence, the tact, and the forbearance required, you _may_ become his friend and counsellor; but I fear you never will have these. You fret, you weep, and you understand nothing of the masculine temperament. \"I see snakes,\" as the Americans observe; and you will not have either the coolness or the wisdom required to scotch a snake, much less to kill it. Once for all, my poor pet, go cheerfully to Paris, Trouville, and all the pleasure-places in the world. Affect enjoyment if you feel it not, and try to remember, beyond everything, that affection is not to be retained or revived by either coercion or lamentation. Once dead, it is not to be awakened by all the \"crooning\" of its mourner. It is a corpse for ever and aye. Myself, I fail to see how you could expect a young Italian, who has all the habits of the great world and the memories of his _vie de garon_, to be cheerful or contented in a wet June in an isolated English country house, with nobody to look at but yourself. Believe me, my dear child, it is the inordinate vanity of a woman which makes her imagine that she can be sufficient for her husband. Nothing but vanity. The cleverer a woman is, the more fully she recognizes her own insufficiency for the amusement of a man, and the more carefully (if she be wise) does she take care that this deficiency in her shall never be forced upon his observation. Now, if you shut a man up with you in a country house, with the rain raining every day, as in Longfellow's poem, you do force it upon him most conspicuously. If you were not his wife, I dare say he would not tire of you, and he might even prefer a gray sky to a blue one. But as his wife!--oh, my dear, why, why don't you try and understand what a terrible penalty-weight you carry in the race? Write and tell me all about it. I shall be anxious. I am so afraid, my sweet little sister, that you think love is all moonlight and kisses, and forget that there are clouds in the sky and quarrels on earth. May heaven save you from both! P.S.--Do remember that this same love requires just as delicate handling as a cobweb does: if a rough touch break the cobweb, all the artists in the world can't mend it. There is a truth for you. If you prevent his going to Paris now, he will go in six months' time, and perhaps he will go without you. Perhaps he would be happier at Lanciano than at Coombe, and he would have all his own people; but he would want the _petits thtres_ all the same. You are not wise, my poor pet; you should make him feel that you are one with his pleasures, not, that you and his pleasures are enemies. But it is no use to instil wisdom into you: you are very young, and very much in love. You look on all the natural distractions which he inclines to as so many rivals. So they may be; but _we don't beat our rivals by abusing them_. The really wise way is to tacitly show that we can be more attractive than they: if we cannot be so, we may sulk or sigh as we will, we shall be vanquished by them. You will think me very preachy-preachy, and perhaps you will throw me in the fire unread; but I must say just this much more. Dear, you are in love with Love, but underneath Love there is a real man, and real men are far from ideal creatures. Now, it is the real man that you want to consider, to humor, to study. If the real man be pleased, Love will take care of himself; whereas, if you bore the real man, Love will fly away. If you had been wise, my poor pet, I repeat, you would have found nothing so delightful as Judic and Chaumont, and you would have declared that the asphalt excelled all the Alps in the world. He does not love you the less because he wants to be _dans le mouvement_, to hear what other men are saying, and to smoke his cigar among his fellow-creatures.         *       *       *       *       *  _From, the Duchessa dell'Aquila Fulva, Htel des Roches Noires, Trouville, France, to the Principe di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset, Luton, Bedfordshire, England._  Poor flower, in your box of wet moss, what has become of you? Are you dead, and dried in your wife's _hortus siccus_? She would be quite sure of you _then_, and I dare say much happier than if you were set forth in anybody else's bouquet. I try in vain to imagine you in that \"perfectly proper\" _milieu_ (is not that correct English, \"perfectly proper\"?). Will you be dreadfully changed when one sees you again? There is a French proverb which says that \"the years of joy count double.\" The days of _ennui_ certainly count for years, and give us gray hairs before we are five-and-twenty. But you know I cannot pity you. You _would_ marry an English girl because she looked pretty sipping her tea. I told you beforehand that you would be miserable with her, once shut up in the country. The episode of Toniello is enchanting. What people!--to put him in prison for a little bit of _chiasso_ like that! You should never have taken his bright eyes and his mandoline to that doleful and damp land of precisians. What will they do with him? And what can you do without him? The weather here is admirable. There are numbers of people one knows. It is really very amusing. I go and dance every night, and then we play,--usually \"bac,\" or roulette. Everybody is very merry. We all talk often of you, and say the _De Profundis_ over you, my poor Piero. Why did your cruel destiny make you see a _Sainte-Nitouche_ drinking tea under a lime-tree? I suppose _Sainte-Nitouche_ would not permit it, else why not exchange the humid greenness of your matrimonial prison for the Rue des Planches and the Casino?         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Prince di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset, to the Duchessa dell'Aquila Fulva, Trouville._  _Carissima mia_,--  I have set light to the fuse! I have frankly declared that if I do not go out of this watery atmosphere and verdant Bastile I shall perish of sheer inanition and exhaustion. The effect of the declaration was for the moment such that I hoped, actually hoped, that she was going to get into a passion. It would have been so refreshing! After twenty-six days of dumb acquiescence and silent tears, it would have been positively delightful to have had a storm. But no! For an instant she looked at me with unspeakable reproach; the next her dove's eyes filled, she sighed, she left the room! Do they not say that feather beds offer an admirable defence against bullets? I feel like the bullet which has been fired into the feather bed. The feather bed is victorious. I see the Rue des Planches through the perspective of the watery atmosphere; the Casino seems to smile at me from the end of the interminable lime-tree avenue, which is one of the chief beauties of this house; but, alas! they are both as far off as if Trouville were in the moon. What could they do to me if I came alone? Do you know what they could do? I have not the remotest idea, but I imagine something frightful. They shut up their public-houses by force, and their dancing-places. Perhaps they would shut up me. In England they have a great belief in creating virtue by Act of Parliament. In myself this enforced virtue creates such a revolt that I shall _tirer sur le mors_, and fly before very long. The admired excellence of this beautiful estate is that it lies in a ring-fence. I feel that I shall take a leap over that ring-fence. Do not mistake me, _cara mia Teresina_, I am exceedingly fond of my wife. I think her quite lovely, simple, saintly, and truly woman-like. She is exquisitely pretty, and entirely without vanity, and I am certain she is immeasurably my superior morally, and possibly mentally too. But--there is always such a long and melancholy \"but\" attached to marriage--she does not amuse me in the least. She is always the same. She is shocked at nearly everything that is natural or diverting. She thinks me unmanly because I dislike rain. She buttons about her a hideous, straight, water-proof garment, and walks out in a deluge. She blushes if I try to make her laugh at \"Figaro,\" and she goes out of the room when I mention Trouville. What am I to do with a woman like this? It is an admirable type, no doubt. Possibly, if she had not shut me up in a country house in a wet June, with the thermometer at 10 R., and the barometer fixedly at the word _Rainy_, I might have been always charmed with this St. Dorothea-like attitude and never have found out the monotony of it. But, as it is, I yawn till I dislocate my neck. She thinks me a heathen already. I am convinced that very soon she will think me a brute. And I am neither. I only want to get out, like the bird in the cage. It is a worn simile, but it is such a true one.         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Duchessa dell'Aquila Fulva, Roches Noires, Trouville, to the Prince di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset._  _Piero mio_,--  In marriage, the male bird is always wanting to get out when the female bird does not want him to get out; also, she is forever tightening the wires over his head, and declaring that nothing can be more delightful than the perch which she sits on herself. Come to us here. There are any quantities of birds here who ought to be in their cages, but are not, and manage to enjoy themselves _quand mme_. If only you had married Nicoletta! She might have torn your hair occasionally, but she would never have bored you. There is only one supreme art necessary for a woman: it is to thoroughly understand that she must never be a _seccatura_. A woman may be beautiful, admirable, a paragon of virtue, a marvel of intellect; but if she be a _seccatura--addio_! Whereas, she may be plain, small, nothing to look at in any way, and a very monster of sins, big and little; but if she know how to amuse your dull sex, she is mistress of you all. It is evident that this great art is not studied at Coombe-Bysset.         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Princess di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset, to the Lady Gwendolen Chichester, St. Petersburg._  OH, MY DEAR GWEN,--  It is too dreadful, and I am so utterly wretched! I cannot tell you what I feel. He is quite determined to go to Trouville by Paris at once, and just now it is such exquisite weather. It has only rained three times this week, and the whole place is literally a bower of roses of every kind. He has been very restless the last few days, and at last, yesterday, after dinner, he said straight out that he had had enough of Coombe, and he thought we might be seen at Homburg or Trouville next week. And he pretended to want every kind of thing that is to be bought at Paris and nowhere else. Paris!--when we have been together just twenty-nine days to-day! Paris!--I don't know why, but I feel as if it would be the end of everything. Paris!--we shall dine at restaurants; we shall stay at the Windsor; we shall go to theatres; he will be at his club, he belongs to the Petit Cercle and the Mirliton; we shall be just like anybody else,--just like all the million-and-one married people who are always in a crowd. To take one's new-born happiness to an hotel! It is as profane as it would be to say your prayers on the top of a drag. To me, it is quite horrible. And it will be put in \"Galignani\" directly, of course, that the \"Prince and Princess San Zenone have arrived at the Htel Bristol.\" And then all the pretty women who tried to flirt with him before will laugh and say, \"There, you see, she has bored him already!\" Everybody will say so, for they all know I wished to spend the whole summer at Coombe. If he would only go to his own country, I would not say a word. I am really longing to see his people, and his palaces, and the wonderful gardens, with their statues and their ilex woods, and the temples that are as old as the days of Augustus, and the fire-flies, and the magnolia-groves, and the peasants who are always singing; but he won't go there. He says it is a _seccatura_. Everything is a _seccatura_. He only likes places where he can meet all the world. \"Paris will be a solitude too, never fear,\" he said, very petulantly; \"for there will be all the _petits thtres_, and the open-air concerts, and we can dine in the Bois and down the river, and we can run to Trouville. It will be better than rain, rain, rain, and nothing to look at except your amiable aunt's big horses and big trees. I adore horses, and trees are not bad if they are planted away from the house, but, viewed as eternal companions, one may have too much of them.\" And I am his eternal companion; but it seems already I don't count! I have not said anything. I know one oughtn't. But Piero saw how it vexed me, and it made him cross. \"_Cara mia_,\" he said, \"why did you not tell me before we married that you intended me to be buried forever in a box under wet leaves, like a rose that is being sent to the market? I should have known what to expect; and I do not like wet leaves.\" I could not help reminding him that he had been ever, ever so anxious to come to Coombe. Then he laughed; but he was very cross, too. \"Could I tell, _anima mia_,\" he cried, \"that Coombe was situated in a succession of lagoons, contains not one single French novel, is fifteen miles asunder from its own railway-station, and is blessed with a population of day-laborers? What man have I seen since I have been here, except your parish priest, who mumbles, wears spectacles, and tries to give me a tract against the Holy Father? In this country you do not know what it is to be warm. You do not know what sunshine is like. You take an umbrella when you go in the garden. You put on a water-proof to go and hear one little, shivering nightingale sing in a wet elder-bush. I tell you I am tired of your country, absolutely tired. You are an angel; no doubt you are an angel; but you cannot console me for the intolerable emptiness of this intolerable life, where there is nothing on earth to do but to eat, drink, and sleep, and drive in a dog-cart.\" All this he said in one breath, in a flash of forked lightning, as it were. Now that I write it down, it does not seem so very dreadful; but as he, with the most fiery scorn, the most contemptuous passion, said it, I assure you it was terrible. It revealed, just as the flash of lightning would show a gravel-pit, how fearfully bored he has been all the time I thought he was happy.         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Lady Gwendolen Chichester, St. Petersburg, to the Princess di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset._  Men are very easily bored, my dear, if they have any brains. It is only the dull ones who are not.         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Princess di San Zenone to the Lady Gwendolen Chichester._  If I believed what your cynical letter says, I should leave him to-morrow. I would never live through a succession of disillusions and of insults.         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Lady Gwendolen Chichester to the Princess di San Zenone._  Where are your principles? Where are your duties? My dear little girl, you have married him; you must submit to him as he is. Marriages wouldn't last two days if just because the man yawned the woman ran away. Men always yawn. Hitherto, all San Zenone's faults appear to consist in the very pardonable fact that, being an Italian, he is not alive to the charms of bucolic England in rainy weather, and that, being a young man, he wants to see his Paris again. Neither of these seem to me irreparable crimes. Go to Paris and try to enjoy yourself. After all, if his profile be so beautiful, you ought to be sufficiently happy in gazing at it from the back of a _baignoir_. I grant that it is not the highest amatory ideal,--to rush about the boulevards in a daument, and eat delicious little dinners in the cafs, and laugh at Judic or Chaumont afterwards; but _l'amour peut se nicher_ anywhere. And Love won't be any the worse for having his digestion studied by good cooks, and his possible _ennui_ exorcised by good players. You see for yourself that the great passion yawns after a time. Turn back to what you call my cynical letter, and re-read my remarks upon Nature. By the way, I entirely deny that they are cynical. On the contrary, I inculcate on you patience, sweetness of temper, and adaptability to circumstances,--three most amiable qualities. If I were a cynic, I should say to you that Marriage is a Mistake, and two capital letters could hardly emphasize this melancholy truth sufficiently. But, as there are men and women, and, as I before observed, property, in the world, nothing better for the consolidation of rents and freeholds has, as yet, been discovered. I dare say Krapotkine in his prison could devise something better; but they are afraid of him. So we all jog on in the old routine, vaguely conscious that we are all blunderers, but indisposed for such a drastic remedy as would alone cure us. Just you remark to any lawyer that marriage is a mistake, as I have said before, and see what answer you will get. He will certainly reply to you that there is no other way of securing the transmission of property safely. I confess that this view of wealth makes me, for one, a most desperate Radical. Only think, if there were no property, we should all be frisking about in our happy valleys as free and as merry as little kids. I shouldn't now be obliged to put on all my war-paint and beads, like a savage, and go out to a dreadful court dinner, four hours long, because George has a \"career\" and thinks my suffering advances it. Oh, you happy child, to have nothing worse to do than to rattle down the Bois in a _milord_, and sup off a _matelote_ by the lake with your Romeo!         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Princess di San Zenone, Coombe-Bysset, to the Lady Gwendolen Chichester, St. Petersburg._  We are to leave for Paris and Trouville to-morrow. I have yielded, as you and mamma seemed to think it was my _duty_ to do. But my life is over. I shall say farewell to all happiness when the gates of Coombe-Bysset close upon me. Henceforth we shall be like everybody else. However, you cannot reproach me any longer with being selfish, nor can he. There is a great friend of his, the Duchess of Aquila Fulva, at Trouville. She writes to him very often, I know. He never offers to show me her letters. _I believe the choice of Trouville is her doing._ Write to me at Paris, at The Windsor.         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Lady Gwendolen Chichester, St. Petersburg, to the Princess di San Zenone, Htel Windsor, Paris._  MY POOR CHILD!--  Has the green-eyed monster already invaded your gentle soul because he doesn't show you his own letters? My dear, no man who was not born a _our_ would show a woman's letters to his wife. Surely you wish your hero to know the A, B, C of gentle manners! I am delighted you are going into the world; but if you only go as \"a duty\" I am afraid the results won't be sunshiny. \"Duty\" is such a _very_ disagreeable thing. It always rolls itself up like a hedgehog, with all its prickles out, turning forever round and round on the axle of its own self-admiration. If you go to Trouville, and wherever else you do go, _en martyr_, my dear, you will give the mischievous duchess, if she be mischievous, a terrible advantage over you at starting. If you mean to be silent, unpleasant, and enwrapped in a gloomy contemplation of your own merits and wrongs, don't blame _him_ if he spend his time at the Casino with his friend, or somebody worse. I am quite sure you _mean_ to be unselfish, and you fancy you are so, and all the rest of it, quite honestly; but, in real truth, as I told you before, you are only an egotist. You would rather keep this unhappy Piero on thorns beside you than see him enjoy himself with other people. Now, I call that shockingly selfish; and if you go in that spirit to Trouville he will soon begin to wish, my dear child, that he had never had a fancy to come over to a London season. I can see you so exactly! Too dignified to be cross, too offended to be companionable; silent, reproachful, terrible!         *       *       *       *       *  _From the Lady Mary Bruton, Roches Noires, Trouville, to Mrs. D'Arcy, British Embassy, Berlin._  July 15th.  ... Among the new arrivals here are the San Zenone. You remember my telling you of their marriage some six weeks ago. It was quite _the_ marriage of the season. They really were immensely in love with each other, but that stupid month down in the country has done its usual work. In a rainy June, too! Of course any poor Amorina would emerge from his captivity bedraggled, dripping, and disenchanted. She is really very pretty,--quite lovely, indeed,--but she looks fretful and dull; her handsome husband, on the contrary, is as gay as a lark which has found the door of its cage wide open one morning. There is here a great friend of his, a Duchessa dell'Aquila Fulva. _She_ is very gay too; she is always perfectly dressed, and chattering from morning to night in shrill Italian or voluble French. She is the cynosure of all eyes as she goes to swim in a rose-colored _maillot_, with an orange-and-gold Eastern burnous flung about her artistically. She has that wonderful Venetian coloring which can stand a contrast and glow of color which would simply kill any other woman. She is very tall, and magnificently made, and yet uncommonly graceful. Last night she was persuaded to dance a _salterello_ with San Zenone at the Maison Persane, and it was marvellous. They are both such handsome people, and threw such wonderful _brio_, as they would call it, into the affair. The poor little, pretty princess, looking as fair and as dull as a primrose in a shower, sat looking on dismally. Stupid little thing!--as if _that_ would do her any good! A few days ago Lord Hampshire arrived off here in his yacht. He was present at the _salterello_, and as I saw him out in the gardens afterwards with the neglected one, sitting beside her in the moonlight, I presume he was offering her sympathy and consolation. He is a heavy young fellow, but exceedingly good-humored and kind-hearted. _He_ would have been in heaven in the wet June at Coombe-Bysset; but she refused him, silly little thing! I am quite angry with her: she has had her own way, and she won't make the best of that. I met her and her rejected admirer riding together this morning towards Villerville, while the beautiful prince was splashing about in the water with his Venetian friend. I see a great many eventual complications ahead. Well, they will all be the fault of that Rainy June!\n\n"

Is there any sensation equal to that produced by the first lover and the first proposal coming to a girl in a large family of girls? It is delightfully sentimental, comical, complimentary, affronting, rousing, tiresome--all in one. It is a herald of lovers, proposals, and wonderful changes all round. It is the first thrill of real life in its strong passions, grave vicissitudes, and big joys and sorrows as they come in contact with idle fancies, hearts that have been light, simple experiences which have hitherto been carefully guarded from rude shocks.  It does not signify much whether the family of girls happen to be rich or poor, unless indeed that early and sharp poverty causes a precocity which deepens girls' characters betimes, and by making them sooner women, robs them of a certain amount of the thoughtlessness, fearlessness, and impracticability of girlhood. But girlhood, like many another natural condition, dies hard; and its sweet, bright illusions, its wisdom and its folly, survive tolerably severe pinches of adversity.  The younger members of such a sisterhood are politely supposed to be kept in safe ignorance of the great event which is befalling one of the seniors. It is thought at once a delicate and prudent precaution to prevent the veil which hides the future, with its casualties, from being lifted prematurely and abruptly, where juvenile minds are concerned, lest they become unhinged and unfit for the salutary discipline of schoolroom lessons, and the mild pleasure of schoolroom treats. The flower in the bud ought to be kept with its petals folded, in its innocent absence of self-consciousness, to the last moment.  But there is an electric sympathy in the air which defeats precautions. There is a freemasonry of dawning womanhood which starts into life everywhere. How do the young people pick up with such surprising quickness and acuteness the looks and whispers meant to pass over their heads, the merry glances, nervous shrugs, quick blushes, and indignant pouts, which have suddenly grown strangely prevalent in the blooming circle? The bystanders are understood to be engrossed with their music-lessons, their drawing-classes, their rudimentary Latin and Greek--if anybody is going in for the higher education of women--their pets, their games of lawn-tennis, their girl companions with whom these other girls are for ever making appointments to walk, to practise part-singing, to work or read together, to get up drawing-room _tableaux_ or plays.  The general consciousness is not, in certain lights, favourable to a lover's pretensions. For human nature is perverse, and there is such a thing as _esprit-de-corps_ running to excess. There may be a due amount of girlish pride in knowing that one of the sisters has inspired a grand passion. There may be a tremulous respect for the fact that she has passed the Rubicon, that, in place of girlish trifling, she has an affair which has to do with the happiness or misery of a fellow creature, not to say with her own happiness or misery, on her burdened mind. Why, if she does not take care, she may be plunged at once, first into the whirl of choosing her trousseau and the fascinating trial of being the principal figure at a wedding, and then involved in the tremendous responsibilities of housekeeping, butchers' bills, grocers' bills, cooks' delinquencies, with the heavy obligations--not only of ordering dinners for two, but of occasionally entertaining a room full of company, single-handed!  And this is only one side of the shield; there is a reverse side, at least equally prominent and alarming. The second side upholds maidenly claims, finds nothing good enough to match with them, and is tempted to scout and flout, laugh and mock at the rival claims of the lover upon trial. This is true even in the most innocent of dove-cots, where satire is still as playful and harmless as summer lightning.  \"The idea of Tom Robinson's thinking of one of us!\" cried Annie Millar. \"What could possess him to imagine that we should ever get over the shop--granted that it is a Brobdingnagian shop, an imposing mart of linen-drapery, haberdashery, silk-mercery enough to serve the whole county?\"  \"To be sure it is only Dora, not you, Annie,\" burst in eighteen years' old Rose, who had just left school, and was fain to drop the pretence of being too young to notice the most interesting event in the world to a family of girls.  \"Why do you say that, Rose? Dora may not be so pretty as Annie--I don't know, and I don't care--it is all a matter of taste; but she is as much one of us, father's daughter, brought up like the rest of us in the Old Doctor's House.\"  The speaker was May, between sixteen and seventeen. She was the tallest of the four sisters--let them call her \"Little May\" as long as they liked. She had so far forgotten herself as to follow Rose's lead.  \"Hold your tongues, you two monkeys; what should you know about it?\" Annie, who had a tendency to sit upon her younger sisters, tried to silence them. She had reached the advanced age of twenty-two, and by virtue of being the eldest, had been considered grown up for the last four years, when Rose and May were chits of fourteen and a little over twelve. Of course this gave Annie a vast advantage in womanly dignity and knowledge of the world. But at the present moment she was herself so interested in the discussion that she could not make up her mind to drop it till Rose and May were out of the way.  \"I must say\"--Annie started the subject again--\"that I think it great presumption in Tom Robinson, though he is not so ugly as that comes to, and he's really well enough bred in spite of 'Robinson's.'\"  \"He is a college-bred man.\" Dora ventured shyly to put in a word for the dignity of her suitor, and for her own dignity as so far involved in his. \"And so were his father and grandfather before him, father says.\"  \"But the Robinsons had the silk-mill and the woollen-factory then as well as the big shop,\" corrected Annie. \"And Tom might have gone into the Church or into some other profession if he had chosen, when things might have been a little different. Still, if you are pleased, Dora,\" with a peal of derisive laughter, \"if you do not object to the--shop.\"  \"Of course I object,\" cried Dora, tingling with mortification and shame. \"That is, I should object to his having a shop, if I had ever thought of him for a single moment in that light. I cannot imagine what put me into his head--in that sense. Indeed I cannot believe it yet. I am sure it is just some nonsense on the part of the rest of you to tease me.\"  \"No, no,\" Annie hastened to contradict her. \"It is sober reality. He has said something to father; you know he has, mother owned it.\"  \"He has been meeting us and throwing himself in our way everywhere,\" broke in the irrepressible Rose and May.  \"He has been coming and coming here,\" resumed Annie, \"where, as we don't happen to have a brother, there is not even another young man to form an excuse for his coming. We cannot so much as pretend, when people remark on his visits, that he has come ever since we remember, and is as familiar with us as we are with ourselves. No doubt, in a little town like this, everybody who has the least claim to be a gentleman or a lady, knows every other gentleman or lady--after a fashion. But naturally father and mother were not intimate with the late Mr. and Mrs. Robinson; and we--that is, Tom and we girls--are not so near each other in age as to have been brought together by our respective nurses. We did not pick daisies in company, or else pull each other's hair, and slap each other's faces, according to our varying moods. Tom Robinson is four or five years older than I, not to speak of Dora.\"  \"He stopped us this very morning,\" Rose again joined in the chorus, \"when May and I were going with the Hewetts to gather primroses in Parson's Meadow. He asked if our sisters--that was you, Dora, with Annie thrown into the bargain--thought of going on the river this afternoon.\"  \"He might be an inch or two taller, I don't suppose he is above five feet six or seven,\" suggested Annie, maliciously recalling a detail in the description of Dora's future husband, that be he who or what he might, he should certainly not be under six feet in height. Dora, who was herself considerably below the middle size, would never yield her freedom to a man who had to admit a lower scale of inches.  \"And his hair might be a little less--chestnut, shall we say, Dora?\" put in Rose with exasperating sprightliness, referring to a former well-known prejudice of Dora's against \"_Judas-tinted hair_.\"  \"Would you call his nose Roman or Grecian?\" asked May navely, of a very nondescript feature.  \"And he has so little to say for himself,\" recommenced Annie, \"though when he does speak there is no great fault to be found with what he says; still it would be dreadfully dull and tiresome to have to do all the speaking for a silent partner.\"  \"Oh, hold your tongues, you wretched girls,\" cried Dora, standing at bay, stamping one small foot in a slipper with a preposterously large rosette. \"What does it signify? The man, like his words, is well enough--better than any of us, I dare say,\" speaking indignantly; \"but what does it matter, when I could never look at him, never dream of him, as anything more than a mere acquaintance? I don't wish for a lover or a husband--at least not yet,\" with a gasp; \"I don't wish to leave home, and go away from all of you, though you are so unkind and teasing--not for a long, long time, till I am quite a middle-aged woman. I don't see why I should be plagued about it when Annie here, who is two years older than I am, and ever so much prettier, as everybody knows, has escaped such persecution.\"  \"My dear,\" said Annie demurely, \"it is because you have the opportunity of presenting me with a pair of green garters. If it should occur again, and you choose to avail yourself of it, I mean to accept the garters with the best grace in the world. Isn't that good of me when you have been coolly telling me that I have been overlooked as the eldest, and the belle of the family--flattering my conceit with one breath and taking it down with another? But it is not a case of Leah and Rachel. We are not in the East, and in the West the elder sister does not necessarily take precedence in marriage. You are quite welcome to marry first, Dora; you are all welcome to marry before me, girls,\" with a sweeping curtsey to her audience all round. \"I am perfectly resigned to your leaving your poor worthy elder sister to end her days as a solitary spinster, a meek and useful maiden-aunt.\"  The Millars were the daughters of Dr. Millar of Redcross, an old-fashioned country town in the Midlands. They were happy in having a good father and mother still spared to them. The girls were what is called \"a fine family,\" in a stronger sense than that in which Jane Austen has used the term. Their ages ranged from twenty-two to midway between sixteen and seventeen. They were all good-looking girls, with a family likeness. Annie, the eldest, was very pretty, with delicate, regular features, a soft warm brunette colour, dark eyes, and a small brown head and graceful throat, like the head and throat of a greyhound.  Dora, the first wooed, was, at a hasty glance, a mere shadow of Annie. She was pale, though it was a healthy paleness. Her hair was lighter in tint, her eyes, too, were considerably lighter--granted that they were clear as crystal. It was difficult to think of Dora as preferred before Annie, if one did not take into account that there are people who will turn away from June roses to gather a cluster of honeysuckle, or pick a sweet pea--people to whom there is an ineffable charm in simple maidenliness and sweetness. Dora's modest unhesitating acceptance of the second part in the family and social circle, and her perfect content to play it, would be a crowning attraction in such people's eyes. So would her gentle girlish diffidence, which moved her rather to meet and reflect the tastes and opinions of others than to exercise her own, though she was by no means without individual capacity and character.  Rose was the least handsome of the family at this stage of her existence. The family features in her had taken a slightly bizarre cast, and she had a bad habit of wrinkling her smooth low forehead and crumpling up her sharpish nose, in a manner which accentuated the peculiarity. But Annie, who was an authority on the subject of looks, maintained, behind Rose's back, that there was something _piquante_ and _recherche_ about Rose's face and figure. Not one of the Millars was tall--not even May, though she came nearest to it; but Rose's slight pliant figure had a natural grace and elegance which its quick, careless movements did not dispel. When she held herself up, uncreased her forehead and nose, showed to advantage her very fine, true chestnut hair, and was full of animation--as to do Rose justice she generally was--giving fair play to her dimples and little white teeth, Annie said Rose had a style of her own which did no discredit to the family reputation for more than a fair share of beauty. In addition to Annie's high spirit and ready tongue, Rose had a decided turn for art, which her father had taken pride in cultivating.  \"Little May\" was like Annie, and promised to be as pretty; but she was a rose in the bud still, with the unfilled out outlines and crude angularities of a girl not done growing. She was very much of a child in many things, and she had Dora's soft clinging nature, yet under it all she was the born scholar of the family, with a simple aptitude and taste for learning which surprised and delighted her father still more than Rose's achievements in pastilles and water-colours pleased him. It was seeing May at her books, when she was a very different May from the girl who ran about with Rose, and was kept in her proper place by Annie, which revived in Doctor Millar the old regret that Providence had not blessed him with a son. He could not exactly make a son of May, since from her early childhood she was a little sensitive woman all over, but he did what he could. He had her taught Latin, Greek, and mathematics just to afford her the chance of being a scholar. He never told himself, and nobody else did, in the meantime, what she was to do with her scholarship when she was a little older. Whether it was merely to grace her womanhood, or whether the youngest of the family, her father and mother's last pet, was to summon up courage, tear herself away from familiar and dear surroundings, and carry her gifts and acquirements out into the world, in order to win for them the best distinction of usefulness.  Dora's lightly held suitor was the head of \"Robinson's.\" \"Robinson's\" was a great and time-honoured institution in Redcross, while it and its masters were somewhat of anomalies. The first Robinson whom the town troubled to remember was as good as anybody in it, the proprietor of a silk-mill, and latterly of a wool-factory in the neighbourhood. As a mere convenient adjunct to the mill and the factory he had started a shop in the town, and kept it going by means of a manager. Even in that light it was a handsome old shop. The walls were lined with polished oak, so was the low ceiling, and there was an oak staircase leading from one storey to another which a connoisseur in staircases might have coveted. \"Robinson's\" was a positive feature in Redcross, and if it had been anything else than a good shop of its kind would have been greatly admired. The son of the founder of the shop was also reckoned, to begin with, as good as his professional neighbours. He was college-bred, like his father, as Dora in her jealousy for the dignity of her first lover had stated. This was \"all to begin with.\" Whether because it was advisable, or from mere grovelling instincts, he dropped in turn both the mill and the factory, neither of which did more than pay its way, and retained the shop, which was understood to be a lucrative concern. He did worse; though Redcross continued to acknowledge him--somewhat dubiously to be sure--as a gentleman, because of the fine presence which Tom had not inherited, and the perfect good breeding which had descended to the son. In spite of the magnanimity which forgave frostily the second Robinson for so far forgetting himself as to take the management of his great shop into his own hands, walk up and down and receive customers, and be seen working at his books in the glass office if he did not go behind the counter, he went and married for his second wife a farmer's daughter. She was an honest, sensible, comely young woman, but she had no pretensions to be a lady, and no more inclination to enter the society of the Redcross upper class than the upper class had a mind to receive her as an equal. Charles Robinson's first wife had been all very well, though she was penniless. She had been a curate's daughter, educated to fill the post of governess in high families. She had died young, without children, and he had filled her place with the farmer's daughter, who was the mother of Tom. Thenceforth the Robinson's house, a good, old-fashioned house, though not so handsome as the shop in an adjacent street, was effaced, nominally, from the visiting-lists of those who had visiting-lists in Redcross. The family were ostracised, and left to their own devices, receiving their sentence, in the case of the farmer's daughter and her husband, with apparent equanimity.  But there was an exception made in favour of Tom. He went to the Grammar School along with the other better-class boys in the town and neighbourhood, and was accepted as their companion and playfellow. He was sent to college according to the traditions of his family, just as Cyril Carey, of Carey's Bank, and Ned Hewett, of the Rectory, were sent according to the traditions of theirs. Presumably the three young men were on one footing at Cambridge, unless, indeed, Tom had the advantage. He was slightly the elder of the three, and he took his degree with a fair amount of honour; while, sad to say, for the credit of Redcross, neither Cyril nor Ned made their last pass. It was confidently believed that Tom Robinson would cut the shop, so far as any active management of it was concerned, and enter either a gallant or a learned profession. If he had ever entertained the intention, it was put a stop to in the first place by the death of his father, followed within three months by that of his mother, shortly after Tom had completed his course at the university. He stayed at home for a time, to put his house in order it was supposed. Then all at once, in the most cold-blooded fashion, he told those who asked him that \"Robinson's\" was a good business, which he did not see himself justified in throwing up in these hard times. He was not such a conceited ass as to believe he must necessarily succeed in the crowded ranks of the professions, for none of which had he any particular bent, while he had, he added, with a certain manliness and doggedness for a pacific fellow like Robinson, a considerable interest in the great old shop. It had been in the family for three generations; he had known it from childhood; many of his father's old trusted servants still served in it. In short, he meant to keep it in his own hands, and not to let it go to sticks and staves, possibly, in the hands of others. He did not, for his part, see any mark of gentle breeding and fine feeling in devolving his responsibilities on others, and only reserving that tie to the shop which had to do with pecuniary profits. As for his university training and academic degree, if they did not benefit him in all circumstances they were not much worth. The town of Redcross was caught in a trap. The gentle-folks of the place had already received him as a man and a brother, and they could not refuse to know him any longer because he stuck to the paternal shop, though they might exercise their discretion in looking coldly on him in future. For that matter, there was another opinion among the older professional men--the Rector, whose tithes were only quarter paid; Dr. Millar, whose paying patients were no longer able to call him in on all occasions; Carey, the banker, whose private bank, it was whispered darkly, was struggling in deep waters; Colonel Russell, who had come home from India on half-pay and his savings, which every year he found more inadequate for the expenses of an increasing family. All these gray-headed men, growing haggard and careworn, agreed that in the present depressed state of the commercial world, young Robinson was showing himself a sensible fellow and ought to be commended for his decision. They declared that they were the more inclined to take him up because of it. It was their wives, where they had wives, and especially their daughters, with the young men who had not known the brunt of the battle, and felt inclined to clutch their professional dignities and privileges, that were of a different mind. Girls like the Millars turned up their saucy little noses at the shop. They thought it was mean-spirited and vulgar-minded, \"low\" of Tom Robinson to sit down with such a calling. They held it audacious of him to lift his eyes to Dora, and to follow his eyes with his voice, silent fellow though he was generally, in asking her from her father.  Certainly it did not help to redeem Tom Robinson's drawbacks in the judgment of a rash young world that he lacked his late father's fine presence. Though gentleman-like enough, he was insignificant in person, and he had little to say for himself. Probably it would have struck his critics as little short of profane to make the comparison, otherwise there is a great example that might have stood him and all men not giants and glib of tongue in good stead. It is written of an apostle, and he not the least of the apostles, that he might have been termed in bodily presence mean, and in speech contemptible. But boys and girls are not wont to take up such examples and ponder their meaning in foolish young hearts.  The Millars, as one of the girls had said, were brought up in the Old Doctor's House at Redcross. It would seem that professions and trades were hereditary in the old-fashioned, stationary town. Dr. Millar's father had not only been a doctor before him, he had been _the_ doctor in Redcross, with a practice extending from an aristocratic county to a parish-poor class of patients. His pretty sister Penny, whom Annie was not unlike, had married into the county, General Beauchamp of Wayland's younger son. The marriage, with all its consequences, was a thing of the long past, leaving little trace in the present. For young Beauchamp, though he was a squire's son, had not been able to get on at the bar, and had emigrated with his wife while emigration was still comparatively untried in Australia, where it was to be hoped his county extraction had served him in the Bush at least as well as Tom Robinson's university education would avail him in the shop. It had all happened an age before the young Millars could remember, still the tradition of a marriage of a member of a former generation of the Millars into the squirearchy had its effect on her collateral descendants. It did not signify that the reigning Beauchamps of Waylands had almost ceased to remember the ancient alliance in their dealings with their doctor. That dim and distant distinction established the superior position of the Millars in their native town, to the girls' entire satisfaction. Dora to marry Robinson, of \"Robinson's,\" a farthing candle of a man, when her Grand-aunt Penny had married a Beauchamp of Waylands, by all accounts the handsomest, most dashing member of the Hunt in his day, was a descent not to be thought of for a moment.     CHAPTER II.  THE \"COUP DE GRCE.\"   The crisis had come. Dr. Millar had granted a final formal interview, not without some agitation on the father's part, to the still more agitated suitor; and after assuring him of the paternal good-will, had turned him over to the daughter--the whole being done with a sorrowful prescience, shared by the unfortunate young man, of what the answer would be.  Poor Dora was hardly less to be pitied, for she had to be brought up to the supreme effort of dealing the _coup de grce_. Nobody could do it for her, even her mother told her that severely, in order to brace the girlish nerves, when Dora gave way to the first cowardly instinct of seeking to shirk the ordeal. If a girl was old enough to receive an offer of marriage, she was old enough to answer it for herself in person. It was the least return she could make for the high compliment which had been paid to her, to see the man and tell him with her own lips that she would have nothing to say to the honest heart and liberal hand, for he had hinted at generous settlements, which he had been only too eager to lay at her feet.  It was little use even for mild Dora to protest that she had not wished for such a compliment, and had done nothing to provoke it, so that the reckless compliment-payer was but receiving his deserts in an unconditional refusal. It did not make the step easier for her. It was no joke to her, whatever it might be to her hard-hearted young sisters.  To tell the truth, Rose and May, aye, even Annie, took much lively diversion, as Dora guessed, in secretly watching the entire proceeding. The sisters found out the hour of the compulsory interview. They covertly looked out for the arrival of the commonplace wooer--anything save their idea of a lover and hero. They keenly took note of him from an upper window as he walked with a certain studied composure, yet with a blankness of aspect, through the shrubbery. They even deigned--Annie as well as Rose and May--surreptitiously to inspect the poor wretch between the bannisters of the staircase, as he ran desperately up the stairs, thrusting one hand through his foxy hair and carrying his hat in the other, and vanished into the drawing-room.  After this brutal behaviour on the part of a trio of English girls, one must show a little moderation in condemning the cruel conduct of the Roman dames, who contemplated with zest the deadly contests of the gladiators in the arena; at least the gladiators were strangers and barbarians, not fellow-townsmen and near relations.  As for the present victim, he was happily unconscious of any spectator beyond Bella the house-maid, but he felt relieved to be delivered from her compassionate stare. He had an instinctive sense that she knew as well as he did what he had come there for, and was pitying him--an inference in which he was quite correct. For Bella was older than the unseen \"chorus\" on the landing, who did not think of pitying him. She had seen more of the world, and was better acquainted with its cares and troubles. She called him in her own mind \"the poor young gent!\" It occurred to her as it did not occur to the others, that he might take to bad ways and be a lost man, like Jem Wade the carpenter, after her pretty, flighty sister Lotty had given him the sack. Nothing less than that might be the end of this day's work.  But such a way of looking on a lover and his woes was far from the thoughts of Bella's young mistresses. On the contrary, they had difficulty in restraining merry little titters, though Annie did take herself to task and murmur \"For shame!\" when Rose made a solemn, stupid face like what she considered Tom Robinson's on this occasion.  To do the girls justice, however, they did not laugh when Dora, who had been with her mother, came slowly across the lobby and followed the visitor into the drawing-room in order to administer the _coup de grce_. It might have been a veritable dagger-thrust to be dealt by a weak little shrinking hand, with the owner's head turned and face averted--such a white, grieved, frightened girl's face it was.  Her companions' eyes were opened, for the instant a fellow-feeling smote them. This was no light jest or piece of child's play; it might be their turn next. Oh! who would not be sorry for Dora to have to inflict real pain and bitter disappointment, to be condemned to kill a man's faith in woman, perhaps, certainly to murder his peace and happiness for the present, to extinguish the sweetest, brightest dream of his early manhood, for he would never have another quite so tender and radiant? Would Dora ever be quite the same again after she had done so hard a thing?  Annie pulled herself up and accused herself of getting absolutely maudlin. The idea of Tom Robinson of \"Robinson's,\" with his middle size, matter-of-fact air, and foxy hair and moustache, entertaining such a dream and relinquishing it with a pang of mortal anguish that would leave a long sickening heart-ache behind! It was the infection of all the silly love stories she had ever read which had received a kind of spurious galvanic life from the very ordinary circumstance, the feather in her cap, as so many girls would have regarded it, of Dora, having to receive and refuse an offer of marriage. Why, she--Annie--and her sisters, including Dora herself, had been much diverted by it, as well as interested in it, until the dramatic crisis had somehow taken their breath away also, and startled them by a glimpse of the other side of the question. But though Annie strove to recover her equanimity, and Rose tried to hum a tune softly as the girls still loitered behind the bannisters, to see the end of the play, they said nothing more to each other; a sort of shyness and shame had stolen over them. It was not enough to make them run away, especially as each did not realize that what she felt was common to all. Only their lips were chained simultaneously, and they were disposed to turn aside their heads and avert their eyes, like Dora when she killed her man.  The deed did not take long--not more than was necessary for him to plead once or twice with small variation on the words, \"Will you not think of it, Dora? Can you not give it a little consideration? Perhaps if I were to wait, and you were to try----\"  And for Dora to answer with drooping head, panting breast, and still less variety in her phrases, \"Oh, no, no, Mr. Tom. Of course, I am very much obliged to you for thinking a great deal more of me than I deserve. But, indeed, indeed, it cannot be--you must give it up--this foolish fancy. It is a great pity that you have wasted time on such an absurd idea.\"  \"Wasted time!\" he repeated, with a little irony and a little pathos. \"Well, I don't think it wasted even at this moment--and--and the idea does not seem so absurd to me; but I will not distress you by forcing my wishes upon you when you are so averse to them. You will allow me to continue your friend, Miss Dora?\"  \"Yes, oh yes,\" sighed Dora, who would have said anything, short of agreeing to marry him, to get him to go away, \"if you like, after what has happened. I know I don't deserve your friendship; but, indeed, I could not help it, Mr. Robinson. I never guessed till lately that you thought of anything else, and then I would have stopped you, but I could not.\"  \"Don't blame yourself,\" he said with a faint smile, \"I am not blaming you. I shall count it a favour, an honour, if you will let me do anything for you that I can.\"  \"Thank you very much,\" she murmured humbly.  \"Then you will accept a little mark of my friendly feelings?\" He took a small case from his waistcoat pocket, opened it, and drew from it a valuable ring, holding it out to her.  They were the most beautiful rubies and sapphires she had ever seen. But she would not touch it; she even put her hands behind her back in her confusion and dismay. \"I could not; I ought not. It is far too costly a thing, I can see that at a glance. You must keep it; you will find some far fitter girl to give it to.\"  He shook his head, hesitated, and then took an old-fashioned little vinaigrette case, shaped like a tiny gold box, from the watch-chain at which he wore it. \"Will you accept this from me, then? It was my mother's, and I should like you to have it.\"  \"It's so good of you,\" the girl faltered. \"I don't like to deprive you of what was your mother's, but if you care that I should have it----\"  \"I do care,\" he said.  That last little episode was entirely between themselves. When she quitted the room, not crying, but paler than before, she had the vinaigrette case clasped tightly in her hand, while nobody except Tom Robinson knew of the gift.  He let her go, and then he left the house. When he did so there was that in his face which caused Rose Millar to cry under her breath, \"Come away. It is not fair to spy upon him. I'll never want to see anybody refused again.\" As for \"little May,\" she burst into tears, though the principals had shed no tears.  \"Hold your tongue, you little goose,\" remonstrated the disturbed Annie. \"He may hear you. School-girls like you and Rose should not meddle in grown-up people's affairs.\"  \"I thought I had left school after the Christmas holidays,\" said Rose, interrogating the world in an abstract fashion. She was herself again on the instant, carrying her funny little crumpled nose well in the air.  \"It is dreadful,\" said May, with a half-suppressed sob, \"and he was so good-natured. He promised only last week to get Rose and me a fox-terrier puppy.\"  \"Oh, you selfish little creature! It is over the failure of the prospective puppy and not over the sorrows of the rejected man you are lamenting. Never mind, Maisie, I doubt if mother would have allowed us to keep the puppy. As for Mr. Tom Robinson, he is cut up just now, of course; but he will soon get over it. How long does it take a man to forget, Annie? Anyhow, presently he will be busily directing his attentions in another quarter, until the day may come, after he is successful and triumphant, well pleased with himself and his choice, when he will heartily thank Dora there for having administered to him the cold bath of a rejection, so nipping his first raw aspirations in the bud.\"  \"No, no,\" insisted May; \"you are so cynical, Rose, like everybody else now-a-days, and I hate it. He can never be glad to have lost Dora.\"  \"Don't you agree with me, Annie?\" Rose maintained her point.  \"Really, you seem to be so well informed on the subject yourself--though I cannot think where you have got your experience, any more than your slang, unless at second-hand\"--said Annie sarcastically, \"that my opinion is of no importance.\"  \"Now, don't be nasty and elder-sisterish,\" was Rose's quick rejoinder.  Though Dora shed no tears of contrition in public, Annie, who shared her sister's room, heard her in the night crying softly.  \"What ails you, Dora dear?\" Annie sat up and asked sleepily. \"What is the matter? It can't be, no,\" rousing herself, \"it can _not_ be--you don't mean that you repent what you've done, and would swallow the shop, foxy hair, and everything?\"  \"Oh, no,\" denied Dora, \"but I didn't think a man would care like that; such a queer, gray shade came over his face, though I durst hardly look at him; and his hands which were--well, were holding mine for a second, you know----\"  \"No, I don't know,\" interrupted Annie, smiling to herself; \"but go on, what about the hands?\"  \"They were as cold as ice.\"  \"Very likely, it is only the month of April.\"  \"And it is not above a year since he lost both his father and mother--all the near relations he had.\"  \"Poor man!\" admitted Annie. \"But you could not help that, and many men, young men especially, seem to get on quite well without near relations.\"  There was a strain of hardness about pretty Annie, whether bred of that cynicism in the air of which May had complained, whether it was an integral part of Annie, or whether, as in the case of some valuable kinds of timber, it was merely an indication of the closer grain, the slower ripening, and the greater power of endurance of the moral fibre.  \"Men are not like women.\" Annie was continuing her lecture. \"I dare say Tom Robinson will do very well--all the better, perhaps, because he has no ambition, and is content to make money in the most humdrum way as a tradesman.\"  Dora sat up in turn, like a white ghost in her place in her little bed, seen by the dim light. She had the instinct which causes women to look back upon the men who have made love or proposed to them, even though the women have rejected the men--as in a sense their property, if not their prey, so as not by any means to relish the men's depreciation at the hands of other women. Then it becomes a point of honour alike with the proudest and the meekest of her sex to stand up in his absence in defence of the discarded swain.  \"I don't know about ambition,\" began Dora hesitatingly, \"but father says Tom Robinson is not at all stupid; he took his degree with credit at Cambridge, and was not plucked like poor Ned Hewett, or that fop, Cyril Carey. Father says when he worked with Mr. Robinson in getting up the bill to lay before Parliament for closing the old churchyard, he could not have desired a more intelligent, diligent fellow-worker. All the salesmen and women at 'Robinson's' have been well looked after, and are superior to the other shop-people in the town, don't you know? There is Miss Franklin at the head of both the millinery and mantua-making departments; I am sure she looks and speaks, as well as dresses, like a lady?\"  \"Yes, and everybody is civil to her, but nobody thinks of making her acquaintance out of the shop, and she is wise enough to keep to her proper sphere. They say she is a distant relation of Tom Robinson's--you see he is not altogether destitute of kindred. Why does the man not marry her? That would be a suitable match.\"  \"Annie!\" protested Dora, in nearly speechless indignation, and then she recovered breath and words. \"She's forty if she's a day; and she's as fat as a pin-cushion, with her cheeks a mottled red all over.\"  \"How can you make such unkind remarks on your neighbours' looks? _He_ is not an Adonis, I may be allowed to say; and I have noticed that shopkeepers are apt to marry women older than themselves, women who have been in the trade--to keep the business together, I suppose.\"  \"At least, his father did not marry like that either in his first or in his second marriage,\" retorted Dora; \"for the first Mrs. Robinson was the daughter of a curate, and the second of a farmer, and she was not half his age, though she did not survive him long.\"  \"As you please. What's Hecuba to me, or what am I to Hecuba?\" demanded Annie airily.  \"Besides,\" Dora returned laboriously to the charge, \"there are shopkeepers and shopkeepers, as you must be aware, Annie. Father says old Mr. Robinson was a man of independent ideas and original mind, and had his own theories of trade.\"  \"I have nothing to say against it, especially at this hour of the night, or morning,\" said Annie, professing to strangle a yawn; \"only that I do not think a linen-draper's business, however large and well-conducted, is exactly the career of a gentleman, a man of fair ability and education. He might leave it to any respectable well-disposed tradesman. However, if you are going to exalt Tom Robinson, with his shop, into a patriot and philanthropist cherishing a noble scheme for the public good, and all that kind of thing, do it if you like, nobody will hinder you. Call him back if you care to, I dare say it is still possible if you are willing to make the concession. But oh, Dora!\" appealed Annie, who had talked herself wide awake by this time, \"don't forget the loss of position involved in really keeping a shop, however eccentric and meritorious a man's intentions may be. Why, he had better become a stonemason or a ploughman, if he is to do the thing at all; far better a gamekeeper or a soldier in time of war, the plunge would be deeper but more picturesque. Think of the entire breaking with the county with which we have a right to hold ourselves connected, not merely because father's patients are willing to take us up and make quite a fuss about us sometimes, but because his Aunt Penny married and was welcomed into that set. You have not yourself alone to consider, remember, Dora; you might not mind, but you have the rest of us to think of, some of whom would mind very much.\"  \"You need have no anxiety about the matter,\" said poor Dora hotly and huffily. \"I am not going to marry Tom Robinson; you know I have refused him this very afternoon.\"  But Annie was determined to empty out her whole budget of warnings. \"Even professional people like father, all our friends and acquaintances, our relations on both sides of the house would begin to drop us, and fight shy of us. What people that had any pretensions to being gentle-folks would care to be mixed up with our brother-in-law the linen-draper? And it is not as if the temptation were great; I cannot see wherein the attraction lies; but instead of letting it beset you, please don't lose sight of the three hundred and sixty-five days to be spent every year in Tom Robinson's silent company. Think of the three hundred and sixty-five breakfasts, dinners, and suppers to be eaten opposite his mute figure.\"  \"Stop, Annie,\" Dora cried energetically: \"you know as well as I do that I could never face such a thing, that I never dreamt of it. Only loving a man could make it possible for a girl to give up her family in order to belong to him; and even if there had been no 'Robinson's' to shock you, I do not care the least little bit for poor Tom Robinson; yet surely for that very reason,\" protested Dora with a sudden revulsion of feeling, \"I am at liberty to pity him.\"  \"If you will take my advice, Dora,\" said shrewd Annie, sinking back on her pillow as a sign that the untimely discussion ought to come to an end, \"you will get rid of your pity as quickly as you can. It is not your pity which he seeks--very likely he would rage like a bear, for as quiet as he can look, at the mere mention of it. But it strikes me that it is not safe for either of you.\"     CHAPTER III.  THE HEADS OF THE HOUSE LOOK GRAVE.   \"It is a thousand pities,\" said Dr. Millar, holding a consultation with his wife, while he sipped his glass of sherry and ate his biscuit, before retiring for the night, after his last round among the patients in greatest need of his visits.  In spite of his daughter Dora's preference for tall men, the Doctor was short and rather stout. He ought to have looked comfortable, he had the physique and air of a comfortable man, but a certain harassed, careworn expression was beginning to settle down on the spectacled face which had once been round, rosy, and very comely. He was at least twenty years older than his wife. The old-fashioned practice had prevailed in the old-fashioned town, of elderly men, whether bachelors or widowers, ending by marrying for the first or the second time women a score or more years their juniors. Indeed, Dr. Millar was hard upon seventy, though he had till recent bad times carried his years so well that he had looked ten years younger than his actual age.  Mrs. Millar also began to look worried as a rule, though she had more of the woman's faculty of putting the best face on things, both in public and in private. She was a tall woman, who had enjoyed the advantages of what was called \"an elegant figure\" in her youth. Now she was large and heavy, with a mixture of unconscious stateliness and wistful motherliness in her gait and gestures. Like Dr. Millar, she ought to have seemed at least easy-minded, but circumstances were becoming more and more against the happy condition, of which a pervading atmosphere of content and cheerfulness should have been the outward expression.  The man and woman were not cut out, so to speak, for adversity. They had not been seasoned to it in their younger days. On the contrary, they had been cradled for many years in the lap--if not of luxury, of fair middle-class prosperity. It was a few tolerably rough jolts which had shaken them from their cradle. Still the trouble was more in apprehension than in reality. As yet it had not caused the sufferers to change any one of the domestic habits which had grown second nature to them. It had not induced them to darken the sunny sky over their young daughters' heads with a shadow of the clouds which were already looming black on the parents' horizon. It may be said at once, that Dr. and Mrs. Millar, though they were reckoned clever, sensible people enough by their contemporaries, had softer hearts than they had hard heads. They had not been used to painful self-denial and stern discipline, either where they themselves or their children were concerned.  The couple were sitting now together in the dining-room with its solidly handsome furniture, Russian leather and walnut wood, bits of family plate on the sideboard, bronze chimney-piece ornaments, and good engravings on the walls. Husband and wife had spent the last part of the evening there, for four-and-twenty years, every night they were in Redcross, when the Doctor was not kept out late, or when the couple were not abroad in company, or seeing company at home. Dr. Millar, in his slightly old-fashioned professional black coat and white tie, was leaning back in his easy-chair sipping his sherry, and occasionally drumming lightly on the table near him with these fine long sensitive fingers which were a born doctor's fingers.  Mrs. Millar wore a demi-toilet in the shape of an expensive cashmere and silk gown--not an evening dress, but an approach to it, as became the wife of one of the leading professional men in Redcross, connected with the county to boot. Her lace cap was a costly trifle of its kind, but it had an awkward habit--the odder in a woman who was neat to formality in the other details of her dress--of slipping to one side, or tilting forwards or backwards on the brown hair, still abundant and just streaked with gray; so that one or other of her daughters was constantly calling Mrs. Millar's cap to order and setting it right. She was sitting in an arm-chair, opposite her husband. Mechanically she put one daintily slippered, very neat foot, considering the weight it helped to carry, beyond her skirts, and stretched it towards the fire. There was still a good fire blazing in the steel grate, though the spring was well advanced, the weather was not more than chilly, and the hour was late. It was as if coals were not a marketable commodity and a serious item in the expenses of an embarrassed household. She held up a Japanese fan between her face and the fire, from mere custom, for she had ceased to pay much heed to the exigencies of a florid complexion.  \"It's a thousand pities,\" repeated the little Doctor, looking quite portentously regretful and oppressed. \"It is not only that Tom Robinson is an excellent fellow and would have made Dora the best of husbands--given her a safe and happy home, and all that sort of thing; but in case of anything happening, I am convinced he would have been as good as a brother to the other girls, and a son to you. A man like him is a stay and support to a household of helpless women.\"  \"But nothing is going to happen, Jonathan,\" said Mrs. Millar, with an involuntary nervous quiver which sent her cap hovering over one eyebrow. \"At least nothing worse than we know. Your practice is not so lucrative as it used to be; how can it, in these bad times, with so many poor young fellows of doctors settling here and there and everywhere in Redcross and the villages around, starving themselves out, while they impoverish their seniors? Nothing more than that, except the little trouble at Carey's Bank.\"  \"Quite enough too, Maria, quite enough,\" commented the Doctor deep down in his throat, prolonging the words a little as if he were chanting the refrain of a dismal song; \"and when a man is my age and has plenty of the young rivals you refer to, it is high time he should be looking out for something happening. A family of girls, too. God help me! If they had been four boys, who might have made their own way in the world, and provided for you among them, I could have faced it better.\" He struck the table again, with spasmodic force this time.  \"Now, Jonathan, you will wake up the house. This is not like you,\" remonstrated his wife--all the more energetically that her heart sank while she spoke. \"I should not have expected you to give way in this manner.\" She gave a quick push back to her unruly cap. \"I am sure there is no occasion for it. We are in no worse position than we were last year, even the year before that.\"  \"Save that I am growing older every year,\" he said grimly, \"and the affairs of the bank are not mending, as I hoped they might.\"  \"Can't you sell out?\" she suggested breathlessly, as she clasped her hands on her knees.  \"I have put it off too long, supposing I had the conscience to transfer my liabilities to some simpleton who might not draw half a dozen of the dividends of which I have drawn scores. Besides, the thing is impossible, as I am telling you. Between you and me, the shares are far below par.\"  \"What is par, Jonathan?\" interrupted Mrs. Millar in a praiseworthy attempt to understand her husband.  \"Oh, bother,\" he cried, running his hand in mild exasperation through his white hair; \"the standard value, or the original value, whichever you like best. I should not dare to propose to sell out at such a loss; it would not only be to impoverish myself at once in order to avoid the risk of greater ruin, it would draw attention. It would have a most suspicious look, and might bring the rotten affair down about our ears instantly, while I should get the blame of the downfall.\"  \"But some of the large foreign investments might be realized any day--you told me the last time you spoke of business--with the first good turn of trade,\" she reminded him anxiously.  \"I trust so still, and I believe old Carey is an honest man and a perfect gentleman--that is one comfort; but I cannot help thinking he has got into bad hands. I tell you, Maria, I don't like that brother-in-law of his who comes down from London to attend the Redcross meetings, and tries to blarney us all round. And I cannot approve of the bolstering up of Carey's cousins, the Carters, in their chemical works at Stokeleigh, which it strikes me will never do much good. It--the bolstering up--has been going on for a long time now, to what extent I am not prepared to show. Unfortunately I have a bad head for figures,\" he shrugged his shoulders as if anticipating a reproach, \"the less reason why I should have laid out my savings on bank shares, you will say? No doubt, no doubt, but there had been fewer troubles with banks in my day. When I made the first investment everything appeared right, and the dividends announced were tempting.\"  \"I am not finding fault with what you did, Jonathan; I never thought of such a thing,\" the perturbed woman found voice to reassure her husband. \"I know you did it for the best; and for that matter, I am convinced it will all come right in the end,\" she ended with a little sigh.  \"It is very good and pretty of you to say so, Maria,\" he said with a certain old-fashioned, stiff gallantry which, while it complimented her, treated her as a much younger and more irresponsible being than he was. As he spoke he took up the hand which lay in her lap and held it for a moment clasped in his. \"And I can say you have been all that I could have wished as a wife and mother, you have never once failed me during the whole of our married life.\"  \"Oh! thank you, thank you, Jonathan.\" She acknowledged his praise with a momentary choke in her voice, and a bend of her head which was not without a docile dignity.  \"We are all in the same boat,\" resumed the Doctor in the deep tones which somehow sounded like bass recitative; \"the Rector, Colonel Russell, and I--not to say Carey himself. We all wished to increase our incomes with as little trouble and risk as possible--so it seemed then, but if the bank comes to smash, all the old Redcross gentle-folks, as we were pleased to call ourselves, will go with it.\"  \"Don't mention such a thing, don't think of it,\" cried Mrs. Millar in her dismay.  He went on without noticing her. \"The Bishop won't let the Rector come down, and Russell is twenty years younger than I. He is no older than you are, though a foreign climate has told a good deal on him; still, he is patched up, and with care ought to have lasted as long as the rest of us. He may exert his interest, and get a post in India again, though I should be afraid it would finish him in six months.\"  The poor middle-aged lady who sat listening with dry lips apart, and pleasant hazel eyes distended with fright and distress, though she was no older than the unfortunate colonel, had not been exposed to a foreign climate, and had hardly suffered from a serious illness in her life, did not look much like such an arduous undertaking as going out to India to redeem a wrecked fortune. She pulled herself together, however, and set herself to the good woman's business of comforting and encouraging her husband. \"I am certain it is right to go on hoping. You often say that in your profession you have no such helpful allies as hope and courage; you must practice what you've preached, Doctor,\" and the faithful soul actually contrived to impart a playful ring to her unsteady voice. \"The Rector has not preached the duty more strenuously than you have; and you are not going to be the first to break down, especially when there is no real occasion. Depend upon it, Carey's Bank will pull through like some of your most doubtful patients, with time and care.\"  \"With all my heart,\" he said, absently taking off his spectacles, polishing, and replacing them. Then he resumed his former line of thought. \"Tom Robinson is out of the mess. He, and his father before him, found other ways of disposing of their capital where it was more under their own inspection and control. If that foolish girl of ours, Maria, could only have brought herself to listen to Robinson,\" he worked himself up into a fresh access of vexation, \"the liking would have come in good time. I did not expect her to have a fancy for him on the spot, for quiet, steady young fellows like him are not apt to take girls' fancies--the worse for the girls.\"  \"But, father\"--remonstrated Mrs. Millar, involuntarily bestowing on her husband the title the girls gave him--she drew herself up as she spoke, and again destroyed the equilibrium of her cap--\"you cannot surely think that Tom Robinson would have been a fit match for Dora, or any of her sisters. He is well enough in himself, I say nothing against him, but he has not gone into a profession, instead he has identified himself with 'Robinson's'--that shop;\" a shade of ineffable disgust stole into her ordinarily good-humoured voice.  \"Showed his good sense and manliness,\" said the Doctor gruffly. \"I wish every one else had been as wise. I wish all of us had big paying shops at our backs instead of Carey's shaky bank. I for one would swallow the indignity cheerfully. Why, my father kept on his dispensary in the days when the practice was at its best. The greater fool I to give it up. I tell you England will never be what it was till it gets rid of this rubbish of despising trades and shops. Don't you help to put it into these silly girls' heads. It makes me sick to think how they may live to wish they were connected with an honest, solvent shop.\"  \"My dear, I think you are going a little too far.\" Mrs. Millar fired up in defence of her young like a ruffled mother-pigeon. \"I should be very sorry to teach the girls to look down on anybody; but that there are different sorts and conditions of men, they may learn from their very Bibles and prayer-books. There are such things as education and culture--not to speak of good birth. You yourself, Dr. Millar, are fairly well born and well connected for a professional man.\" She instanced this with an imperceptible bridle and toss of her matronly head, which hinted broadly, \"If it had not been so, Jonathan, I should never have been Mrs. Millar.\" The movement threatened to deposit her cap on the carpet behind her, but she recovered it in time, and took up the thread of her discourse by quoting the much-prized family distinction--\"There was your Aunt Penny, who married into the county.\"  \"Oh! are you at that humbug?\" he cried, with a man's disrespectful impatience. \"I thought it had seen its day, and was long over and done with. I could not have conceived that you--\" (\"were such a fool,\" he was going to say, when he caught himself up.) He was quick-tempered and impulsive, but he was also suave by nature, and his long habit of courteous indulgence to his wife caused him to alter the phrase. \"I did not know that you had so lively an imagination as to persist in believing that old myth, Maria.\"  \"But your Aunt Penny did marry one of the Beauchamps of Waylands,\" insisted Mrs. Millar.  \"Certainly; and she made the poorest marriage of anybody that I have ever had to do with, though I have always understood that he was not a bad sort, beyond being as thick-headed as his brother the squire or an officer of dragoons. He get on at the bar! I dare say not. And he was no quicker-witted or longer-sighted in Australia. You must have heard me say how grieved I was once when I came across a fellow from Sydney who had been up the country, and remembered something of the Beauchamps and their straits. They were regularly hard up, and went through no end of trouble. Poor Aunt Penny seldom had a woman-servant--women-servants were more difficult to get out there in those days. She had to wash, cook, and scour for the men at the station.\"  \"Why didn't they come home?\" inquired Mrs. Millar rather weakly.  \"Come home! They had nothing to come home with, or to. You don't suppose his brother, the squire, with a wife and family of his own, would have kept them, though the Beauchamps had received her civilly enough at the time of the marriage! She had to milk the cows when the cow-man was otherwise wanted. I do not say that many a better born woman than she was has not done as much and thought little of it, only it was not in Aunt Penny's line. I can just remember her when I was a small boy, a pretty creature who read Italian, sang to her guitar, and made bread seals for her amusement. She had such a mortal terror where cows were concerned that she would run like a lapwing when she heard one come lowing up the lane behind the house. Paton, the man from Sydney who remembered them, thought they did a little better towards the end, when they got a store, and Mrs. Beauchamp kept it. Do you hear that, Maria?\" cried the Doctor, with a half-humorous, half-indignant emphasis.  \"Yes, I hear,\" replied Mrs. Millar, with an obstinate inflection of her voice which said, \"I am of my own opinion still.\" She illustrated this by adding, in an undertone, \"They were in Australia.\"  \"A store,\" continued the Doctor, \"is the rudest, most uncouth kind of shop; and Beauchamp was not fit to keep it, he had to turn it over to his wife, who was thankful to serve shepherds and bush-rangers for aught I know. She lost one child in the bush, God help her! The little thing wandered away and was never heard of again; and her other child, a boy, who grew up, did not turn out well. I tell you, I never like to think or speak of the mother.\"  \"Poor Aunt Penny!\" said Mrs. Millar hastily. \"But there is one thing\"--with a sudden accent of triumph in the perception that she had the advantage of her husband at last--\"your Aunt Penny married the man she cared for; she got her choice, and in that light she had no reason to complain, though she had to abide by it.\"  The Doctor was a little taken aback. \"I do not know that she complained--at least her people at home heard nothing of it. And you must do me the justice of owning that I have done nothing to force Dora's inclinations. Indeed, I am not clear that I have done my duty. I ought to have reasoned with the girl. Robinson is not only a good man, he is also a gentleman, every inch of him, so was his father before him.\"  \"In the choice of Jenny Coppock, of Coppock's Farm, for a wife!\" exclaimed Mrs. Millar, still rebellious, even satirical and disdainful.  \"He was entitled to choose whom he would, I suppose, so long as she was an honest woman, and Jenny Coppock was that quite as much as her husband was a gentleman. She made him happy, I believe, strange as it may sound to some people, as ladies do not always make their husbands happy--you know I mean nothing personal, Maria. Whether she was quite happy herself is a different question, of which I have had no means of judging. But I have heard you yourself say that she never presumed on her rise in rank, or sought to thrust her comely, kindly face where it was not wanted. Her son has a look of her, without her good looks. Poor Mrs. Robinson! I was with her in her first and last illness, as you are aware, and a more courageous, self-forgetful soul I had never the privilege to attend.\"  Mrs. Millar turned back in the conversation, and took to dogmatizing. \"People who are well-informed and well-bred will never descend to a lower level without great discomfort and serious loss. I for one, though I have not profited by the advantages the girls have commanded, and I daresay have not their brains\"--she made the frank admission with womanly, motherly humility--\"though I could not to save my life make one of Rose's beautiful water-colour sketches, or read Greek and Latin like 'little May,' or even talk to the point on every subject under the sun like Annie, still I should not be happy if I had to keep company with Wilkins the butcher's or Ord the baker's wife, and they would not be happy either. It would not matter, in one sense, though I knew they were respectable, worthy women, and were ever so much better off as to money than I. That would not keep me from feeling thoroughly out of place and having hardly an idea in common with my neighbours in their plush-trimmed gowns and fur-lined mantles. I could not stand such degradation for my girls,\" she protested, with rising agitation. \"I had far rather that they and I should be the poorest ladies in the land, should have to pinch and deny ourselves all round.\"  \"It is little you know of it,\" muttered Dr. Millar, shaking his white head, and pensively contemplating his finger-nails.  \"While we still retained the position to which we were born, and the associations among which we were reared,\" ended Mrs. Millar, with a gasp.  \"Bless the woman, what does she mean?\" cried Dr. Millar after his lively fashion, with an air of injured innocence. \"Does she pretend that Tom Robinson has not been educated--stamped, for that matter, with the last university brand, to which he does credit, I must say? Stay, there goes the night-bell. I am wanted for somebody.\"  \"You'll never go out again to-night, Jonathan,\" pleaded Mrs. Millar, \"after all your worry, when you have not had more than a couple of hours' rest.\" She was already reproaching herself keenly for having contradicted and argued with him. She had never been able to comprehend, for her comfort, that to a man like him an argument is both rousing and refreshing. In the middle of her remorse she instinctively held up her head, and balanced her cap as a Dutchwoman of the last century balanced her milk-pail, or a girl of the Roman Campagna her sheaf of grass and wild flowers. \"It is a shame,\" she reflected indignantly; \"it is very likely nothing of any consequence, just one of those inconsiderate people who think that a professional man ought to be always at their beck and call.\"  \"There, Maria, you're scoring another point for trade,\" said the little doctor, getting on his feet, and buttoning up his coat as a preliminary to obeying the call. \"I'll warrant Wilkins and Ord will be toasting their toes, and retiring to bed with the comfortable conviction that their night's rest will not be disturbed; since Wilkins's head-man attends to the slaughter-house, and the eldest journeyman baker sees to the setting of the sponge. Why don't you say, _noblesse oblige_, Maria? But I think I know the name of the inconsiderate individual who has interrupted our conversation, and I assure you he would not if he could. It is little Johnny Fleming--Fleming the grocer's son--whose case is critical, I fear. I told his mother if he got worse to send for me at once. When I am out, at any rate, I'll just look in on old Todd, in Skinners' Buildings. He appeared in a dying state this morning; but as the family have not sent to let me know of the death, if he has hung on so long, the chance is he will rally and come round this bout. I'll be some time; don't sit up for me, my dear.\"  \"It is too bad,\" Mrs. Millar fretted. \"They ought to send at night for Newton or Capes from Woodleigh--it is only a step for any of the young doctors, instead of disturbing a man of your age.\"  \"Good heavens! don't breathe such a thing. I could not afford it. I thought of taking a young partner twenty years ago, but I put it off till it was too late. Perhaps it was a mistake; we all make mistakes,\" he sighed. \"An active young practitioner, well up to date, might have kept the business better together.\"  \"Nonsense!\" cried his wife energetically. \"Nobody would have looked at him when they could have had your skill and experience.\"  \"Then be thankful I'm still fit for work--one must take the bad with the good. It is the fortune of war, Maria,\" said the gallant old doctor as he departed.     CHAPTER IV.  THE CRASH.   Within a month Carey's Bank broke, not altogether unexpectedly. The breaking carried dismay and desolation into not a few households in Redcross, and administered a sharp shock--productive of much startled speculation, and roused distrust, even in those quarters which had not suffered financially by the bankruptcy. The stoppage of a bank, with little hope of its resuming its functions, is like the stoppage of a heart which will never beat again. It may have been dreaded as a possible calamity, and occasionally hinted at in awed whispers; but when the blow falls it does so with a stunning, crushing force because of its irreparable nature and far-reaching ruin.  There was just a little preparation to herald the catastrophe. Poor Carey, an honest, weak tool of dishonest speculators and birds of prey in the shape of needy, unscrupulous relations, when the appalling tidings reached him which could only betoken immediate wreck, did all that there was left to him to do. He called a meeting of the Redcross shareholders. These were the leading professional men in the town who had invested their savings, and a small proportion of the neighbouring country gentlemen who had put a little capital--not often to spare in those days--in a concern once regarded as sound and incapable of collapse as the Bank of England itself. With a faltering tongue and a hanging head the nominal head of the firm told to those nearly concerned what was coming on them. Nobody reproached him; either no man had the heart, or all felt the uselessness of reproaches. Certainly these shareholders' silence was his heaviest punishment.  They made a hasty examination, as far as they could, for themselves, and then the meeting broke up. Its members did not even linger to consult, being well assured that consultation, like reproaches, would be of no avail; the failure was so much more extensive and complete than their worst fears had led them to anticipate. The men looked blankly in each other's whitening faces and sought the refuge of their own houses at first. There would be time enough for outcry, for desperate plans and schemes a little later.  Poor Dr. Millar had not even this breathing space. It happened to be a particularly busy day with him. Various neutral individuals, in no way concerned with Carey's Bank, even when its misfortunes should be made public, took that inconvenient time for falling ill, and their medical man had to attend upon them with spasmodic promptitude and mechanical attention--projected, as it were, against the dazed and confused background of his brain. After all he was glad of his profession with its outward and immediate calls, taking him out of himself in the hour when he had heard the worst. He preferred to be about the town doing battle with this man's attack of paralysis and that woman's symptoms of typhoid, even though his ears were ringing with clamorous questions which no one else could hear or answer. How was he to pay up the liabilities of his bank shares from his dwindling practice? What about inexperienced young girls driven out to make their own way in the world, and the gentlewoman (in every sense of the word) whom he had loved and cherished for four-and-twenty years, soon to be left a desolate, all but unprovided for widow? But better a thousand times to be dragged in different directions than to be sitting like Russell, locked in his room, his little children and their young mother shut out, holding between his hands the erect head of a soldier who had come out of many a hard battle, but none so hard as this ambuscade which had been sprung upon him after he had been invalided a dozen years before, and returned home to spend his declining years in peace. Better than to have to write sermons and read prayers, like the Rector, and pause between every sentence to take himself sternly to task. Was it common forethought and prudence, with the necessity of providing for the wants of a household, which even the apostle Paul had commended, or was it worldly-mindedness and greed which had brought him, a beneficed clergyman, a priest in holy orders, the vowed servant of a King whose kingdom was not of this world, to this lamentable pass? Yes; he would be dishonoured in the eyes of men, a debtor who could not pay his debts, and even with the support of his bishop would be scarcely able to weather the storm, while he must make up his mind, as he was an honest man, that he and his should endure the pinch of poverty for the rest of his days.  Annie and Dora had been out on a shopping expedition, and were coming in talking and laughing as usual, when they were startled by the apparition of their mother standing in the doorway of her room, and motioning to them to come in directly and speak with her. The poor lady really looked like a ghost, as she stood there with her fine colour gone, beckoning to her daughters with her hand, as if the power of speech had suddenly forsaken her.  \"What is it, mother?\" cried the alarmed girls in one breath, hurrying towards her. \"Has anything happened? Is anybody ill?\"  \"Hush! hush, my dears,\" said Mrs. Millar in a low tone, carefully shutting the door of her room behind the girls, as if she were ready to guard her secret with her life--at the same time painfully sensible that the bad news would be all over Redcross the next day, or the next after that. \"I thought it would be better to tell you myself; nobody in the house knows anything of it yet, except your father and me.\"  \"But what is it, mother; you have not told us?\" Annie urged; while Mrs. Millar sank down in a low wicker chair, and her daughter Dora instinctively stooped over her, and began to set her vagrant cap right.  \"Never mind my cap, my love,\" said Mrs. Millar hurriedly, and then she grew incoherent. \"What does it matter, when perhaps I may not long have a cap to wear.\"  Annie and Dora stared at each other in consternation. Was their mother going out of her senses?  \"It is the bank, Carey's Bank,\" said Mrs. Millar, recovering herself, \"Oh dear! I am afraid it is in a very bad way.\"  \"Is that it?\" cried Annie vaguely but gravely, opening wide her brown eyes. \"Is it going to fail?\" She, too, spoke of the bank as if it were a responsible being.  \"Annie, Annie, take care what you say. Girls are so heedless. I tell you it is very dangerous to make such broad statements. You do not know what harm you may do by a single word when you are so childishly outspoken.\" Mrs. Millar felt bound even yet to give her own words the timid qualification, though she was forced to add the next moment, \"Your father has suspected things were going wrong for some time, and spoken of his suspicions to me repeatedly. He has just come back from a private meeting of the Redcross shareholders. He says in consequence of some additional losses in South America, I think, and inability to realize capital there, the bank cannot meet two or three heavy calls at home. I daresay I am not telling you rightly, for I don't understand business, and I don't suppose you do.\"  \"I understand so far, that if this is not failure, I don't know what is,\" said Annie.  \"Don't, Annie,\" said Dora; \"let mother tell us in her own way; it is not easy for her, it is a dreadful misfortune.\"  \"You may say that, Dora,\" exclaimed her mother. \"Your father does not believe the bank can hold out for another week; it may stop payment to-morrow, since there are rumours afloat which will destroy what credit it has left.\"  \"Will no other bank help it?\" cried Annie shrewdly.  \"I believe not,\" said Mrs. Millar dolefully.  \"Then there will be a run, like what one has read of in similar circumstances--a rush of the people, and a riot in the town,\" suggested Annie, getting excited over the idea. \"The police may have to guard the bank and the Bank house--soldiers may have to come from Nenthorn!\"  \"Oh, surely not,\" cried Dora; \"the poor Careys--who could treat them so cruelly?\"  \"No, no,\" said Mrs. Millar; \"there is one good thing, your father does not think there will be much ill-feeling, or anything like an angry mob, or tumult--not even when the people see the closed doors. There has always been such confidence in Carey's Bank, the Careys have been respected for generations; even now it is James Carey's misfortune and not his fault, though he may have been misled and imposed upon; and, after all, the depositors are tolerably sure of their money in time. But your father is afraid,\" she ended, her voice sinking, \"that it will go hard with the shareholders.\"  \"And poor father is one of them,\" said Annie quickly.  \"Poor father!\" echoed Dora piteously; \"and you, poor, poor mother, to have to think of us, and break it to us, while your heart is with father.\"  \"And he has not even been left in peace for a single afternoon, to make up his mind what we shall do,\" lamented his sympathetic wife. \"As usual, so many tiresome people have fallen ill--as if they did it on purpose, and sent for him.\"  \"I daresay they could not help it,\" said Annie, \"and I don't think it would quite suit father if they were never ill.\"  \"Don't speak so unfeelingly, child,\" remonstrated her mother; \"well, I suppose I gave you a bad example,\" she corrected herself immediately, \"but I have been in such trouble since lunch time.\"  \"Poor mother!\" repeated Dora in a voice that was only more soft and caressing because of its sorrowfulness. She was very fond of her mother, who reciprocated the special fondness, while Dr. Millar was rather inclined to favour Annie and Rose, and both father and mother petted May.  \"Will it ruin us, mother?\" inquired Annie directly, but before her mother could answer her, Annie's practical mind took a sudden flight. It went straight back to the purchases which she and Rose had been making that afternoon. They had been at \"Robinson's,\" of all places. But Tom Robinson was only to be seen in the glass office, or walking about the place in the morning, at hours which these two customers had carefully avoided. Dora's heart had quaked all the same, in dread of an event which, bad enough when it was confined to a passing bow, or a limp hand-shake and half a dozen words exchanged in the street, would have been intolerable in \"Robinson's,\" under the eyes of his satellites. Yet for the Millars to have refrained altogether from going to the one great shop in the town, where women oft did congregate, would have been to expose an event, the participators in which devoutly hoped was buried in oblivion. They had been in Miss Franklin's department without anything untoward happening; but it was neither \"Robinson's\" nor the person who served them there that flashed like lightning across Annie's thoughts at this crisis. It was the articles the girls had been buying, the Tussore silk and Torchon lace for frocks that Annie and Dora had meant to wear at a garden-party--for which the Dyers, the new people who had come to Redcross Manor-house, had sent out invitations. If the Millars were ruined, they were not likely to go to many more garden-parties, and though the sisters might still want frocks, yet frocks of Tussore silk trimmed with Torchon lace--granted that the materials had appeared a modest and becoming wear for a doctor's daughters an hour before--might not be quite an appropriate selection in the family's altered circumstances.  \"It depends upon what you call ruin,\" Mrs. Millar was saying falteringly, \"and of course the bank's assets may turn out better than is thought just now, though your father is far from hopeful. He says all his savings will go, and he may count on having to pay bank 'calls' on his income till the business is wound up, which may not be in his lifetime. No doubt he is taking the darkest view of things at present.\" Then she yielded to the relief of pouring forth some of the coming woes in detail. \"Oh, my dears, your father says, though nothing can be settled in a moment, there is one thing certain--this house must be given up.\"  \"Our house!\" cried both of the girls in dismay.  \"Where we were all born, where father himself was born,\" pleaded Dora, still hanging about her mother.  \"The Old Doctor's House--why, it seems to belong to the practice,\" protested Annie, sitting down, taking off her hat and tossing it on the bed as if the better to realize the situation.  \"No, I don't think it would hurt the practice--not in a town the size of Redcross, where everybody would know where your father was to be found, though he were to change his house again and again. Still it does seem hard,\" she admitted, as she covertly wiped away a tear, \"particularly when the fault has not been ours--we have always lived within your father's income, even though his practice has been falling off in these bad times, what with his getting up in years, and what with these young doctors trying to get in their hands everywhere. He tells me that he has never had to find fault with me for extravagance,\" she finished wistfully.  \"I should think not,\" said Annie emphatically. \"Why you have always been as simple as simple could be in your own tastes and habits, not a woman in your circle dresses more quietly. You have hardly even driven in the brougham when father was not wanting it, in case you should over-work the horse--you have always said, but I really believe that you chose to walk for the simple reason that many of your acquaintances had no choice. Nobody can ever reflect upon you, mother, for having wasted either father's means or other people's,\" said Annie, with a bright glance which became her infinitely.  \"Thank you, my love, for saying so,\" replied her mother gratefully; \"and you see it is as well that I did not accustom myself to driving, among other indulgences, for another of the retrenchments which your father mentioned was putting down the brougham. Yet how he is to manage his more distant patients on foot, at his age, I cannot imagine,\" she broke off in helpless distress, clasping her hands tightly together, according to a way she had. \"It seems downright madness to propose it.\"  \"Then you may be sure it will be prevented,\" said Dora with earnest trustfulness, as she gently patted her mother's cap. \"Nobody can ask a sacrifice from him which he is unable to make. Mother, do you know what I was thinking? that the only occasions on which you and father were regardless of expense have been where the profit or pleasure of us girls was concerned. You have given us every advantage you could get for us in the shape of education. You sent Annie and me to London to take these costly music-lessons;--Annie, I wish we had made more of them. You arranged that we should go on that foreign tour with the Ludlows.\"  \"We did our best for you--your father and I. I think I may say that,\" admitted Mrs. Millar simply.  Dora went on eagerly with her generous catalogue. \"There was the young artist who exhibits at the Academy and the Grosvenor, who was sketching at Nenthorn, you had him over at a high price once a week, and he condescended to help Rose with her drawing and painting. Then there was Mr. Blake, the university man whom father considered so far in advance of any classical master Miss Burridge could afford, he was induced so long as he was staying at Woodleigh to bring on May with her Latin and Greek.\"  \"So far so good,\" said Mrs. Millar, in her excitement borrowing one of her husband's brisk, cut and dry phrases. \"I hope you will reap the benefit of any effort we made, dears, because\"--she hesitated, and nearly broke down--\"well, I don't think you need mind so much your father's giving up this house and going into a smaller one; I'm sure I don't mind it at all when I think what other people will have to suffer; and as for you, why, you may not be here--not always, at least. We are afraid, your father and I, that you'll need to go and do something to keep yourselves.\"  \"To be sure,\" said Annie promptly. \"Don't trouble about that, mother; we'll be only too glad to be of use!\"  \"We'll be too thankful to relieve you and father as much as we can,\" said Dora in a voice soft and fervent, but less assured.  \"That will be the least trial,\" asserted Annie fearlessly.  \"Oh, you don't know what you're saying!\" cried Mrs. Millar, fairly giving way and permitting herself to sob for a minute or two behind her handkerchief. \"You are dear, good girls! I knew you would be, and so brave that I ought to take courage; but young people are so hopeful and inexperienced. I don't wish you to be unhopeful, of course, still you cannot tell what it is for your father and me to send our girls--our own girls whom we have been so proud and fond of, that have been making the old house brighter and brighter ever since they were born--out into a cold world, to have to struggle for a pittance, to lose their youth and its privileges, to be knocked about, and perhaps ill-treated, and looked down upon by people in every way their inferiors.\"  \"Don't, mother,\" interrupted Annie with decision; \"you're conjuring up bogies which have ceased to exist now-a-days. Think of the women who go out into the world by no compulsion, simply for the honour and pleasure of the thing, because they will not stay at home to lead idle, useless lives, when there is needful work to be done abroad. I don't question that they have difficulties to encounter, but I have yet to learn that staying at home will keep away crosses. Brave women can bear whatever trouble comes. I have often thought of such workers, if you will believe me\"--the girl was in a glow of animation--\"with both shame and envy. It is true I have not proposed to join them,\" she added in a lower tone, \"because I knew I was young for such work and not half good enough or clever enough, and because we were all so happy at home--you and father made us so,\" and Annie turned away her head, and forthwith came tumbling down a few steps from the exalted position she had taken up.  \"No, don't tell me, Annie Millar,\" said her mother with something like passionate resistance, \"that any good father or mother can be glad to send their young daughters out into the wide world to fight and suffer by themselves. It is not natural and it is not true. It is an altogether different thing to give them to good men who will take care of them and make them happy.\"  \"But if the good men are not forthcoming, or if they happen to be the wrong men,\" protested Annie. There was an irresistible twinkle in her dark eyes, in spite of the care and trouble that had come upon the household, which she was too sensible and warm-hearted a girl not to share fully.  Dora stood conscience-stricken and guilty-looking, until, as she stroked her mother's locked hands, she at last found words to put in her humble petition, \"We shan't all go away, mother dear. Father and you must let one of us stay to take care of you and cheer you?\"  \"Oh, my dear, we are not old enough, at least I am not old enough to accept such a boon, supposing we are very poor,\" said Mrs. Millar sadly, \"and in that case it might be sacrificing one of you, and spoiling your prospects in life.\"  \"No, no,\" cried Dora vehemently.  \"Dora means that one of us ought to stay at home to set your cap right,\" said Annie brusquely.  It sounded an inopportune jest, positively unfeeling. The truth was Annie still laboured under the common youthful necessity to hide her deeper feelings, an obligation made up of a touch of hysterical excitement, pride, shyness, and possibly the unsubdued buoyance of two-and-twenty years. The last is apt to rebound swiftly, with a mixture of cheerfulness and defiance from any sorrow, short of the one sorrow which cannot be trampled down or made light of, that has its root in a grave. Annie must find something to laugh at, to get fun out of, in the tribulation which she nevertheless felt in every nerve of her body, to the core of her heart.  \"I ought to be able to keep my cap straight,\" said poor Mrs. Millar very literally and meekly, looking a little puzzled by Annie's ill-timed nonsense, and apparent hardness. \"I daresay I should pin it, but the pins drag my hair so and hurt me.\"  \"Never think of it, mother,\" said mild Dora indignantly, looking daggers at Annie.  \"Of course I did not mean that, mother. I was not in earnest,\" Annie made the penitent amendment.  \"You are right to make the best of things,\" said Mrs. Millar, giving a little shivering sigh on her own account. \"It is the will of Providence. We are in God's hands, poor Mr. Carey and all of us, as we were a year ago--twenty years ago when you two were babies.\"  They were simple truisms which she uttered, but they were honest words, which meant a great deal to her. They borrowed impressiveness from the truthfulness of the speaker, in addition to the truth of the sayings, and by force of sympathy told on the listening girls, quieting and controlling them.  \"Poor Mr. Carey as you say, mother,\" Annie caught up the words. \"Well, I suppose the Careys will be in a far worse plight than we can be, and Cyril has been such a fool, though I don't suppose he meant much harm, with his dandyisms and idleness and his college airs--all that he has brought back from college.\"  \"Hush! child,\" exclaimed the elder, more tolerant woman. \"He has been a silly, selfish lad, but as he will know it now, to his cost, I do not like to hear you casting it in his teeth to-day. Perhaps it will steady him, and then this misfortune will be a blessing so far as he is concerned.\"  \"Rather hard that we should all be sacrificed to prop up Cyril's weak moral nature,\" muttered Annie.  \"And the Russells,\" suggested Dora. \"I have heard Colonel Russell speaking to father, as if he and the Rector also had to do with the bank. Oh! there is Ned Hewett, who has not passed his Cambridge examination any more than Cyril Carey. Not that it has been Ned's fault, or that he goes in for nothing save amusement, only he is so slow over his books, poor fellow! He will grudge his father's having spent money over him to no purpose more than ever now; and Lucy and Bell will be sorry for him--they are so fond of Ned.\"     CHAPTER V.  PROMOTION.   At that moment a rush was heard on the stairs, and Rose and May burst into their mother's room, Rose at the last moment bethinking herself that she had left school, accordingly she must be grown up, or on the brink of it, if Annie would but allow it, and therefore trying to moderate the headlong pace, which would have better become a troop of boys than a pair of girls.  \"Little May,\" who, in spite of her height, was still in frocks an inch from the ground, was not troubled by any such scruples. She scampered up to her mother, and hailed her breathlessly--\"Mother, we want you to let us--Rose and me--go with Ella and Phyllis Carey a walk to the Beeches. Ella says she saw some periwinkles and young ferns there, and we need, oh! ever so many fresh roots for the rockery. We should have gone without coming home to tell you, because you wouldn't mind, but we might have kept tea waiting, and we'll be horribly late. Besides, we are not coming home for tea; Ella and Phyllis say we must go up with them to the Bank House.\"  \"No, no, my dears, you can't do that,\" said Mrs. Millar, hurriedly but decidedly. \"I am sorry that you should be disappointed, but you must not think of such a thing. Ella and Phyllis don't understand--don't know--that their mother is particularly engaged this afternoon. She will not wish to have people in the house, not even in the schoolroom.\"  Rose and May looked in wonder at their mother, discomposed enough in her own person, sitting leaning back in her chair doing nothing; she whose motherly hands were wont to be busy with some little bit of sewing or knitting.  Annie, too, was sitting idle at a short distance, with her hat thrown on the bed, but still wearing her jacket; and Dora, in her walking dress, was standing like a lady-in-waiting, or a sentry, behind Mrs. Millar's chair.  Annie and Dora remained silent, looking at the intruders in a peculiar manner. At the same time the first pair did not tell the second more or less curtly, as the elder girls had been in the habit of doing not so very long ago, to go away and leave grown-up people to finish important discussions in peace.  What other new thing could have come about? Was there a fresh wooer in the field, a second offer of marriage to be laid at reluctant feet? Was it Annie, their beauty, who was in request this time? Who was the lover? not Cyril Carey, with his plush waistcoat and gold chains and odious snuff-box? He had no means of keeping a wife, unless his father took him into partnership in the bank, and their father would not hear of Cyril; besides, Annie held him in supreme disdain. She had more patience with Tom Robinson and \"the shop\" than with the nineteenth century dandy, whom she pronounced a mistaken revival of one of the many curiosities of Queen Anne's reign.  But Rose and May had no certainty that Annie was the object of pursuit. She was pretty enough, they had all pinned their faith to her beauty, yet already Dora had been preferred before her, though it was only by the head of \"Robinson's.\" Was it possible that now it might be Rose, unsuspecting, unconsulted? Could her own mother and sisters be so unfair as to arrogate to themselves the settlement of her affairs without her consent or knowledge, without so much as admitting her into the conclave?  Annie took the initiative, she was sufficiently quick to see both behind and before her. She had a head for directing and managing which her mother did not possess.  \"Mother, don't you see they had better be told at once?\" she said, with the aplomb of a girl who, however young and irresponsible, is capable of arriving at independent conclusions and reversing existing conditions. \"They are, as Rose says, all but grown up; indeed not so very much younger than Dora and I. I think Rose and May are entitled to be told.\"  Annie was proceeding to act upon the permission implied in her mother's nod. She was not without some small sense of personal importance in being the mouthpiece which was to announce the calamity to her younger sisters. She did it in a very different fashion from that in which their mother had broken the news to her and Dora.  \"What we are going to speak to you about is not a thing that can be long concealed. It will not be a secret for more than a few days, if for so long. But that does not mean that you are not to shut this room door which you have left wide open. Thanks, May. Don't bang it! You are not to show that you know what is going to happen. And, after it has happened, you are not to chatter about it before the servants or to your companions. We are trusting you because you have almost come to the years of discretion, and ought to have a notion how to behave under the circumstances.\"  \"Well, this is too bad of you, Annie!\" cried Rose, showing instant symptoms of revolt. \"What have May and I done that we should be spoken to as if we were a pair of tell-tales, or babies--and geese into the bargain? Dora and you are not so much older, as you confess; neither are you so much wiser with all your pretensions. If something of so much consequence to everybody is on the eve of happening, I think we might have been told before. Surely mother is not afraid that we should repeat anything which we ought not to mention,\" and she glanced with burning reproach at her mother.  Rose was both high-spirited and touchy. She was not disposed to play the second part without a murmur like Dora. She was not content, with her art as a balance to Annie's beauty and May's budding scholarship. Rose desired everybody to acknowledge her mother-wit and trustworthiness.  Dora and Mrs. Millar spoke together in reply. \"Mother only told Annie and me this afternoon,\" said the general peacemaker.  \"It was not such a pleasant piece of information for me to give, or you to receive, child, that you and May should grudge my keeping it from you as long as I could, as I dared,\" was the mother's weary reply. \"Besides, your father did not wish it spoken about before; it would have been wrong, a great risk to many others as well as to ourselves, to have mentioned such a thing.\"  \"Then don't tell us now if you don't care to, mother, and if father disapproves of our hearing it,\" said Rose magnanimously, for she was dying to be at the bottom of the mystery.  \"No, don't, mother dear, please don't, if it will hurt you,\" said May affectionately, with something of a childish ring in her voice. Her mother took her hand at the words and clasped it tightly.  \"Mother has made up her mind and father has given her leave to speak,\" said Annie with determination, \"because you must hear soon anyhow. There is something wrong with the bank, Mr. Carey's bank. We have all, even May, read and heard of bank failures, and have some idea how disastrous they are.\"  \"The Carey's bank!\" cried Rose, with sufficient intelligence in her astonishment. \"I understand now why we were not to go home with Ella and Phyllis.\"  \"Then somebody must run over and tell them that we are not coming,\" interrupted May. \"Do let Bella take the message, mother, in case I should look as if I knew something. Poor Mr. Carey! he was always so kind to us. I am so sorry; but the bank has not anything to do with us; father is not the banker, he is just a doctor like grandfather,\" ended May composedly.  \"O May, you are a baby, though you read the Greek Testament and have something to say to Tacitus in the original,\" exclaimed Annie indignantly.  \"Your father has shares in the bank, my dear,\" explained her mother with patient reiteration. \"He bought them with his savings, and he will get nothing for them. Nobody will buy them from him again, they will be no better than waste paper. But that is not the worst. The shares make him responsible for the bank's debts--I am sure I cannot tell you how far; he told me, I daresay, but I was so grieved for him and for all of you, and so confused, I could not take it in. But he says that what he will have to pay up will be as much as he can do, with a hard fight, for the rest of his days.\"  \"I am so sorry for father,\" murmured May in an awed tone, but with a little of a parrot note, just as she had pitied Mr. Carey, who was only an old acquaintance and the father of her friends. The fact was that the young girl, brought away suddenly from her girlish interests and her whole past experience, and plunged into the cares of older people, was thoroughly staggered and bewildered, in spite of a small head which was capable of construing Latin and conjugating Greek.  There was a moment's pause. \"Will it make a great difference to father and the rest of us?\" asked Rose, in spite of her quickness, and in spite of what her mother had said.  \"Certainly,\" Annie took it upon her to answer, with a mixture of fire and conviction, \"we'll all have to earn our living.\"  \"Oh, don't make such sweeping statements, Annie, frightening your sisters,\" said their mother reproachfully; and unquestionably May looked scared, and dropped her gloves without noticing it. \"You must do what you can to help your poor dear father, and I am sure you'll do that willingly, but so long as he is spared to work for all of us----\" She stopped short, unable to say any more.  Then her daughters closed round her, from the youngest to the eldest, and told her in concert that she was not to be concerned for them. They were ready for the occasion and equal to it, and they would not mind in the very least.  \"Mind!\" declared Rose, with her eyes beginning to shine and her cheeks to flush like Annie's. \"Why, it is the one great comfort that we'll have to make our way in the world, and push our fortunes like boys. We'll have plenty of adventures and rise triumphant over them all, and be such a help to you and father. Think of that, May, you little coward,\" appealing to her younger sister who, in spite of her small dabbling in masculine acquirements, did not look as if the prospect of pushing her fortune like a boy was full of unmixed charm for her. But she brightened up at the visionary honour and delight of being a great help to their father and mother, and cried, \"Yes, yes, Rose,\" with subdued enthusiasm.  Dora also echoed the \"yes\" with a quiet intensity.  Annie, on her part, graciously approved of her juniors, and rewarded them by patronizing them tremendously.  \"That is right. I don't very well know yet what Dora and I can do, but we'll find something. However, you two young ones are the geniuses of the family, and we'll look to you. I suspect Dora and I will have to march under your wings. You, Rose, must be quick and paint Academy pictures, get them hung on the line, and have them sold before the opening day. May must pass all her examinations in no time, gain a scholarship, and be appointed classical mistress to a Girls' Day-school, of which she will eventually become the head. Fancy 'little May' a full-blown school ma'am.\"  \"Dear! what creatures girls are! They are jesting and laughing already over their own and other people's misfortunes. It is little they know of life, it is little they guess what will befall them,\" sighed Mrs. Millar to herself. Nevertheless, in the middle of her anxiety and sorrow, she was in some respects a happy woman, and she had a dim but consoling perception of the truth.     CHAPTER VI.  THE CLOUD DEEPENS.   The storm burst, but the cloud did not disperse, it only closed in more darkly over Redcross. At the same time, as the bank authorities had foreseen, there was little or nothing of the wild, panic-stricken run on the capital which heralds and intensifies many a bank's fall. The losers went about their ordinary occupations. The Rector preached, presided over meetings of the vestry and Christian Associations, and attended to his sick. Doctor Millar looked after his sick. Colonel Russell even went to the Literary Institute and read the newspapers as usual. Every one of them wore his customary face, however abnormal the working of his heart. The Redcross victims, and many another innocent man besides, behaved like gentlemen, Englishmen, and Christians. There was neither outward fuss nor fury.  The individual who came nearest to breaking down was naturally Mr. Carey. The very forbearance with which he was treated cut to the quick the honest man who had been the tool of fools and knaves, brazening out their share of the business and contriving to escape with the least damage of anybody. They had been impecunious, trading upon other people's funds to begin with, and Carey's Bank's failure only left them where they were originally, under circumstances in which no reasonable person would expect redress from them. But poor James Carey, who had been credulous and weak, was made of other stuff.  \"I'm not easy about Carey,\" the little doctor confided to his wife. \"He was talking quite in a stupid, dazed way to Russell and me this morning. Do you observe his eyes? Have you noticed the veins on his forehead and his throat? I'm far from comfortable about him.\" (As if he felt comfortable about anything at this period!) \"I question much whether he'll ever get over it.\"  The public of Redcross, who could remark the glassy look of the eyes, though they might not be qualified to speak of the condition of the veins, were still more struck by the immediate and melancholy effect the bank's failure had on Mr. Carey, when their attention was drawn to Mrs. Carey's behaviour. She was a woman who had seldom left her house save for her daily drive, now she walked out with her husband every fine afternoon. Her arm was drawn through his; but it was evident at the merest glance that she was supporting his failing steps and not he hers. She was a little, thin, somewhat wizened woman, but she looked equal to the task she had set herself, if a strong will would do it. There was a peculiarity to be seen in her eyes too, by those who could read the sign. It was a fixed desperate determination to keep her husband and the father of her children by sustaining his weakness with her strength, to fight and vanquish the enemy whose icy touch was already on his heart and brain.  But although there was little outward demonstration in Redcross, much inner ferment and growing concern prevailed beneath the surface in what had been considered the principal houses in Redcross--houses safe and sure as they were honourable in their ascendancy in the past. After the affairs of the bank were in the hands of liquidators, and it became clear that the ruin was great and complete, hope had hardly a hole or corner left to linger in, even in the hearts of the most simple and sanguine. The impending changes which must follow became the talk of the town, extending to circles far beyond that on which the blow had fallen. Within the narrower limits, the anxious question what was to be done became the one engrossing, breathless subject of the hour.  Some of the reforms and retrenchments were marked by the spasmodic haste and severity which are apt to defeat themselves. These formed pendants to the spurts of grovelling distrust and quaking care for one's own welfare which caused Wilkins the butcher to send in his quarter's bill before it was due to Colonel Russell, and have the debt discharged within the hour. In like manner, Honeyman the grocer felt bound delicately to intimate to the Careys that he declined to give the family more than a week's credit. He was answered in a formally polite note from Mrs. Carey to the effect that she had not intended to ask for any longer credit thenceforth, but from that date she would pay ready money. These offensively defensive acts and vulgar tokens that times were changed got wind, and were discussed in awed, indignant whispers by the mass of Wilkins's and Honeyman's fellow-townsmen.  There was little need to remind the poor Careys of their altered circumstances, since it was in the Bank House that some of the spasmodic sweeping reforms referred to had at once been practised by Mrs. Carey. She had always been the ruling spirit in the house, and people now said openly that it would have been well for everybody if she had been the ruling spirit in the bank also. She was a woman with locally aristocratic connections, of a more tangible kind than what constituted the Millars' shadowy link with the county. Her brother was Sir Charles Luxmore of Headley Grange, and her nephew had allied himself to the peerage by marrying an Honourable Victoria Brackenridge. All the greater the glaring recklessness and insolence of Honeyman to take the word into his own mouth and refuse the Careys credit. At the same time Sir Charles's place was nearer the town of Nenthorn than that of Redcross, and he did not deal with Redcross tradesmen unless at election times. As for his daughter-in-law, the Honourable Victoria, she came so seldom to see her aunt-in-law that her face could not be said to be known in Redcross streets, where she never entered even the \"fancy shop\" which the other county ladies patronized occasionally in search of missing shades of silks or wools.  Mrs. Carey had stooped considerably when she became the wife of Mr. Carey of the bank, though the bank was nominally his own, and the Careys were a highly respectable family of old standing in Redcross. When it came to that, there had only been two generations of the Luxmores at Headley Grange, and the original baronet's rise to the honours of knighthood and a baronetage was due to his success and favour in high places as a fashionable physician. Mrs. Carey had not been very young at the date of her marriage, and her fortune was moderate enough, for the moneyed strength of her grandfather and father had gone to found a family and support a baronetage. Still, she had been accustomed to carry herself, after she became Mrs. Carey, not in an obtrusive and offensive manner, but in a quiet, well-bred way, as one who had been undeniably better born and bred than her neighbours. Indeed, under any circumstances she would have been a reserved woman, who would, in homely parlance, have kept herself to herself.  This was the woman who, with an absence of any sense of proportion, and an equal lack of humour, sometimes to be found in women of her class and character, together with an excess of mingled fiery zeal and feverish apprehension, hidden under a quiet exterior, took her measures on the very day after the bank's failure. These measures made a thorough exposure of the conclusion which she had arrived at, and subjected herself and the whole family to immediate privations, for which they were unprepared. They were injurious as well as useless and uncalled for, and had a ludicrous side. Acting for Mr. Carey, she dismissed the coachman and the gardener, paying them their month's wages which were unearned. She let the valuable horses take their chance of casual grooming and feeding, till they were sold off. She left the garden at the most critical time of the year, as the old gardener said with tears in his eyes, when the young vegetables were only coming into use, and the whole fruit would be lost unless it were properly seen to. The wood pigeons would have all the later seeds springing in the beds, and the place on which he had bestowed so much time and labour would lie waste, instead of providing a considerable part of the food of the household in summer and autumn. \"But there was never no sense in them ladies like missus, no more in their sparing than in their spending.\" At one fell swoop she dismissed her own maid, the cook, and the parlour-maid, retaining only a young table-maid to \"do\" for the family.  Mrs. Carey had hitherto been an indulgent mother, but all at once she told the scandalized university dandy and failure, Cyril, that he must brush his own boots and help his schoolboy brothers to clean the knives, if he were not satisfied with what a maid-of-all-work could accomplish in these departments.  As for Ella and Phyllis, looking on aghast at the wholesale destruction of what they had been accustomed to consider the ordinary comforts--not to say the luxuries and refinements of their home--the girls were informed that they were not to go back to Miss Burridge's, where their quarters were paid in advance. The younger brothers might continue at the Grammar School, because the fees were low; they would be kept out of harm, and they could do nothing else to speak of. But Ella and Phyllis had better lose no time in learning to make beds, sweep floors, and lay tables. \"For myself, I have your father to see to,\" said Mrs. Carey in her somewhat deep and strong voice, the measured steadiness of which had acquired a ringing vibration. \"I do not mean to conceal from you that Dr. Millar is apprehensive on your father's account, and I intend to devote myself to him. We must pull him through and save him at any cost, though his health and nerves may be shattered from this date, and he may never be able to retrieve his losses and those of other people, which, of course, press most heavily upon him. We can try at least for the credit as well as the life which is so dear to us, and never have it said for his sake, still more than for ours, that he was blind and imposed upon, and then let himself slip out of the misery which he had helped to bring about, while others who were not accountable were condemned to pay the penalty.\"  Mrs. Carey would fain not have touched a farthing of the income allowed the family till the bank's affairs were wound up--that winding-up which Dr. Millar said might last throughout his life. She would willingly have resigned the bulk of her small fortune in favour of the bank's creditors, but marriage settlements and trustees are stubborn facts to deal with. All she could do was to stint and punish herself and her family in the manner described, and inasmuch as the stinting and punishment were done in good faith, doubtless they would serve their purpose and have their reward.  The Rector was a widower. Hitherto he had kept an efficient housekeeper and chaperon for his daughters, the elder of whom must now take the housekeeper's place. He, too, put down what had served him for a carriage. It was remarkable how uniformly the first idea of retrenchment took this form in Redcross, but it was natural under the circumstances. It was difficult to say at once what was to be cut down from a not very extensive list of supernumeraries, unless one was prepared to make a clean sweep like Mrs. Carey. The Rector had been simple enough in his tastes and habits. He was a member of the Church of England Temperance Society, and so had no valuable cellar of wine to dispose of. He did not possess more silver plate than was wanted for the Rectory table. His library contained no rare and costly books. The very carriage in question was no more than one of those pony-phaetons with regard to which Bishop Pattison appealed, in one of his letters from Melanesia to his brethren in peaceful, pleasant country rectories and vicarages at home, asking the astonished clergymen, with their clergywomen in the background, if they really considered the clerical equipage, with its modest expense, equivalent to a divine institution? The Rector proved his freedom from the superstition by doing away with the phaeton and its pair, and falling back, as he was a spare man, on an old pony which the children had ridden by turns. Though he was not a book fancier, he had entertained a fondness for art, and since he could not indulge in much picture buying, had dabbled in old prints, of which he had rather a fine collection. This all at once vanished along with the phaeton.  Bell Hewett, the second daughter, who was several years younger than her sister Lucy, but had left Miss Burridge's some time before, and was as far removed from a school-girl as Annie Millar herself, unexpectedly appeared again on the familiar benches. She was not there as a junior governess, she was not sufficiently clever or educated, since Miss Burridge sought to work up to the new standards. Poor Bell was in her old place, in her old classes, as a pupil once more, only she sat looking deeply affronted, and nervously trying to make up for lost time, among a set of young girls like May Millar.  There was not much difference made in Colonel Russell's establishment. But this was caused by one of two things. There was the probability of the establishment's soon being broken up, if its master succeeded in getting a post which should enable him to return to India. On the other hand, the second Mrs. Russell was too foolish and self-willed to comprehend without a prolonged struggle how she and her babies could get along unless they were fortified by every imaginable aid in the shape of an expensive table, fine clothes, a couple of under nurses, and a boy in buttons. Fanny Russell, the Colonel's grown-up daughter by his first wife, looked sad enough over the prospect of her father's departure at his age, with his shattered constitution, and over what was to become of herself, left behind with the frivolous, unreasonable young stepmother with whom Fanny had never been able to agree.  The Millars were still in the old quaintly spacious house with its great bowery garden, for the plausible reason that Dr. Millar could not, on the spur of the moment, find a purchaser or an available tenant. He took some credit to himself for having more breadth of view and controlling common sense than poor Mrs. Carey, otherwise he might have rushed off and crammed his family into a small inconvenient house, for which, at the same time, he would have had to pay rent, that was not called for, unless in the form of rates and taxes, where his old house was concerned. There might be something to say on the other side of the question, but as yet that had not occurred to Dr. and Mrs. Millar. However, the Doctor's brougham, like the Rector's phaeton, was a thing of the past. He trudged manfully on foot to his patients. There are few evils which do not offer some compensations. It really seemed as if the Doctor's deprivation, which weighed heavily on his wife's mind, served to divert it from other trials, by the degree to which it was occupied in looking after her husband's changes of coats and boots, in order to ward off evil consequences to his health.  The four girls were so engrossed with what had happened and was going to happen to them from the failure of Mr. Carey's bank, that they had largely lost sight of the first wooer in the family. This was strong evidence of the extent to which their minds were filled by the rapid descent of what they called poverty on themselves and their neighbours. Rose and May ceased to have qualms of conscience when they caught sight of Tom Robinson fishing in the Dewes, not knowing what desperate promptings of despair might not suddenly lay hold of a rejected and forlorn lover. They left off glancing covertly at him in his pew at church, for the purpose of detecting the earliest symptoms of a broken heart and a galloping consumption. Instead they speculated on whether Bell Hewett would have had a new hat if it had not been for the bank's failure; and whether her brother's absence from home was owing to his having gone to London for the first look at the columns of the advertising newspapers, and that he might be on the spot to apply in person at the addresses given, and to haunt the agency offices, as young men are represented doing in novels.  Inevitably Tom Robinson's recent intercourse with the family had been confined to a formal call or two, awkward and unpleasant to all concerned. Only Dr. Millar brought him into the conversation occasionally, dealing with his name in the spirit of a faithful partisan. \"That good fellow Robinson did not draw out a farthing of his deposit at the bank after disquieting rumours must have reached him. Carey tells me that Robinson, in place of seeking to be reassured, did his best to reassure him, Carey; told him never to mind him, he could lie out of the money; he was willing to let others who had more need be paid first. Ah! well, it is good to have it in your power to be both just and generous, and it is still better to have a heart to use the power. Robinson has acted handsomely throughout, in short, like the gentleman he is. I wonder if his behaviour on this occasion will weigh with snobs against the iniquity of his having a shop. I thought Thackeray had done something to demolish similar rubbish when he described the young cads who gave the schoolboy Dobbin the nickname 'Figs.'\"  The speaker was guilty of glaring rather fiercely at his daughters, assembled for afternoon tea. They became eminently innocent and meek-looking on the instant, but when the sisterhood were left to themselves Annie delivered her opinion with admirable fairness and candour.  \"I am sure I am glad that Tom Robinson should behave himself like a gentleman, but that does not make his trade a profession fit for a gentleman, neither does it render the man, with his lack of ambition and his commonplaceness and dulness, an interesting specimen of humanity.\"  \"Not a man that a woman would care to die for,\" said Rose, wrinkling her forehead and crumpling up her nose till her face was half its natural length. \"Oh, I say, think of any woman being so infatuated as to be willing to die for an insignificant, foxy-headed, well-bred shopkeeper!\"  \"Don't be slangy, Rose,\" Annie rebuked her sister.  \"Still I am very glad,\" said Dora's soft voice quite distinctly, and while she blushed furiously she reared her little neck with an unconscious gesture. It said plainly, \"Yes, I am glad that the man who sought me for his wife has shown himself liberal and merciful, so that I can always think of him and his wishes with respect and gratitude.\"  \"And so am I glad,\" agreed May warmly. \"It is so nice that 'Robinson's' has not made its master grasping and greedy.\"  \"I don't know that rapacity is confined to trade,\" admitted Annie. \"You ought to know, May, for you have a good deal of intercourse with royalty in your reading; but I have a notion that it has been the distinguishing characteristic of a good many kings and emperors.\"  Annie and Rose had grown more and more eager to take up their burdens from the first day they were aware that there were burdens for them to take up. They were becoming positively enamoured of pushing their fortunes and encountering adventures--not in the least understanding, in spite of their bright wits, what the burdens, fortunes, adventures might mean. The two sisters' enthusiasm was just kept within bounds by two drags on its quicksilver quality. These laggard spirits, Dora and May, weighed upon their more enterprising companions. Neither could Annie and Rose quite shut their eyes to the increase of wrinkles on their father's face, and to their mother's red eyes when she came down of a morning. If it had not been for these small drawbacks, it is to be feared that Annie and Rose would have arrived at such a height of _tte exalte_ that they would have begun to rejoice in their own and their neighbours' misfortunes. There was something so fresh and exciting in looking about for openings and careers, in calculating how they were to earn their bread--which would taste so sweet to those who earned it--and at the same time save money. They were not quite so insane as to propose to amass fortunes and fling them into the gulf caused by the crumbling away of the late bank in order to redeem their father's pledge as a shareholder. But surely in the course of a year or two they might help him, and generally assist in keeping the old folks at home in state and bounty.  Annie and Rose looked on working for themselves in a very different light from that in which they regarded Tom Robinson's sticking to his father's and grandfather's shop. To be sure, they did not start with any intention of keeping shops. Even if they had done so, the descent might have been redeemed by a dash of sentiment and romance which did not apply in the least to a man with only himself to look to, a man of independent means to boot, who had forgotten what was expected from a gentleman.  There was no danger of Dora or May's being infected with their sisters' frame of mind. Dora and May were mortally ashamed of themselves. They feared they were not of the stuff of which heroines--not to say martyrs--were made. They looked back almost as fondly and sadly as their mother looked on the old state of matters. They dreaded with a shrinking terror going away from home, leaving their people, facing the cold, critical world, being left to their own slender resources. It was bad enough in Dora, but it was really dreadfully disappointing in May, with her youthful learning, to have so little spirit and courage; still so it was, and in the meantime there was no help for it. Dora might have been glad for purely personal reasons to get away from Redcross for a time; but she was not thrown into Tom Robinson's company, and the fact of his refusal had been kept so quiet by the Millars that, unless he himself betrayed it, which was not likely, the greatest gossip in the place could only suspect the truth.  It was a small comfort to the unheroic pair, and perhaps to Annie and Rose also, though they did not consciously take it into account, that all the older professional men in the town, the leaders and those who were on most intimate terms, were \"in the same boat,\" as Dr. Millar had said. But there was a family named Dyer lately settled at Redcross, a semi-retired stockbroker, with his wife and daughters, who had come from London to occupy Redcross Manor-house--naturally they had nothing to do with Carey's Bank, and were still supposed to be rolling in wealth, as they had been reported from the first. However, there was a notion that the Dyers' riches had not been acquired in any very refined fashion. Cyril Carey had always insisted, as he settled his collar and twirled his cane, that stockbroker was simply pawnbroker writ large. Anyhow the Dyers were not so distinguished in mind and manners as they were wealthy. Old conservative folks sighed at the idea of Redcross Manor-house, which had belonged to the Cliftons from time immemorial, till the last Clifton fell into the hands of the Jews before he was twenty, and was driven to break the entail by the time he was forty, passing to a family of Dyers. The best that could be said of them was, that the old people were comparatively inoffensive and the young were presentable. They were inclined to be friendly with the town--it might be till they could secure a footing with the county people, if that were possible. They dressed well, thanks to their milliners and dressmakers, kept a good table, a good stable, and a good staff of domestics, and furnished Redcross--especially young Redcross--with country-house hospitalities and gay gatherings, which they would otherwise have lacked. Yet fanatics of young people like Annie and Rose Millar, who were persuaded that they were now well acquainted with a reverse of fortune, began to behave as if they considered it was no longer the _crme de la crme_ of human experience to amass and retain a fortune. They began to pity the rampantly prosperous family for the lack on their part of any knowledge of life's vicissitudes, with their trumpet call to earnest effort and supreme self-devotion--all that makes man or woman worthy of the name. As for the younger Dyers, they were content to echo the sentiments of their mouthpiece, the head of their house. He spoke in the privacy of his family with a half-affable, half-contemptuous concern for those unfortunate beggars of uppish Redcross townspeople who had all come to smash by the failure of one paltry twopenny-halfpenny local bank.  The Millars were constantly hearing of fresh examples of hardship, and courage to meet the hardship, piquing and inciting them to enterprise and self-sacrifice on their own account. Now it would be May, who would come in from Miss Burridge's with a blanched face, crying, \"Oh! you girls, do you know Ella Carey has gone and is not coming back again? Phyllis is crying her eyes out, because she and Ella were never separated before. No, Ella has not gone to be a lady-help, as she thought she might do, after she had got a little more practice in washing dishes and peeling potatoes. It is nothing bad, except that she is gone for good and all, and it has been so sudden. And Mrs. Carey says Ella is not to come back. One of her sisters, the one without children, Mrs. Tyrrel, wrote and offered to take either of the girls. And what do you think Mrs. Carey said? That Ella must go, because if she went there would be a mouth less to feed. She was sorry, because she said it was giving up Ella, and she told her she must not expect to have much more to do with Phyllis and the rest of them at home, for it would be out of the question, in the different circumstances of the Tyrrels and Careys, for them to carry on frequent or intimate intercourse. Ella would have refused if she had dared, for she is so fond of Phyllis and all of them, even of her mother, though she has grown very hard since the bank failed. She used to let the girls have their own way. Don't you remember, Rose, she allowed us to dress up for charades out of her wardrobe? Why, you once wore her wedding-gown pinned up round you. But Mrs. Carey would not give Ella any choice. She repeated that there would be one mouth the less to feed. She said Ella was the elder, and it was her duty to her father and his creditors to go. So all poor Ella's things were sought out and packed up last night--the letter only came yesterday. She has had no time to bid Rose and me, or any of her other friends, good-bye. She started with Cyril early this morning, and I don't know what Phyllis will do without her.\"  \"She must do the best she can,\" said Annie promptly, \"and occupy herself with something better than gossiping with you when she chances to meet you coming from school. I suppose that was the manner in which you heard all this; I don't think Mrs. Carey will approve of such a waste of time.\"  \"But, Annie,\" pled May, with her dark eyes ready to brim over, \"poor Phyllis has only me now, and she has a great many messages to go, because their single servant has so much work to do in the house that she cannot get out marketing. Mrs. Carey is always walking or sitting with Mr. Carey. If it were not so, Phyllis is sure that her mother would go out and not mind taking the market-basket herself--a rough, heavy market-basket. The Careys' servants used to complain because one of them was expected to carry it in the mornings. Phyllis is glad to let me have it sometimes, her arms get tired and ache so. You see Jack and Dick are not often home from school in time, and then they have the boots and knives to clean. Cyril would carry it for her after it was dark, but Mrs. Carey won't let her go out then, and sends her off to bed that she may get up earlier for what she has to do in the morning.\"  That rough market-basket over which the Careys' former servants had grumbled, was like a badge of honour in certain shining eyes--far more so than Thirza Dyer's thoroughbred, or Camilla and Gussy Dyer's exquisite hats and dainty parasols. Even Annie Millar was not too old or too wise to refrain from wishing that Mrs. Millar, who still would not let her daughters soil their fingers if she could help it, had sent them out marketing in their native town, each in her turn flourishing a market-basket.  At another time it would be Rose who would arrive flushed and breathless with the great piece of news that Ned Hewett had taken the post of station-master at a small station somewhere on the Yorkshire moors. He had done it when nothing else turned up, without waiting to consult his father. But the Rector had not forbidden him when he heard. Steadiness and punctuality had always been Ned's strong points, so that, though he had not taken his degree at the university, and his old masters had said they were not surprised to hear it, he might be trusted not to wreck trains, slay their passengers, and find himself tried for manslaughter. The difficulty was to fancy a big, slow fellow like Ned rushing here and there in a noisy, fussy little station. After all, it would only be noisy and fussy at long intervals, and on rare occasions, \"somewhere on the Yorkshire moors.\" Ned might have time and space to walk about in. But what of the uniform? Would the poor boy--they had all known him as a boy--who had once cherished the notion of going into the army, have to wear a railway company's coat and a station-master's cap? How funny it sounded! Well, not altogether funny. There were Dora and May crying at the bare anticipation. If they were ever on the Yorkshire moors, and had to greet Ned in this extraordinary guise, it would be awkward for all parties, to say the least. What were they thinking of? Of course they would be proud to greet him when he was twice the man that he had ever been. No doubt Cyril Carey would be glad to have Ned's chance; Cyril, who had renounced his delicate plush vests and Indian gold chains and charms, his loitering and dawdling, and taken to a shabby shooting-suit and spade-husbandry. He was getting rid of his time and keeping out of his mother's way by digging aimlessly in the garden. He was inquiring, in a desultory fashion, all over Redcross for any opening in an office which he could fill. He was not likely to find such an opening unless it were made for him out of charity. He had not been trained to office work, and he was far from having Ned Hewett's reputation for steadiness and punctuality. If Tom Robinson should be the charitable man and ask Cyril, a schoolfellow and college chum, to help him with his accounts, the head of \"Robinson's\" would have to be at the trouble of running up every column of figures over again. Cyril might ride to hounds and row in a boat-race with the best; he might even have some elegant acquaintance with the renaissance and old French, and be capable of distinguishing himself in stately Latin verse, though that sounded more than doubtful when he had been plucked at his university--the inhabitants of Redcross did not, as a rule, pretend to be judges in such matters. What they did know, because it had oozed out some time before, was that Cyril Carey, though a banker's son, was lamentably weak in arithmetic, and his handwriting would have been held a disgrace to any shop-boy.  Money was required to start lads in the world in the humblest fashion. Ned Hewett wanted an outfit, and if possible furniture for his station-house, that he might not begin on credit. Even girls, though they had been a good deal set aside in such consideration, could not enter on an independent career without money any more than boys could. The Millars were therefore thankful that Mrs. Millar had a little money of her own, not above a hundred and fifty pounds a year, settled upon her from the first, by one of those marriage contracts which are so hard to break, and she could use it to supply what was needed for the girls, who were going into the world with such dauntless spirits and light hearts.     CHAPTER VII.  ROSE GOES WEST AND ANNIE GOES EAST.   In the end it was settled, to Annie and Rose's great satisfaction, and no less to the temporary relief of Dora and May's quaking hearts, that the two former were to take the first plunge into unknown waters. If things had been as they were formerly, and there had been leisure to spare from rougher rubs for highly delicate considerations, it might, as has been hinted, have been held that Dora should have been the sister selected to go away from Redcross--at least for a time.  But a great deal had happened since Tom Robinson's unsuccessful suit and all connected with it had been in honour hushed up. People had too many weighty matters to think of to keep in mind that small sentimental episode between a couple of young people.  Rose's fate was chalked out from the first. She was to be an artist--that went without saying. She had certainly artistic talent, she might have genius. But though she had been tolerably well trained so far, by a good drawing-master at Miss Burridge's, and by the lessons she had received from the wandering exhibitor at the Academy and the Grosvenor, neither she nor her family could be sufficiently infatuated to imagine she wanted no more teaching. Their conceptions of art might be crude, and their faith in Rose unbounded, but they did not suppose that she had only to open her portfolio and sell its contents as often as it was full. Dr. and Mrs. Millar made up their minds, Rose agreeing with them, that she should have at least a year in a London studio.  All the three considered it very fortunate when the artist who had given her lessons at Redcross, hearing of her intention, and of what had rendered it incumbent on her to work for her living, not only recommended a studio in which art classes were held, but good-naturedly gave her a testimonial and helped her to a post as assistant drawing-mistress in a ladies' school, a situation which she could fill on two days of the week, while she attended the art classes on the remaining four. The salary thus obtained was of the smallest, but it would supplement Mrs. Millar's allowance to Rose, and help to pay her board in some quiet, respectable family living midway between the school and the studio. Rose was a lucky girl, and she thought herself so. Indeed that minimum salary raised her to such a giddy pinnacle in her own estimation that it nearly turned her head. It was only her sisters, the wise Annie among them, who regarded the assistant drawing-mistress-ship with impatience as a waste of Rose's valuable time and remarkable talents.  A qualification came soon to Rose's exultation and to her pride in being the first of her father's daughters--and she the third in point of age--who had just left school, and had hardly been reckoned grown-up by Annie till quite lately--to earn real tangible money, gold guineas, however few. For something better still befell Annie. If Rose was lucky, Annie was luckier. True, she would never be a great artist, she would never get hundreds and thousands for a picture. At the utmost she would only be at the head of a charitable institution. She might save the greater part of her income then, and hand it over to her father, but that was a very different prospect from the other. Still, from the beginning Annie would be, so to speak, self-supporting; she need not cost her mother or anybody else a penny, her very dress would be provided for her. Above all Annie was going to do a great deal of good, to be a comfort and blessing, not only to her people, but to multitudes besides. She was, please God, to help to lessen the great crushing mass of pain and misery in the world, not by passive, sentimental sympathy, not by little fitful, desultory doles of practical aid, but by the constant daily work of her life. Young as Rose was, and enamoured of art in her way, she was able to comprehend that if Annie could do that worthy deed, her life would be greater in a sense, fuller in its humanity, perhaps also sweeter than that of the most famous and successful painter.  Annie had always taken a lively interest in her father's profession, and he had liked her to do so. He had been fond of talking to her about it, and enlightening her on some of its leading principles. He had even pressed her into his service in little things, and been gratified by the hereditary firmness and lightness of grasp and touch, the control over her own nerves and power of holding those of others in check, the quick and correct faculty of observation she had displayed. But with all his loyal allegiance to the calling which had been his father's before it was his, which he would have liked to see his son fill, if a son had been born to him, he was taken aback and well-nigh dismayed, as her mother was, when Annie came and told them quietly that she had made up her mind, if they would consent, to go into an hospital and be trained for a nurse. He laid before her as calmly and clearly as he could the conditions of the undertaking, and reminded her that it could not be gone into by halves, while he thought, as he spoke, that Annie was not the style of young woman to go into anything by halves.  Mrs. Millar followed with a trembling recital of the painfulness, the absolute horror to a young girl of many of the details of the office. But Annie was not shaken in the least. \"I should not mind that,\" she asserted with conviction. \"I know there must be strict discipline and hard trying work, with no respite or relaxation to speak of; but I am young and strong, fitter to stand such an ordeal than most girls of my age are qualified. I am too young, you say? Yes, I admit that; it is a pity--at least I know I have always reckoned myself too young when the thought crossed my mind six months--a year ago, of leaving home and becoming trained for a nurse.\"  \"You don't mean to say, Annie, that you ever thought of going out into the world before our misfortunes in connection with the bank?\" cried both father and mother in one breath.  Annie hung her shapely head a little, then held it up, and confessed frankly, \"Yes, I have. Oh, you must forgive me. It was not from any failure of kindness on your part, or, I trust, any failure on mine to appreciate your kindness, for I believe you are the best, dearest father and mother in the world,\" she cried, carried out of herself, and betrayed into enthusiasm. \"But what were you to do with a houseful of girls, when one would have served to give you all the help you need, mother, in your housekeeping and the company you see? I _have_ hated the idea of being of no use in the world, unless I chanced to marry,\" ended Annie, with a quick, impatient sigh.  \"My dear, you are talking exaggerated nonsense.\" Mrs. Millar reproved her daughter with unusual severity, dislodging her cap by the energy of her remonstrance, so that Annie had to step forward promptly, arrest it on its downward path, and set it straight before the conversation went any further. \"Nobody said such things when I was young. I was one of a household of girls, far enough scattered now, poor dears!\"--parenthetically apostrophizing herself and her youthful companions with unconscious pathos--\"I would have liked to hear any one say to us, or to our father and mother, that we were no good in the world. I call it a positive sin in the young people of this generation to be so restless and dissatisfied, and so ready to take responsibilities upon themselves. It is a temptation of Providence to send such calamities as the one we are suffering from. You will know more about life when you are forced to work for yourself, and do not set about it out of pure presumption and self-will, with a good home to fall back upon when you are tired of your fad.\"  Mrs. Millar had been hurt and mortified by Annie's avowal. She had been further nettled by the slighting reflection on a houseful of girls, made by one of themselves, while she, their mother, the author of their being, poor unsophisticated woman! had always been proud of her band of bright, fair young daughters, and felt consoled by their very number for the lack of a son.  \"Come, come, mother,\" said Dr. Millar, \"you must make allowance for the march of ideas.\"  \"I cannot help it,\" said Annie, with another quick sigh. \"I suppose girls are not so easily satisfied as they once were, or they have been taken so far, and not far enough, out of their place. I could not have remained content with tennis-playing and skating, or _rchauff_ school music, French and German, or fancy work, however artistic--not even with teaching once a week in the Rector's Sunday-school--for my object in life. But after the way in which things have turned out, there is no need to discuss former views. Mother dear, it is surely well that I had not a hankering after idleness, after lying in bed half the forenoon, as people say the Dyers do, getting up only to read the silliest and fastest of novels, with secret aspirations after diamonds and a carriage and pair, if not a coach and six. Of course I should not have been contented with a one-horse shay, a mere doctor's pill-box, such as you have put down, father, which Rose and May are determined to set up for you again before they are many year's older.\"  \"Good little chits!\" exclaimed the little Doctor, blowing his nose suspiciously. \"Tell them, Annie, that I like walking above all things. I find it a great improvement on driving. I have been troubled with--let me see, oh! yes, cold feet--a deficiency in the circulation, not at all uncommon when one gets up in years, and after walking a bit I feel my toes all tingling and as warm as a toast.\"  \"I should prefer nursing to any other mode of earning my living,\" said Annie, keeping to her point. \"I may be presumptuous, like the girls of my day, as mother says, but I really think that I have a natural turn for nursing, derived from you father, and grandfather, no doubt, which might have made me also a good doctor supposing I had been a man, or supposing I had sought from the first to be a medical woman and had been educated accordingly. If I am wrong, you will set me right, won't you?\"  In place of contradicting her, he simply nodded in acquiescence, while he linked his hands across the small of his back.  \"Mother, I do not think I should shrink from dressing wounds, if I only knew the best thing to do to avoid danger and give relief. You remember when Bella burnt her arm badly from the elbow to the wrist, I tied it up to keep out the air, before father came in, and he said it was rightly done, and would not change the dressing. And when poor Tim, who has lost his place with the putting down of the brougham, gave his hand the terrible hack with the axe in breaking wood for cook, I was able to stop the loss of blood, and did not get in the least faint myself. Yes, I know it would be very pitiful to see a human creature die whom we could not save,\" she added, in a lower tone, \"and very sad to prepare such a one for the grave. But, dear mother, somebody has to do it at some time, and I may be the somebody one day, anyhow I shall have to be indebted to my neighbour to do the last charitable offices for me. It might be all the easier to look forward to in my own case if I had done it for other people, not merely because they were my own, just because they were God's creatures, and He had set me, among other women, to do the sorrowful work, and would lend me strength for the task.\"  \"I believe it, Annie,\" said Dr. Millar firmly, as he looked at the reverently bent head, and listened to the faltering yet faithful words.  Mrs. Millar said no more, though the poor lady still shivered, as she looked at the girl in her brilliant youthful bloom. It was too terrible to think of her associated with disease and death, she whom her father and mother would have sheltered from every rough wind. Yet what was pretty Annie in the ranks of humanity, in the march of history? The frivolous product of a heathen world, the feminine counterpart of some      \"Idle singer of an empty day\"?  or--      \"A creature breathing thoughtful breath,      A traveller 'twixt life and death\"--  a Christian girl who with all true Christians had the Lord Christ, who went about doing good, for an everlasting example? And had there not all along been something fine in Annie, under her superficial hardness and inclination to conceal her feelings, something which her family had not suspected, brought to light by their troubles? something of which everybody connected with her would be prouder in all humility, with reason, in the days to come, than they had ever been proud of her supreme prettiness and lively tongue in times past.  \"It is a pity about my age,\" went on Annie ingenuously, lamenting over her deficiency in years as other people lament over their superfluity in that respect, \"but it is a fault which will mend every day. I have found out that there are two hospitals which make twenty-three--just a year older than I am--the age of admission for probationers, and there is one hospital that admits them at twenty. Would not the fact of my being a doctor's daughter go for something? Have you not interest, father, if you care to exert it, to get the hospital authorities to stretch a point where I am concerned? You might tell them that I am the eldest of the family,\" drawing up her not very tall figure, \"that I have been treated as grown-up for years and years, and that I have several younger sisters whom I have tried to keep in order.\" There was a returning twinkle in Annie's brown eyes and a comical curve of her rosy lips.  But she relapsed into extreme gravity the next moment; indeed, she was more agitated than she had yet been, and for Annie to betray an approach to tearfulness was a rare spectacle.  \"There is something worse than my age. I am afraid I am not half good enough. I have a hasty temper; you have frequently said so, mother. I often speak sharply, and am not always aware when I am doing it. I hurt people, as I hurt myself, without being able to help it--something seems to come over me and impel me to do it. Often I cannot resist making game of people. I am so silly and fond of fun, like a child, a great deal worse than 'little May' ever is, when the fit is upon me. Now, if I could think that I should lose patience with poor sick people, and wound instead of comforting them, or that I should find them food for my love of the ridiculous, and forget and neglect their wants in following my own amusement, I should hate myself--I would die sooner than so disgrace a nurse's calling.\"  \"You would not do it, my dear,\" said Dr. Millar, with calm conviction.  \"Why, what treason is this you are speaking against yourself?\" cried Mrs. Millar, bristling up in her daughter's defence, the assailant being that daughter. \"You unkind or unfeeling when there was any call for kindness--whoever heard of such a thing? I should as soon suspect Dora of harshness or levity in the same circumstances. Don't you remember my bad eyes last winter, when I had to get that tincture dropped into them so often that your father could not always be at home to do it? You dropped the tincture as well as your father could, and though I know I must have made faces wry enough to frighten a cat, you never vouchsafed a remark, and I did not hear the ghost of a laugh. Poor Dora was ready to read to me by the hour, and to fetch and carry for me all day long, but when she tried to drop the tincture her hand shook so that she sent the liquid down my cheeks; and she was so frightened for giving me pain that I could see when I opened my eyes she was as white as a sheet, and fit to faint herself.\"  \"Dora's hand will get steadier and her heart harder by and by,\" said Dr. Millar, laughing. \"Not that she has the knack of the operator, any more than you have, Maria. I don't think one of you has it, except Annie here.\"  \"That was nothing,\" said Annie quickly. She added in a lower tone, \"And oh, mother, how could you imagine that I should laugh at your pain?\"  \"It was only for a moment, and I daresay it was not agonizing, as I was tempted to call it; very likely your father and you would not have so much as winced at it. Then there was Miss Sill, poor old Miss Sill. Annie, I am afraid you girls laughed at her. Girls will be girls, and she does dress outrageously. You all said her mantles were worse than my cap,\" tenderly touching that untrustworthy piece of head-gear. \"When she sent for your father all of a sudden, just when he had been summoned to Dr. Hewett's brother, who was very ill, as we knew, while we thought Miss Sill had only one of her maiden-lady fancies, your father told you to go over and say he would be with her in the course of the day. But you found her nearly choking with bronchitis. How you were not frightened out of your senses, I, who am a great deal more than twice your age, and the mother of a family, cannot tell. You propped her up in exactly the right position, saw to the temperature of the room, and caused her cook to bring in the kitchen boiler and set it to steam on the hob, before another doctor could be found. Miss Sill told me all about it afterwards; she believes she owes her life to you.\"  \"Oh, nonsense,\" protested Annie, \"I was a little better than her two servants, who stood looking at her, and beginning to sob and cry; but I made several gross mistakes. You told me about them afterwards, father; it was a great mercy that I did not cause her death.\"  \"So far from that,\" continued Mrs. Millar, in triumphant defiance, \"she calls you her young doctor to this day, and says she will send for you in preference to your father or any other doctor the next time she has an attack.\"  \"Infatuated woman!\" declared Annie.  \"I have not needed to talk to you in order to get you to go with your sisters and see her since then. You have gone of your own accord twice as often, and I am sure you have not laughed at her half so much. In fact, I believe you are becoming quite attached to her.\"  \"I suppose I am grateful to her for not dying in my unskilled hands. I am afraid I still think her rather fantastic and foolish; but it does make a difference in one's judgment of a person to have really rendered him or her a service. I ought to be fond of Miss Sill, after all, if she is to rank as my first patient.\"  Mrs. Millar sank into silence on the instant. She stood convicted in her own eyes. What had she been doing? Proving to her daughter's satisfaction that she had the special talents of a nurse!  \"I am very glad that mother and you think me--not by any means good enough, of course, not that, but not too impatient, sarcastic, and trifling to be a nurse,\" said Annie brightly, addressing her father, who simply acquiesced in an absent-minded fashion.  After that there was no serious objection made to Annie's wish, great as the wonder was at first--a shock to her relations no less than to her acquaintances. The former reconciled themselves sooner to it than did the latter, with an entire faith in Annie and an affectionate admiration which was genuine homage. It swelled Dora's heart well-nigh to bursting with sister-worship. How good Annie was showing herself, how capable of great acts of self-denial and self-consecration, while she was prettier than ever with her graceful head, her merry brown eyes, and that soft, warm colour of hers!  Only Mrs. Millar lay awake at night and cried quietly over what lay before her young daughter, her first-born, the flower of the flock, as people had called her in reference to her beauty. Annie's pretty Grand-aunt Penny had at least enjoyed her day; she had had her triumph, however short-lived, in marrying the man of her heart, who was also a Beauchamp of Waylands, and in being raised for even a brief space to the charmed circle of the county. What she had to go through--whether she would or not--in the end, was not worse than Annie was proposing to encounter in the beginning, to live in an hospital, to spend her blooming life amidst frightful accidents, raging fevers, the spasm of agony replaced by the chill silence and stillness of death. Annie's father's time and strength had been given in much the same cause, ever since he was a young man passing his examinations and taking his diploma. But he was a man, which changed the whole aspect of affairs; besides he had always had a cheerful home to come back to, with the command of all the social advantages which Redcross, his native town, could afford. He had not lived among his patients with no life to speak of separate from theirs.  At the same time Mrs. Millar felt herself powerless. She dared no more interfere to keep back Annie from her calling than a good Roman Catholic mother would forbid her daughter's \"vocation.\"     CHAPTER VIII.  STANDING AND WAITING.   It was all over in its earlier stages, that dividing and dispersing of the goodly young group of sisters, that bereaving and impoverishing of the abandoned home to which Dora and May had looked forward with such fear and pain, for which all Dr. Millar's fortitude and all his wife's meekness had been wanted to enable them to bear it with tolerable calmness. It was only Annie and Rose doing what every young man, with few exceptions, has to do. It was only their going away to work out their bents in London. They had often gone from home and followed various impulses and promptings before. But this was different. All who were left behind had a sure intuition that this was the beginning of the end, the sifting and scattering which every large family must undergo if their time is to be long on earth. Annie and Rose might often come back on visits. Rose might even set up a studio in Redcross and work there, but it would not be the same. She would be an independent member of society, with her own interests to think of--however faithfully and affectionately she might still be concerned for the interests of others--and her individual career to follow. Her separate existence would no longer be merged in that of a band of sisters; it would stand out clearly and distinctly far apart from the old state of tutelage and subserviency of each unit to the mass. The lament of the tender old Scotch song over the departing bride applied equally to Annie and Rose, though there were no gallant \"Jamies\" to accuse of taking them \"awa', awa'.\" In the same manner it was not so much over the cause of their going that Dora and May lamented, or the father and mother's hearts were sorrowful, as      \"Just that they'd aye be awa', awa'.\"  One day as May was coming back from school she met Tom Robinson, and he stopped her to ask how the family were, and to tell her something. There had always been less restraint in his and May's greetings than there had been in those of the others since his dismissal as a suitor. There was something in May's mingled studiousness and simplicity, and in the strong dash of the child in her, which dissipated his shyness and tickled his fancy. If matters had turned out otherwise than they had done, he told himself vaguely, he and \"little May\" would have been a pair of friends. He had no sister, and she had no brother, and he would have liked to play the brother to this most artless of learned ladies. \"Look here, Miss May,\" he said, after the usual formulas, while he turned and walked a few paces by her side, \"do you remember the fox-terrier puppy I was to have got for you and your sister Rose, in the spring? Well, he died of distemper, poor little brute; but I have heard of another of the same kind that has had the complaint. I could get him for you if you cared to have him.\"  \"Oh! I am so much obliged to you, Mr. Robinson, so very much obliged,\" cried May, beaming with gratitude and pleasure. \"Rose and I did so wish to have that dear little puppy which you brought down to show to us once--don't you remember? and so it is dead, poor little pet; and Rose has gone away to London to be regularly trained as an artist, just as Annie is in St. Ebbe's learning to be a nurse. I suppose you have heard,\" she ended a little solemnly.  \"Yes, I have heard--let me carry these books for you a bit--what is there of Redcross news that one does not hear?\" Then he paused abruptly, while there darted simultaneously across his mind and May's whether his speech did not sound as if he thought that Dora Millar's refusal of him must be public property? \"For that very reason,\" he went on with a momentary shade of awkwardness, \"I mean, because two of your sisters are gone, I fancied you might like this other little dog to keep you company.\"  \"I have Dora,\" said May simply, and then she dashed on in an unhappy consciousness that she ought not to have mentioned Dora's name to him on any account. \"I should like it immensely though--thank you a hundred thousand times, it was so good of you to think of me. But Rose could not have it now, could she? and she wished it quite as much as I did. It does not seem nice to have it when she is not here to share it,\" finished May, with wistful jealousy for Rose's rights in the matter.  \"I do not see the force of that objection,\" said Tom Robinson, cheerfully. \"Rose has something else instead. She has all London to occupy her. I am certain she would like you to make the best of Redcross without her.\"  \"Yes, and of course the little dog would be half hers, the same as if Rose were here. She would see it every time she came home. She might have her turn of it at her studio, when she gets a studio. In the meantime I could write full particulars of it, how it grew and what it learnt. Oh, Mr. Robinson, has it white boots like the other you brought?\"  \"I am afraid I did not attend to his boots, or to his stockings either for that matter,\" said Tom with a laugh; \"but he has a coal-black muzzle, his teeth are in perfect order, and I believe he has the correct tan spots.\"  \"If mother would let us,\" said May longingly. \"You know Rose and I had not spoken to her about it; we were waiting for a good opportunity to ask her, when you were so kind as to give us the chance of having the other little dog. Mother seldom refuses us anything which she can let us have, still Rose was not sure that mother would give her consent. You see she is troubled about the stair-carpets and the drawing-room rugs, and the garden-beds, and we were afraid she would think we should have the dog with us everywhere.\"  \"Then it rested with yourself, I should say, to show her that you could keep a dog in his proper place.\"  \"But I doubt if I could,\" said May candidly, shaking her head, with the brown hair which had till recently hung loose on her shoulders, now combed smoothly back, and twisted into as \"grown-up\" a twist as she could accomplish the feat; while to keep the tucked-up hair in company, her skirt was let down to the regulation length for young ladies. \"Indeed, I am almost certain I could not refuse anything to a dear little dog coming to me and sitting up and begging for what he wanted. What is more, if I could Dora couldn't.\" She could have bitten out her tongue the next instant. What was she doing always speaking of Dora? What would he think? That she was wilfully dragging her sister's name into the conversation? And what had tempted her to say that Dora could not refuse anything to a dog, when she had refused her heart in exchange for his to the man walking beside May?  He made no remark. If his mouth twitched a little in reproach or sarcasm, she could not see it under his red moustache; besides, she dared not look at him.  \"I wonder,\" continued Miss Malapropos, \"how I could let you know what mother thought.\" She never once suggested his bringing the dog for inspection, as he had brought the other, or calling for her answer.  \"You might drop me a note,\" he said, stopping to give her back her books, \"and I hope for your sake that it may be favourable, for this is a nice little dog, and I think you would like him.\"  May went home more nearly on the wings of the wind than she had done since Rose's departure, and presented her petition. Mrs. Millar could not find it in her heart to refuse it, though the stair-carpet, the drawing-room rugs, and the garden-beds were all to be sacrificed.  \"Poor little May! she misses Rose, though Dora and May have become great friends of late. Dora is very good, and puts herself on an equality with May, as Annie could not have done. Still, she does not rouse the child as Rose roused her. What do you think, Jonathan? Would a little dog be in your way? Would its barking disturb you?\" Mrs. Millar appealed to her husband.  \"Not in reason, Maria; not if it does not take to baying at the moon, or yelping beyond bounds. Dora gives in too much to May, in place of taking the child from her books, on which naturally she is inclined to fall back. Dora has become her audience, and listens to her performances--even aids and abets them. I caught them at it yesterday. First May actually declaimed several paragraphs from a speech of Cicero's, and next she got Dora to repeat after her the most crabbed of the Greek verbs. I shall have a couple of blue-stockings, and what is worse, one of them spurious, in the room of the single real production I reckoned upon among my daughters. By all means let May have a howling monster. She is not too old for a game of romps; and I must say, though I have never opposed the higher education of women, I don't want her cultivated into a gossamer, a woman all nerves and sensations, before she is out of her teens.\"  \"Do you suppose Tom Robinson can still be thinking of Dora?\" suggested Mrs. Millar dubiously.  \"I wish he were,\" said the little Doctor, ruefully. \"I wish he were. Yes, Mrs. Millar, I am sufficiently mercenary or sordid, or whatever you like to call it, where one of my daughters is concerned, to give expression to that sentiment. But I should say he is not, unfortunately. Robinson is a shy man, and, no doubt, proud after his fashion. It must have taken a great effort--premature, therefore mistaken, according to my judgment--for him to screw himself up to the pitch of proposing for a girl of whose answering regard he was uncertain. Having made the blunder and paid the penalty, he is not at all likely to put his fate to the touch again, so far as Dora is concerned. He is not the style of pertinacious, overbearing fellow who would persecute a woman with his attentions and ask her twice. Poor Dora has lost her chance, I take it.\"  \"I cannot say that I think it any great loss, to this day,\" answered Mrs. Millar, stubbornly. She gave a toss of her head, of such unusual spirit, that it so nearly dislodged her cap. Dr. Millar involuntarily put out a finger and thumb to lay hold of the truant. \"We have our worldly losses, to be sure, and the other poor dear girls have gone out into the world very cheerfully. I must say I could not have done what they have done with so good a grace--so heroic a grace, not to save my life, Jonathan. But that is not to say that they are to be in haste to marry--tradesmen. Indeed, when I come to think of it, the fact of their being so independent and able to provide for themselves, ought to be like having so many fortunes. It should entitle them to be more particular, and free to pick and choose the husbands who exactly suit them. Another thing, if our daughters are not worthy of being wooed and wooed, and asked--not twice, but half a dozen times, before they are persuaded to say yes, I don't know who is. The idea of their jumping at any man!--you have drawn me into vulgar language, Jonathan,--the moment he makes his bow is too bad or too good, I do not know which to say. You do not mean that I ever accustomed you to such forward behaviour?\"  \"No, no, Maria,\" the gentleman assured her with a smile, \"far from it. There was a bad epidemic raging at the time our little business came off, don't you remember? I forget now whether it was small-pox or scarlet fever, but I know I was not only tremendously busy, I dared not go to your father's house. Then I heard that another swain--an officer fellow from the barracks at Craigton was hanging about either you or your poor sister Dolly, nobody could tell which, and I dared not delay longer. I was driven to the supreme rashness of committing my suit to paper, and what do you think you wrote back? Have you forgotten? You thanked me very prettily for the compliment I had paid you, and you promised to give the substance of my letter your best consideration. Literally that was all--to a man worn off his feet with work and hungering for a word of assurance.\"  \"Go away with you, sir,\" exclaimed his wife, restored to high good humour, and tapping him on the shoulder. \"You understood me perfectly--you had wit enough for that. You went off directly and ordered new drawing-room furniture, what we have to this day, on the strength of that letter--you know you did.\"  \"Showed how far gone, and what a confiding simpleton I was,\" he said, and then he tried again to set her right with regard to Tom Robinson. \"You don't understand Robinson, Maria. It is not that he was not in earnest, or that he is fickle or anything of the kind. It is rather a case of the better man being beaten, and fools rushing in where angels fear to tread. Such men as he is accept a sentence without disputing it, because they do not think too much of themselves while they think a great deal of other people. It is not a flaw in their sensitive manliness, it is part and parcel of it, to know when they are dismissed, and take the dismissal as final. They are not the most light-hearted and sanguine of mortals, but they are constant enough, and brave enough to boot, and a brave man is not without his compensations--      \"'For sudden the worst turns the best to the brave,'  \"some poet has written.\"  \"So much the better,\" said Mrs. Millar, again with a suspicion of hauteur in her voice. \"It is lucky for all parties, since I have not the slightest reason to suppose that Dora would change her mind.\"  \"Then why find fault with poor Tom Robinson?\" Dr. Millar remonstrated in vain.  The appearance of the dog on the scene with his fine pointed nose, alert eyes, incessantly vibrating little tail, and miniver black and white coat picked out with tan, caused May as much excitement and delight as if she did not know one Greek letter from another, and were innocent of Latin quantities. She was so wrapped up in her acquisition, so devoted to his tastes in food, the state of his appetite, his sleeping place, the collar he was to have, that for the first time in her life she had to be reminded of her books. It needed her great superiority to her companions in any approach to scholarly intellect and attainment to enable her to retain the first place in Miss Burridge's classical department.  \"What shall we call him, Dora?\" she earnestly consulted her sister, hanging breathless on the important answer.  \"Call him whatever you like, May. You know he is your dog,\" said Dora with decision.  \"Mine and Rose's,\" the faithful May made the amendment. \"Of course Rose must agree to any name we think of, or it cannot stand. Perhaps she would like to choose the name as she is away. Don't you think it ought to be put in her power--that she ought to have the compliment?\" suggested May quite seriously and anxiously. \"I shall write to her this very minute.\"  But Rose, like Dora, left the name to May.  \"It was so kind of Tom Robinson to remember and offer him to me,\" said May meditatively. \"O Dora! do you think I might call him 'Tom'?\"  \"Certainly not,\" said Dora, with still greater decision. \"What are you thinking of, May? I don't suppose Mr. Robinson would relish having a dog named for him. Besides, other people might wonder. 'Tom' is not an ordinary name for a dog, though it is common enough for a man.\"  \"Nobody, not even the person most concerned, would know if I were to call him 'Son,' the termination of 'Robinson,' you know,\" explained May, after a moment spent in concocting this subtle amendment, and in fondling the unconscious recipient of a title which was to distinguish him from the mass of dogs.  \"Are you out of your senses, May?\" was the sole comment Dora deigned to deliver with some energy.  \"'Friend,'\" speculated May; \"there is nothing very distinctive about 'Friend,' and I am sure it was the act of a friend to get him for me.\"  \"'Foe' would be shorter and more easily said,\" was Dora's provoking comment; \"or why not 'Fox,' since he is a fox-terrier? You might also desire to commemorate the donor's complexion, which you all used to call foxy,\" said Dora, half reproachfully, half dryly.  \"I don't like _doubles entendres_,\" said May with dignity, \"and if I ever said anything unkind of Tom Robinson I don't wish to be reminded of it now; anyhow, I could never give a sneer in return for a kindness.\"  \"No, I don't believe you could, May,\" said Dora, penitently.  May continued a little nettled in spite of her natural good temper.  \"What are Shakespeare's names for little dogs?\" she asked. \"'Blanche,' 'Tray,' and 'Sweetheart.' You could not be 'Blanche,' could you, pet, unless you were '_Blanche et Noir_'? and that is too long and reminds one of a gaming-table. You could not be 'Sweetheart,'\" went on May, revenging herself with great coolness and deliberation in view of the red that flew into Dora's cheeks; \"no, of course not, because Mr. Tom Robinson is not, never has been, and never will be _my_ sweetheart. There is only 'Tray' left. Well, I think it is rather a good name,\" considered May, critically. \"'Old dog Tray' is an English classic. It is not altogether appropriate, because my Tray is just a baby terrier yet, but we trust, he and I, that he will live to see a venerable age.\"     CHAPTER IX.  A WILFUL DOG WILL HAVE HIS WAY.   Dora and May walked out together regularly, a practice enforced by their father as a provision for their health. To have Tray to form a third person in their somewhat formal promenades certainly robbed them of their formality, and introduced such an element of lively excitement into them as to bear out Dora's comparison of their progresses thenceforth to a succession of fox-hunts. For Tray was still in the later stages of his puppyhood. He was frequently inspired by a demon of mischief or haunted by a variety of vagabond instincts which such training as he had received, without the support of prolonged discipline and practical experience, failed to extinguish.  May was very particular about his education in theory, but in practice she fell considerably short of her excellent intentions. She always carried a whip with a whistle in the handle; and the sight of the instrument of punishment ought to have been enough for Tray, since there was no farther application of it. In reality, the sharp-sighted little animal no more obeyed the veritable whistle than he winced under the supposititious lash of the whip. He took his own way and did very much what he liked in spite of the animated protests of his mistress. Dora and May went out walking with Tray instead of Tray going on a walk with them, and not infrequently the walk degenerated into an agitated scamper at his heels. The scamper was diversified by a number of ineffectual attempts to reclaim him from forcing his way into back-yards and returning triumphantly with a bone or a crust between his teeth, \"as if we starved him, as if his dish at home was not generally half full, though we've tried so hard to find out what he likes,\" said May plaintively. If otherwise engaged it would be in chasing cats, running down fowls, barking at message boys--to whom he had the greatest antipathy--or, most serious foible of all, threatening to engage in single combat with dogs twice his size and three times his age.  There is no accounting for tastes, seeing that these tumultuous walks were the delight of May's days, and that even Dora, with her inveterate sympathy, enjoyed them, though they deranged somewhat her sense of maidenly dignity and decorum. It was to be hoped that as Tray grew in years he would grow in discretion, and would show a little forbearance to the friends who were so forbearing to him.  Tray, Dora, and May had gone on their customary expedition. The human beings of the party were inclined to direct their steps as quickly as possible to one of the country roads. Tray's eccentricities at the present stage of his development were hardly calculated for the comfortable traversing of a succession of streets and lanes. But the canine leader of the party decided for the main street, and Dora and May gave up their own inclinations, and followed in his erratic track with their wonted cheerful submission.  It was a fine October afternoon, when Redcross was looking its best. It was rather a dull town, with little trade and few manufactories, but its worst enemy could not deny it the corresponding virtues of cleanliness and freedom from smoke. Here and there there was a grand old tree wedged between the houses. In one or two instances, where the under part of the house was brick, and the upper--an afterthought--was a projecting storey of wood, the latter was built round the tree, with its branches sheltering the roof in a picturesque, half foreign fashion. Here and there were massive old houses and shops, with some approach to the size and the substantial--even costly--fittings of \"Robinson's.\" A side street led down to a little sluggish canal which joined the Dewes, a river of considerable size on which Redcross had originally been built. This canal was crossed by a short solid stone bridge, bearing a quaint enough bridge-house, still used as a dwelling-place.  The sun was bright and warm without any oppressive heat. The leaves, where leaves were to be seen, had yellow, russet, and red streaks and stains, suggestive of brown nuts and scarlet berries in the hedges.  The flowers in the many window-boxes in which Redcross indulged were still, for the most part, gay with the deeper tints of autumn, the purple of asters and the orange of chrysanthemums setting off the geraniums blossoming on till the frost shrivelled them, and the seeded green and straw-coloured spikes of the still fragrant mignonette.  It was market-day, which gave but a slight agreeable stir to the drowsy town. The ruddy faces and burly figures of farmers, whose imposing bulk somehow did not decrease in keeping with the attenuated profits of long-continued agricultural depression, were prominent on the pavement. Little market carts, which closely shawled and bonneted elderly women, laden with their market baskets, still found themselves disengaged enough to drive, rattled over the cobble stones. An occasional farm labourer in a well-nigh exploded smock frock, who had come in with a bullock or two, or a small flock of sheep, to the slaughter-house, trudging home with a straw between his teeth, and his faithful collie at his heels, made a variety in the town population.  The latter consisted, at this hour, of shop boys and girls, boys from the grammar school, a file of boarders from Miss Burridge's, who walked as if \"eyes right\" and \"eyes left\" were the only motion permitted to them, notwithstanding May's frantic signs to them to behold and admire Tray's gambols; a professional man, or a tradesman, leisurely doing a business errand; one or two ladies carrying the latest fashion in card-cases, suggestive of afternoon calls.  Tray's devious path took him in the direction of \"Robinson's,\" in the windows of which the golden brown of sable furs, the silver gray of rare foxes', and the commoner dim blue of long-haired goats', were beginning to enrich the usual display of silk and woollen goods.  Following his own sweet will, Tray, considerably in advance of his companions, darted into the shop.  \"Oh, what shall we do, May?\" cried Dora in dismay; \"you ought really to put that dog in a leash when he _will_ go into the town.\"  \"Better say a chain at once,\" answered May indignantly, vexed by the imputation on her pet. \"I am sure he has been as good as gold to-day. He has not chased a single thing, and he has only once run away from us. Couldn't I go in and fetch him out? I should not stay above a minute.\"  \"And I am to wait at the door while you hunt him round all the counters and through the showrooms? I had much rather go in with you; but neither do I care to enter the shop when I do not wish to buy anything. Really Tray is too troublesome!\"  \"Oh! don't say that,\" exclaimed May in distress. \"Don't reflect on him in case anything should happen to him,\" as if Dora's speech were likely to bring down the vengeance of Heaven on the heads of all three. \"He soon finds out all he wants when he goes on private expeditions, and then he runs back and looks for us. I think if we walked _very_ slowly his dear bright face, with one ear cocked up, would appear in the doorway by the time we reached it.\"  \"Or some shop-lad may ask him what his business is, and turn him out. It will be a lesson for him in future,\" said Dora, severely.  Accordingly the sisters had to slacken their steps to a snail's pace as they approached the great shop. They had a full view of the interior, though it was a little dark, unless to the most modern taste. There was an air of old-fashioned substantiality, comfort, and something like modest dignity about the long-lasting, glossy brown roof and walls, in harmony with the heavy counters and shelves, not too heavy for the bales of every description, which with the contents of the innumerable boxes had an established reputation of being \"all of the best quality,\" not figuratively but literally. The famous oak staircase, with the broad shallow steps and the twisted balustrade, which would not have disgraced a manor house, ran up right in the centre and terminated in a gallery--like a musician's gallery--hung with Turkey carpets, Moorish rugs, and \"muslin from the Indies,\" and from the gallery various work and show rooms opened. It was evident that \"Robinson's\" was considerably older than the lifetime of the first Robinson--the silk-weaver and wool-stapler who had used it as a mart for his wares. Though it was only the product of a country town, it bore a resemblance to old London city places of business. These were wont to have a Dutch atmosphere of industry and sobriety, together with a fair share of the learning and refinement of the times hanging about them, so that their masters figured as honoured and influential citizens of the metropolis. Belonging to the category were the linen shop of a certain Alexander Pope's father, and the law-stationer's shop, from which issued, in his day, a beautiful youth known as \"Master John Milton.\"  There was the customary bustle of a market day at \"Robinson's.\" Miss Franklin was moving about in the women's department, seeing that everybody there was served, and giving an occasional direction to the women who served. She was, as Dora Millar had once described her, as \"fat as a pin-cushion,\" with what had been originally a fair pink-and-white complexion, degenerated into the mottled \"red all over,\" into which such complexions occasionally pass in middle life. But she looked like a lady by many small traits--by her quiet, easy movements; by the clear enunciation and pleasant tones, which could be ringing when necessary, of a cultivated voice that reached the ears of the bystanders. She did not wear the conventional black silk or cashmere of a shop-woman. There might be a lingering protest or a lurking vanity in the myrtle-green gown and the little lace cap, with its tiny _noeuds_ of dark green riband, which she wore instead. One might guess by their dainty decorum and becomingness that Miss Franklin had thought a good deal, and to purpose, about dress, in her day--had made a study of it, and taken pleasure in its finer effects. In that light she was the right woman in the right place--presiding over the shop-women in a linen-draper's shop. At the same time she belonged as clearly to the upper middle class as did the two girls advancing towards the shop, who, in place of being studiously well and handsomely dressed, were just a little shabby, and careless how they looked in their last year's gray velveteens, with hats to match, which Dora in her conscientious economy had re-trimmed not very nicely.  Lag as the girls might, they could not delay their progress much longer, and their bosoms were torn with conflicting emotions. What were they to do? Leave the truant Tray to his fate? Boldly halt before the next shop window, and trust to his seeing and joining them there? Still more boldly, enter and request \"the body of the culprit\" to be delivered up to his owner? Before they could come to a decision, Tom Robinson himself appeared in the foreground. He was speaking, or rather listening to a giant of a farmer in a light overcoat and streaming cravat, who, in place of treating the master of \"Robinson's\" as \"a whipper-snapper of a counter-jumper,\" was behaving to him with the most unsophisticated deference. Yet Tom's under size and pale complexion looked more insignificant than ever beside the mighty thews and sinews and perennial bloom of his customer. In spite of that, Tom Robinson was as undeniably a gentleman in the surroundings, as Miss Franklin was a lady, and the big honest farmer recognized and accepted the fact. While the pair stood there, and the farmer made an elaborate explanation of the matter in hand--broadcloth or blankets probably--to which Tom attended courteously, as courteously as he would have heard the deliverances of the member of the county or the bishop, Tray flashed out of the mellow obscurity of the background and sniffed vigorously at the trowser ankles of the master of \"Robinson's.\"  \"Hallo!\" cried Tom, looking down at his feet.  \"A bit fine terrier-dawg, Mister Robinson, sir,\" remarked the farmer; \"but I'm thinking he's strayed.\"  At the same instant both Tray and Tom caught sight of May's anxious face peering in at the shop door. Tray rushed to his mistress with a boisterously gracious greeting, which did not include the slightest self-consciousness or sense of wrongdoing in its affability. Tom took a couple of steps after him.  \"I'm afraid, Miss May, you're spoiling that dog,\" he said, in friendly remonstrance, before he observed who was with May, and stopped and bowed with some constraint.  \"Oh! Mr. Robinson,\" replied May, in her volubility effacing any shy attempt at greeting on Dora's part, \"I am so sorry for Tray's rudeness in going into your shop without being invited; but I do think he knew you again, I am almost sure of it,\" she said eagerly, as if the assurance were sufficient propitiation for any trifling lack of ceremony where a reasonable human being was concerned.  \"It might have been better if I had known a little more of him,\" said Tom musingly, biting his moustache, as he took leave of the three.  Tray meandered down the street, followed hurriedly by his mistress and Dora. Tom looked after them, and speculated into how many more scrapes the brute would get the girls, wondered too if one of them would think she had him to thank for the infliction, and that it was an odd instance of the friendship which he had pressed her to give him in lieu of a warmer feeling. That friendship was not progressing very rapidly, though the world might consider the Millars more in need of friends than when he had begged to make one of the number. But Tom Robinson knew better. These girls were enough for themselves in any emergency. They would never fall back on friends or depend upon them. Even Dora, who had stayed at home with May, would suffer in silence and bear anything with and for her family, before she would complain or ask help.  Tray's errant fancy finally took him down a lane leading to the Dewes and to a sheltered walk between rows of yellowing elms by the side of the river. The girls were at last able to enjoy themselves. They sauntered along, talking at their ease, watching the bars of sunlight on the water, and the crowds of flies in the golden mist which the approach of sunset was drawing down over everything, and listening to a robin singing on a bough, when their misadventures for one day culminated and their worst apprehensions were fulfilled. A mongrel collie advancing in the opposite direction, with no better qualified guardian than a young servant girl, who had also a perambulator containing a couple of small children to look after, aroused the warlike spirit of Tray. He growled defiance and bristled in every hair, while Dora caught nervously at his elegant morocco collar, which burst asunder in her grasp, and May shrieked agitated soothing endearments to no purpose. What unmagnanimous cur could resist such a challenge? In another instant the inequal combat was raging furiously. The two dogs first stood on their hind legs, grappled together, and glared at each other for a second, like two pugilists trying a preliminary fall, or a couple of duellists pointing their pistols. The next moment the dogs were rolling over and over each other on the narrow path, worrying each other with the horrible snarling noise that accompanies such a performance.  May danced a frantic dance round the combatants, screamed shrilly, and made dangerous, ineffectual darts at Tray. The servant girl neither danced, nor screamed, nor made darts; she stood stolidly still, with something between a gape and a grin on her broad red face. She had not the passion for dog-fights entertained by the _gamins_ of the streets, such fights were simply immaterial trifles to her amidst the weightier concerns of her life; and she had seen her master's dog get too many kicks in the ribs--a discipline from which he rose up howling but not greatly injured--to be troubled with any sensitive fears as to his safety. Besides his enemy was a small beast, a lady's dog, whom Growler could dispose of in a twinkling, if his temper were up.  \"Oh! can you not call off your dog?\" wailed May in her agony. \"He will kill Tray. Oh! my Tray, my Tray,\" and she made another rush to rescue her pet.  \"Don't, May, you'll be bitten,\" implored Dora.  \"He don't mind me, miss, not one bit, our Growler don't,\" said the composed damsel, as if Growler's indifference were rather a feather in his cap.  Alas! for any attention that the victim paid to May's desperate remonstrances. She had in fact no right to reproach the enemy's temporary proprietress for her lack of authority over her four-footed companion. But poor May in her misery was neither logical nor just. She turned on the other with a passionate challenge, \"What business have you to bring out a horrid brute like that, which you cannot master, to kill other people's dear little pets?\"  \"Hush, hush, May,\" besought Dora, \"I think they are leaving off.\" There was a slight cessation in the hostilities. \"The noise you are making may set them on again.\"  \"It were your dog as begun it.\" Growler's sponsor defended both herself and Growler defiantly.  \"Oh!\" screamed May, \"they're at it again. Tray is down and the cruel monster is at his throat. Will nobody help us? Will nobody save my poor little dog?\"  The girls were carrying neither sunshades nor umbrellas. They could not reach the lower boughs of the trees to pull down a switch, but just as May was springing forward to dare the worst herself, sooner than see Tray perish unaided before her eyes, Dora caught sight of a large half-loose stone in the path. \"Stand back, May,\" she gasped, as she tore it up. Dora's face was as white as paper; she was sick with fright and distress; she would fain have shut her eyes if she had not known that she needed every advantage which sight could give her to prevent her hitting Tray, instead of his foe, as the two rolled over each other in the struggle which was growing deadlier every second.  \"Stop,\" cried a voice of command behind her, \"you'll have the dog turn upon you as soon as he has finished his present job,\" and a welcome deliverer ran forward just in time. He seized the first tail he could grasp--luckily for him it was Tray's and not Growler's--and hung on to it like a vice. The \"redder\" of the combatants, regardless of \"the redder's lick,\" which was likely to be his portion, continued to hold the tail of the now yelling Tray, and at the same time seized him by the scruff of the neck with the other hand, and dragged both animals, still locked together, with his whole force nearer and nearer to the edge of the bank by the river.  A new terror beset May. \"Take care, you'll have them in the water.\"  No sooner said than done. With a plunge the two dogs fell heavily into the Dewes, while the man who had brought them to this pass kept his own footing with difficulty.  \"They'll both be drowned,\" cried May, clasping her hands in the last depths of anguish.  \"Not at all,\" said Tom Robinson, panting a little from his exertions and wiping his hands with his handkerchief. \"I did it on purpose--don't you see? It was the only way to make the beggars lose their grip. Look there, they are swimming like brothers down the stream--that small spitfire of yours is not badly hurt. I told you that you were spoiling him--you ought to make him obey and come to heel, or he will become the torment of your life. The bank shelves a little a few yards further down; you will find that he will come to shore shaking himself nothing the worse. It may be a lesson to him; if not, I should like to give him a bit of my mind.\"  True enough, Tray scrambled up the bank presently, bearing no more alarming traces of the fray than were to be found in his limping on three legs, and halting every other minute that he might ruefully attend to the fourth.  Growler also landed, and after glancing askance at his antagonist and at the champion who had suddenly interposed between Tray and his deserts, wisely agreed with the small maid-servant on the judiciousness of immediately taking themselves off, in company with the perambulator and the babies, to avoid any chance of awkward inquiries.  May ran to Tray, clasped him all dripping in her arms, and prepared to carry him tenderly home. But in spite of the injuries, for which he was exceedingly sorry, he asserted his spirit of independence, and declined to be made a baby of.  \"I am afraid we have given you a great deal of trouble, Mr. Tom,\" said Dora, while May was still devoting herself to her rescued treasure. Dora spoke shyly, and inadvertently used the old familiar name, which he had borne when his father was alive.  \"Don't mention it,\" he said gravely, as shy as she was; \"I feel answerable for inflicting that wretched dog on you--that is, on your sister. I was sure he would lead you a pretty dance after he was in the shop this afternoon.\"  \"Oh! Mr. Robinson,\" cried May, tearing herself away from the contemplation of her darling in order to pour forth her sense of relief and the depth of her gratitude, \"what a good thing it was you came up to us! What should we have done without you? Oh! you don't think dear little Tray is lamed for life--do you? Of course that is ever so much better than having him killed outright in our sight; still if he would only let me pick him up and rest his poor hurt leg it might help him,\" protested May wistfully.  \"Let him alone, he is all right,\" he said in his short stiff way. Then he made a bantering amendment on his speech, because he was quick to see that his want of sympathy vexed the young girl, perhaps rendered her burden of gratitude more difficult to bear.  \"At the worst, you know he would be as well off as Horatius Cocles, and he is likely to escape the beating which he richly deserves.\"  \"Oh! Mr. Robinson, beat him! when he meant no harm, when he has been all but drowned or worried to death by that great, coarse, rough creature,\" cried May, opening large brown eyes of astonishment and indignation.  \"I wonder what _he_ would call Tray if he could speak--an insolent little rascal, who had no proper respect for his superiors.\"  Dora did not join in the conversation. Her colour came and went, and she kept glancing at the handkerchief which Tom Robinson was fluttering about in his hand.  It was May who stopped short and cried in fresh dismay, \"There is blood on your handkerchief; I believe you have been bitten. What shall we do?\"  \"What should you do, Miss May?\" he answered with a laugh. \"It is only a minute impression left by the fine teeth of your friend. You would have it that he knew me a little while ago, and it seems we were destined to be more intimately acquainted.\"  \"Come home with us this minute,\" cried May, so dead in earnest, that she grasped his arm, and made as if she would have dragged him forward. \"Father will dress it and heal it. I am so sorry, so ashamed, though Tray did not know what he was doing.\"  He laughed again quite merrily, as it sounded. \"If Tray did not know, he did his small best to get rid of me. I daresay I was not treating him with much ceremony. I am afraid I gave his tail as sharp a pinch as I could administer before I could get at his neck. No, I am not going home with you; thanks for the invitation. Do you wish Dr. Millar to think me crazy? Do you apply to your father for medical assistance when you give yourself a pin-prick?\"  \"But the bite of a dog is very different, though Tray is the dog,\" moaned May.  \"Tray is in excellent health and spirits; I can vouch for that,\" said Tom. \"I have not the slightest apprehension of hydrophobia.\"  \"O--h!\" said May, with a deeper moan.  Dora had continued silent; indeed she could hardly speak, and her face had grown more like ashes than paper.  He was standing still, and raising his hat a little awkwardly with his left hand, in lieu of shaking hands with his right, as they came to the point where their roads parted.  Dora made a great effort and uttered her remonstrance: \"I wish you would come home with us, and let father look at your hand.\"  \"You too, Miss Dora--nonsense,\" he said sharply as it sounded.  \"If Annie had been here,\" she persisted, \"she would have been of a hundred times more use than I, but if you'll let me I'll try to tie it up for you.\"  She spoke so humbly that he answered her with quick kindness, \"And pain you by exposing a scratch to your notice? No, indeed, all that I'll ask of you is never to fling stones at strange dogs, though they should be tearing that unlucky imp of mischief limb from limb.\"  \"It was very unkind of him to speak so rudely of poor Tray,\" sighed May, as the sisters hurried home; \"although it was Tom Robinson who gave him to me, I don't think the man has ever put a proper value on the dog. But I daresay he will call to-morrow though he has not come with us just now, to ask for Tray, and to see how we are after our fright.\"  \"No, he won't come,\" said Dora with conviction, and she walked on silently thinking to herself, \"How strong and resolute he was, though he is not a big man, and how little he minded being bitten. Men are different from women. Of course, he is nothing to me, but I may be permitted to admire his courage and coolness. No, he will not come, I am sure of that, he is the last man to take advantage of an accident and of his coming to our assistance. Even if he did, and I had ever cared for him, and there had been no 'Robinson's,' it would be too late and too bad to change one's mind after we had grown poor and had to work for ourselves.\"  Dora was right. Tom Robinson did not come. He contented himself with intercepting Dr. Millar on his rounds, learning that Dora and May were no worse for their misadventure, and giving their father a piece of information.  In consequence of that hint, and under the pretence of having Tray's wounded leg properly seen to, he was, to May's intense chagrin and disgust, despatched to a veterinary surgeon's, where he remained for some time, returning at last a sadder and a wiser dog.     CHAPTER X.  LIFE IN AN HOSPITAL WARD.   St. Ebbe's was a model hospital, with every enlightened improvement in the treatment of the sick poor, and every humane ordinance which the highly developed skill and the strongly stimulated benevolence of the nineteenth century could enforce.  Annie Millar was one of six lady probationers, including a bishop's daughter, two daughters of squires, and three doctor's daughters like herself. The matron was the widow of a doctor, who had been eminent alike for professional talent and philanthropy. She was like-minded. If she had not her late husband's knowledge and acumen as a medical man, she had much of his experience, and was full of energy and determination to better the world, the sick, and the poor, almost whether they would or not. Very few people could look Mrs. Hull in the face and contradict her high motives and determined will.  Fortunately, Annie's beauty had not worked the scathing destruction which Mrs. Millar had anticipated with fear and trembling. An inflammable medical student or two might have been just singed by the fire of her charms; an older member of the fraternity might have neglected for an instant to look up at the card above a bed in order to turn his head and cast a second admiring glance after the new recruit in the hospital uniform; but no man forgot his duty or was false to earlier vows through her allurements.  Mrs. Hull had cast a sharp glance at the dainty figure and flower-like face under the nurse's linen gown and close cap. Annie's sister probationers, four of them considerably older than herself, had telegraphed to each other emphatic--perhaps pardonable enough--signals that the last accession to their number was so very ornamental they could hardly expect her to be useful. They must look out for defects, and prepare to atone for failures by their surpassing attainments. But the mistake was soon rectified, and fresh light dawned on the doubtful question. Mrs. Hull was the first to recognize and testify that nothing was to be feared from Annie Millar's youth and beauty, while something might be gained by them, because she was far more than pretty--she was a bright, clever girl, very obedient to orders, and exceedingly anxious to learn her business. In her St. Ebbe's had secured an auxiliary of the highest promise. The elder sister probationers soon found that instead of wanting indulgence, forbearance, and pity, the newcomer was more in danger of awakening their envy as well as their respect by her quickness in mastering details, her mental grasp of principles, her inexhaustible spirit.  Yet poor Annie had no light apprenticeship to serve. The programme, which extends from making poultices and making beds to receiving doctors' instructions, understanding them, remembering them, and acting on them, is neither short nor easy, though a fairly good and trained intellect and an unswerving devotion to duty will get through it triumphantly in time. Annie underwent the entire ordeal, while she doubtless brought a little additional intelligence and capacity and a few more grains of experience to the task than would have existed if she had not been Dr. Millar's daughter. In spite of the warm woollen jacket and cuffs which she wore under her linen gown, her little hands were covered with the chaps and chilblains which are the scourge of maids-of-all-work, because of their early rising, hard scrubbing, and the frequency with which their fingers are wet and dried on chill winter mornings. Her legs ached, as they had never ached after a night's dancing, with being on her feet all day long, and day after day, waiting on her patients and attending on the sisters who were placed over the respective wards. Her mind, too, was kept on the stretch with the serious charge of pulses and temperatures, with the grave responsibility of shelves on shelves of medicine bottles, with acquiring the best modes of bandaging, fomenting, bleeding, stopping the flow of blood, so that during the little leisure she had she could not turn to a book for relief; she fell asleep with sheer fatigue more frequently.  Annie was too high-spirited and independent to feel the loneliness of her position among strangers, whom she soon converted into friendly acquaintances, if nothing more, as many a girl--as Dora, for instance--would have done. But, accustomed as Annie had been all her life to much closer and warmer relations, she clung to the presence of Rose in London; and it was a proof of how much the elder sister was used up, when, even on her days and hours for getting out, it was often with difficulty that she could bring herself to go and see Rose, or to meet and walk a portion of the way with her on Rose's progress from Mrs. Jennings's boarding-house to the Misses Stone's school, where she taught drawing, or to Mr. St. Foy's art classes, where she learned it.  Annie had suffered considerably from what is known as hospital or infirmary sore throat, because it is understood to be caused by inhaling the fumes from the carbolic acid used in the wards. Her rich colour had to Rose's dismay grown poor and pale for a time. She had laboured under the still more trying and more dangerous infliction, when the senses morbidly excited become morbidly acute, and she seemed still to smell the peculiar air of the wards wherever she went. Then Mrs. Hull insisted on Annie's leaving for a few days, and bundled her off, without the power of resistance, to a sister of the matron's, who kindly consented, as her part of the work, to receive and recruit the temporarily overdone servants of St. Ebbe's Hospital.  In spite of the strength of Annie's nerves, and her power of controlling them, she sickened once or twice with a deadly sickness at sights and sounds worse than her most vivid imagination could have conceived possible. She had to summon all her courage, together with the conviction that if she did not overcome the weakness speedily, she would be compelled to own that she had mistaken her calling, in order to vanquish the insidious foe.  Sometimes, while she was ready to thank God that it was rather the exception than the rule, she had to witness the lowest moral degradation in addition to the sharpest human suffering, and this at an age and with a nature when the feeling of extreme repulsion, amounting to positive loathing, is in danger of prevailing. It needed all her faith to do battle with this worst temptation, and force pity to conquer disgust, to recognize humbly the frailty of the best and wisest men and women, to acknowledge willingly, even thankfully, the propriety, if one may so use the word, of what a preacher has called each Christian's suffering, \"the just for the unjust.\"  No wonder poor Annie's bright face took frequently a worn and harassed look in those early days of hospital work.  Yet so great is the elasticity of youth, and so brave and cheerful was the girl's temperament for the most part, that within an hour of such prostrating attacks and violent revolts, she would be on her way with her own little tea-pot to the retiring-room, where the lady probationers and sisters assembled in order to profit by the great boiler steaming on the hob for their women's refreshment of tea. It was about the only servile act which they were required to do for themselves, while they were the servants of others, and they all enjoyed doing it with true housewifely relish. Annie, especially, was an adept at such tea-making, and would propound her theories and circulate specimens of her performance among her companions who profited by her skill, with a glee not far removed from the mirth of the Millar girls on many a happy family gathering in the old nursery or the drawing-room at Redcross.  The whole circumstances of one of the bad days in her lot Annie could never quite forget. It was a raw, gray winter's day, cheerless above and below, and all went wrong on it, from the moment Annie opened her sleepy eyes, leapt shivering out of bed, washed in cold water by her own choice, in order to rouse herself, dressed by gaslight, swallowed her coffee scalding hot, and hastened to her particular ward. The sister and the house-surgeon were, as if affected by the day, a little sour and surly, and every patient seemed more or less out of tune, dismal, grumbling, delirious, or in a state of collapse.  It was one of Annie's out-days, and as a matter of duty, but by no means of enjoyment, she braced herself to change her hospital dress for a walking dress. After she felt chilled to the bone, she started for a walk, either to be jostled and forced along in a crowded thoroughfare, where she too might have said--       \"Although so many surround me,      I know not one I meet\"--  or to creep the length of the cleanest side of the pavement in a depressingly empty street, where the varying arrangement of the shabby window curtains and the cards in the dingy windows, offering an endless supply of rooms to the absent lodging hunter, furnished the sole entertainment to the listless passer-by.  Annie had been afraid that she would miss Rose on her way to her classes, and the fear was amply fulfilled--not the most distant glimpse of Rose was forthcoming. Instead, at a crossing, Ella Carey, in her Aunt Tyrrel's carriage, whirled by the pedestrian and administered a slight spattering of mud to her dress. \"It ought to have been the other way,\" said Annie bitterly to herself, while she stood still to wipe the sleeve of her jacket. Yet she knew very well all the time that Ella's offence had been quite involuntary, and that she had not for a moment recognized Annie. If it had been so, Ella's round girlish face under its smart hat, leaning back among the soft cushions not discontentedly, would have brightened immensely. She would have stopped the carriage and been down in the street at Annie's side in a moment, for the girl was as warm-hearted as she had been docile. There was nothing she would have liked better than to hail a Redcross face, and hear the last news about Phyllis and May, and Ella's father and mother.  When Annie re-entered the hospital colder and more unrefreshed than she had left it, she thought that she was at last going to be compensated for life's rubs--beyond her deserts, she told herself a little remorsefully. She had been longing all the morning for a letter from Redcross, small reason as she had to complain of the negligence of her correspondents there, and a letter with the Redcross post-mark was awaiting her. She saw before she opened it that it was not from any of her family. None of them used such creamily smooth and thick note-paper, or exhibited such a cunningly contrived, elegantly designed monogram. But even a slight communication from the merest acquaintance was welcome as a flower in spring, when the acquaintance dwelt in dear old Redcross. Annie had been thinking fondly of it all day as a place of human well-being and geniality, free from continual sights and sounds of pain and sorrow, where everybody got up and sat down, went out and came in, worked and read, even dawdled and dreamt at will, subject to a few simple household rules. There was no unyielding iron discipline at Redcross. There was no hard and fast routine entering through the flesh and penetrating into the very soul. It was just, dear, deliberate, mannerly, yet comfortable and kindly Redcross. The writer was Thirza Dyer, and the reason why one of the Dyers, who had hesitated about shaking hands with one of the Millars after she was guilty of proposing to earn her livelihood, wrote a letter to a nurse probationer and addressed it to a public hospital, calls for an explanation. The Dyers, in their unceasing efforts to gain by their wealth and its liberal expenditure a footing in the county circle, had got one foot within the coveted precincts, and there Thirza found to her own and her sisters' amazement that nursing, not the rich and great, but common poor people, was a curious fashion of the day. Lady Luxmore had a cousin who was a nurse. General Wentworth's wife had a friend professionally engaged in a London hospital for nine months out of the twelve, who was visiting the Wentworths this winter. Of course it had begun with the Crimean War, and the _clat_ with which lady nurses went out to attend on the wounded soldiers in the exceptional hospital at Scutari. But whatever was its origin, the rule was established that nursing even day-labourers and mechanics with their wives and children, was something very different from being a drudging governess or broken-down companion. It was like being a member of the Kyrle Society, with which one of the princes had to do, or like singing in an East of London concert-room, quite _chic_, perfectly good form, anybody might take it up and gain rather than lose caste by the act.  Accordingly, it became an obvious obligation on the Dyers to cultivate and not to cut the only nurse on their visiting list. With unblushing, well-nigh nave suddenness, Thirza Dyer, to Annie Millar's bewildered astonishment, proceeded to start and maintain a correspondence with her. Two are required for a bargain-making, and Annie was not altogether disinterested in scribbling the few lines occasionally which warranted the continuance of the correspondence on Thirza's part. For if Thirza had lived anywhere else than where she did live, near Redcross, the answer to her first letter might have been different. Therefore Annie did not perhaps deserve much solace from these letters, and certainly this one did not contribute to her exaltation of spirit. It was chiefly occupied with an account of several _recherche_ afternoon teas which the Dyers had held lately at the Manor-house, together with a full description of the tea-gowns of salmon, canary, and cherry-coloured plush, lined with _eau-de-nil_ satin, which the Miss Dyers had worn on these occasions.  Now poor Annie was rather above hankering unduly after tea-gowns, or for that matter \"smart\" or \"swell\" dress of any kind. She liked pretty things, and things which became her charming person, at their proper time and season, well enough, but she was not greatly discomposed by the lack of such adornment, and hardly at all troubled when her neighbours displayed what she did not possess.  It was because the foolishly exultant gorgeous description, which ought to have been set to a fashion-plate, carried Annie back with a flash to one winter's day last year, that it made her heart sore. On the day in question Annie and Dora, and for that matter Rose and May, acting as deeply interested assistants, had been tremendously busy and merry in the old nursery, travestying national and historic costumes in calico. It was all on behalf of a certain scenic entertainment given in the Town-hall for the delectation of the scholars in the Rector's Sunday-school and night classes. It had been a very simple and intentionally inexpensive affair, and the principal charm to the performers had lain in the contriving of their costumes. Annie and Dora had appeared in magnificent chintz sacques--which might have represented tea-gowns--and mob caps, and had been declared by Cyril Carey, who was supposed to be no mean judge, a most satisfactory eighteenth century pair. Cyril himself had broken the rule as to material, and had figured in the black satin trunk hose, velvet doublet, and lace collar of a Spanish grandee. But Ned Hewett had stuck to Turkey-red cotton for a Venetian senator or a Roman cardinal, nobody had been quite certain which. And Tom Robinson had been a Scotch beggarman, Sir Walter Scott's immortal Edie Ochiltree, in a blue cotton gown and a goatskin beard, which she (Annie) had wickedly pretended must have been manufactured out of tufts purloined from the stock of boas at \"Robinson's.\" Lucy Hewett had been shrouded in white cotton wool, to represent the Empress Matilda escaping from Oxford, \"through the lines of King Stephen's soldiers,\" under shelter of a snowstorm. Fanny Russell had never looked better than she looked that night as a Norman peasant girl. It was all very well for Cyril Carey to condescend to the deceit of praising Annie and Dora up to the skies, when everybody knew whom he admired most, with reason. That was Fanny Russell, with her splendid black eyes and hair, and the Norman strength and fineness of her profile.  What was Nurse Annie, in her holland gown, apron, and cap, recalling and revelling in? The silly vanities and child's play of the past. Well, what harm was there in them? These had been blithe moments while they lasted, which had set young hearts bounding, young feet skipping, and young voices laughing and singing in a manner which was natural, and not to be forbidden lest worse came of it.  Annie was roused from her pleasant reverie and plunged into another of a totally different description. The last was made up of garbled reality, but with what truth was in it tending to a false, doleful vision. It would represent St. Ebbe's as a gloomy, ghastly prison-house of suffering and death, and she in her tender youth and sweet beauty immured in it by an error of judgment, a fatal mistake incidental to rash enthusiasm and total inexperience. If Annie ever arrived at that rueful conclusion, how could she bear the penalty she must pay?  Annie had heard and read of young women on whom the world did not cry shame, who turned from the decay and death they had not gone to seek, which Providence had brought to their doors, in paroxysms of repugnance and rebellion. They could not bear that their perfection of health and life should come into contact with something so chillingly, gruesomely different, that their glowing youth should be wasted in the dim shadows of sick-rooms or amidst the dank vapours hovering over the dark river which all must ford when their time comes. Those standing round who heard or read the outcry called it natural, piteous, well-nigh praiseworthy, it was so sincere. How could Annie realize for herself in a moment that such heroines(!) are the daughters in spirit of the women who, in outbreaks of medival pestilence and latter-day cholera, have literally abandoned their nearest and dearest, fleeing from spectacles of anguish and risks of infection? How could she guess that such women are the spiritual sisters of poor heathen and savage Hottentot and Malay mothers and daughters, who, sooner than be burdened with the wailing helplessness of infancy and the mumbling fatuity of age, will expose the children dependent on these murderesses, and the hoary heads that once planned and prayed for the welfare of their slayers, to perish of cold and hunger?  It was Annie's hour for resuming work, and it was well for her, though she went but languidly into the spotlessly white and clean ward, among its rows of beds with the flower-stand, illuminated texts and oleographs, which generous supporters of the hospital sent to brighten its cold bareness and soften and cheer what was harsh and subdued in its atmosphere. Annie was not even greatly affected by the greeting of one of her patients, an elderly man recovering from an operation, and still slightly off his head when the fever rose on him. She went to him with a cooling, soothing application, and he told her incoherently to come again and give him his dinner and his tea. He liked a young lass or lady, be she which she liked, with red cheeks and shining eyes to wait upon him. It minded him of a bit wench of a daughter of his he had lost when she was twelve years--the age of the little wench in the Bible, for parson had preached about her the Sunday after his lass's funeral. It broke her mother's heart for all that, and he buried her too within three months. Then the place got lonesome, and he took what was not good for him, till he had come to this; though whether it were the House or just an hospital he was lying in he could not clearly say.  Then there happened what Annie was wont to describe as a miracle of mercy to bring her to a better mind. A young boy whose leg had been crushed by a waggon was carried into the operating theatre for an immediate operation. It was the lecture hour, and a great professor of surgery with his class of students, together with several of the other doctors connected with St. Ebbe's, was in attendance. But it was also customary, especially where a female patient or a patient so young as the boy in question was concerned, for a nurse, generally the sister of the ward, to be present to hold the sufferer's hand if it were wished, or when it was possible to support the poor head against her breast. It so chanced that the sister was out, and other available nurses were engaged, so in circumstances which would admit of no delay Annie was for the first time called to the front and summoned to undertake the responsibility of the situation. Already she had lost sight of herself, and was standing looking so calm, firm, and prepared for every emergency, that the operating surgeon, with a glance at her, put her youth and position as a probationer aside, and accepted what help she could give.  It was a critical case, and for some medical reason no ansthetic could be administered. The boy was past the unconsciousness of childhood, and though nearly fainting with fright, pain, and weakness, remained quite sensible of the further ordeal he had to undergo. He was keenly alive to the humane motive which induced the surgeon to turn his back upon him in selecting his instruments. He even heard, with ears morbidly acute, the low words addressed to the interested spectators, \"Now, gentlemen, I am about to begin.\"  With a stifled sob the poor little fellow suddenly managed to raise himself from the table on which he was stretched. He looked round wildly on the circle of men's faces, controlled and expectant, with a certain every-day expression in anticipation of what, in its blind terror and life and death importance to him, was a familiar occurrence to them, and on the one woman's face, controlled too, but with an indescribable wistfulness under the control. Then he made his childish appeal, shrill with misery, \"Oh, gentlemen, will you not stop till I say my prayers?\"  There was an instant pause of surprise, commiseration, constraint--the peculiar awkwardness which in Englishmen waits on any provocation to betray feeling. Nobody liked to look at his neighbour to see how he looked, lest there should be the most distant sign of emotion in his own face. Some strong men there had ceased to pray or to believe in prayer, yet all were more or less touched by the lad's implicit faith.  As for Annie she had been praying at that very moment, praying fervently in the silence of her heart, that she might be saved from breaking down and allowed to be of some service to the boy.  \"Certainly, certainly, my little chap; but you must be quick about it,\" said the great surgeon a little hoarsely.  \"Our-Father-which-art-in-Heaven,\" began the boy, running the words together and speaking with a parrot-like monotony in an unnaturally high-pitched key. Then his voice began to quaver a little till he stopped short with a cry of despair--\"I cannot mind the words, I cannot say my prayers. Oh! will nobody say them for me? If mother, as is not in Lon'on, were here, she would do it fast,\" he ended, flinging out one thin arm and clutching convulsively at the air in a kind of panic-stricken terror.  There was another second's dead silence. It was broken by a woman's voice. Annie had taken a step forward close to the boy's elbow, so that her voice was in his ear. She could not kneel, but instinctively she clasped her hands and bent her head reverently as she said in low but clear tones which were carried throughout the length and breadth of the room, and thrilled in every ear, the Lord's Prayer. At its close she went on without hesitation in the same wonderfully audible voice: \"God bless this little boy. Forgive him every wrong he has ever done. Keep him safe, and raise him up again, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.\"  Another voice--a deeper one--responded to the \"Amen.\" It was said by the famous operator's enemies that he was lax in his religious opinions, and that he rarely found time to go to church. Nevertheless it was he who with grave heartiness repeated the Amen.  The little lad had sunk back when she began to speak, and there he lay without giving her a word or sign of thanks--his best acknowledgment of her compliance with what might be his last wish being his quaking submission. He could not keep still his quivering flesh, or hold back altogether his piercing cries and piteous moans, but he bit his tongue in seeking to stifle them. For he was not fighting with his Maker and his fate; he was trying in his boyish way, with his small fortitude and resignation, to endure, in the might of the support which had been asked for him.  Annie too clenched her teeth, while she opened her eyes to take in everything that passed before them, as a mirror may be turned to receive the minutest impression from the scene it reflects. But she did not hear a single shriek or wail, because her ears were filled with the higher harmonies which she had called forth. She clasped one of the boy's trembling hands in her own warm one, which did not grow cold in the contact. She was on the alert to meet his only half-seeing gaze, and to give back a glance of tender sympathy and protection--the true mother's look that is to be found when occasion calls for it in every good woman's face,--ay, it may even be seen in the precociously earnest, kindly eyes of many a loving woman-child.  There were plenty of other helpers to render the surgeon all the assistance he needed in his work, with far more celerity and ability than Annie could have supplied. But while sense lingered in the little patient's eyes, it was to the woman he turned for the pity and aid which did not fail him; it was through her that he drew from One mightier than all, the spiritual strength for his terrible bodily conflict. In a sense Annie and he were both on their trial, they served their novitiate together, and helped each other to bear and overcome. When the operation was over he lay, with the sweat drops of agony which Annie was gently wiping off, not gone from his forehead, but also with the reflection still lingering on his white face of the courage and patience with which he had been ready to meet death.  \"You have behaved remarkably well, and shown no want of pluck, my lad,\" said the surgeon as a parting word of encouragement and cheer. \"Lie still and you'll be able to see your friends by and by. I believe you'll do famously, and we'll see whether a substitute cannot be found for the limb you have lost.\"  He turned to Annie who had done all, and more than all, that was required of her, probably because she had entirely forgotten herself. She was not even then sensible of a swift reaction, an overwhelming tide of embarrassment. She continued more than half unconscious of the number of eyes which, now that the operation was over, were fixed upon her, marvelling, admiring, condemning, or ridiculing. For what act is there, let it be ever so disinterested or self-sacrificing, against which no voice will rise in condemnation or in mockery?  But it was not the operating surgeon who either condemned or scoffed at Annie's conduct. He drew her aside, not speaking to her on the religious side of the episode, which he did not conceive that he had the smallest right or title to do, but addressing her on the purely medical aspect of the incident, on which he considered that he was entitled, nay, even bound to speak. His manner was a little blunt and brusque rather than suave, like that of a man who had no time to waste in paying compliments or making soft speeches, but it was thoroughly approving.  \"You did quite right, nurse; I'm much obliged to you. That poor boy wanted all the comfort he could get. If he had gone on and worked himself into a frenzy before I had taken up the knife, I do not know that I could have done my work, and certainly the probability of his recovery would have been greatly lessened.\"  \"I am glad,\" said Annie simply, with a little gasp of returning consciousness. \"It is good of you to say so, doctor,\" but it was doubtful whether she knew what she was saying. She was penetrated through and through with thankfulness, yet thanks to herself seemed so irrelevant that she did not care to hear them.  There was more than Annie who thought that thanks to her were out of place and superfluous. This was specially so with one among the group of younger men, who at the moment of entering the ward had been fully alive to the circumstance that \"the pretty nurse,\" as she was known to them, was on active duty. They had speculated on whether she would stand an operation, and what a disturbance and nice mess there would be if she fell flat on the small of her back on the floor, or went off in a fit of hysterics in the middle of it; and how their \"boss\" would endure such a disconcerting interruption to the proceedings. As it happened, the speculators were in their turn startled, abashed, or irritated, according to their respective temperaments and frames of mind, by what followed.  But there was a young giant, with a blonde beard, who let his blue eyes fall on the floor, drew back till he leant against the wall, and thrusting his hands into his pockets, asked himself in a dazed, humbled way, if an angel had come down among them, and where was the good of presuming to thank an angel? It was a thousand times more officious and audacious than to disregard the hackneyed quotation about the folly of painting a lily and perfuming a rose.  Annie, the moment she could be spared, went to her own room, fell down on her knees, and cried as if her heart would break. Yet they were not unhappy, but blissful tears, though they were as much for her own unworthiness as for God's unmerited goodness.  Then she snatched up a sheet of paper and wrote home. \"I was so discontented--such a peevish wretch, this morning, but I have had a tonic, and now I am so unspeakably satisfied with my lot in life that I believe I am the happiest girl in England to-night. I would not change places with a hundred old Aunt Pennys, only I know, alas! that I am not half good enough to be a nurse. Yet I would rather be a nurse than any other character in the world, and I would not go back for a permanency to dear old Redcross, after which I was hankering this very morning, and live at home with you all again, leading the aimless, self-seeking life I led, not though Mr. Carey's bank were to rise out of its ashes and flourish to an extent that its greatest upholders never dreamt of--not though I were to get a pension or an earl's ransom, or whatever else people count magnificent compensations and rewards. But you must not think that it is because I do not love you all as well and a thousand times better than I ever loved you, for that would be a great mistake, since I am just beginning to know your true value. But don't you understand it would break my heart to think that I should no longer be a nurse and never have such another experience as I have had this afternoon.\" And then she told them in a very few words what had happened and what the surgeon had said to her. How the sister of the ward, and the matron, and everybody she knew in St. Ebbe's had congratulated her. They had all united in promising that the poor little fellow should be her patient in future; they had begun already to call him \"Miss Millar's boy.\"  The little Doctor not only wiped his spectacles, he held his head higher. Mrs. Millar read the letter again and again, appropriating it and carrying it in her pocket till it was worn to fragments. These were still religiously preserved and portions read to select and sympathetic audiences. And every time she read the lines herself with a full heart, she called on God to bless her good Annie, and thought she was honoured among mothers in having such a daughter.  As for Dora and May they were long of ceasing to talk with bated breath and the height of loving enthusiasm of how Annie had mastered herself, and what a stay she had been in the hour of need to the lad. They planned and carried out their plans at every spare moment, in the manufacture of knitted socks and cravats for his benefit. But their great achievement was a quilted dressing-gown which Dora contrived to cut out, and May, in spite of her bad sewing, to help to sew together, that in his convalescence he might sit up in bed like a little sick prince.     CHAPTER XI.  MRS. JENNINGS AND HER DAUGHTER HESTER.   Rose Millar had made up her mind to like everything, if possible, in her new surroundings, and when she came up to town it was not only by a piece of good fortune, it was to the girl's credit, that she found so much she could appreciate, and so little, comparatively, that it was difficult to put up with.  In the first place, and as of primary consequence to Rose's well-being, Mrs. Jennings, the lady with whom Rose was boarded, turned out an excellently-disposed gentlewoman. She had a well-ordered house, pervaded with the spirit of a gentlewoman. The whole establishment was full of the self-respect which showed itself in a scrupulous consideration for the rights and claims, the doings and feelings, of others.  Rose did not complain because Mrs. Jennings and her house alike were also antiquated and formal. But the lady was not merely formal; it was a point of honour and an inveterate weakness with her to refuse to own that she had anything to do with such small but welcome boons to her as boarders. There she sat, serenely disclaiming the slightest knowledge of what had taken place, and attributing every attention to her old servant Susan, who had been with Mrs. Jennings since her marriage five-and-thirty years before. Or, if it was not Susan, it was her coadjutor, Marianne, in her housemaid's neat dress, whom Susan, in her working housekeeper's black cap and gold-rimmed spectacles, had trained to all fit and proper service in a gentlewoman's house.  In person Mrs. Jennings was tall and thin, sallow, and slightly hook-nosed, but still handsome. Her upright, broad-shouldered, and, by comparison, slender waisted figure was conventionally good; but it was hard to say how far it was her own, or how much it was made up. For she was one of those women who consider that it is a duty which they owe to the world not only to show themselves to the best advantage in bodily presence to the last, but so to conceal and atone for the ravages of time as to preserve a semblance of their maturity after it is long past. The performance is not altogether successful. For one thing, it is apt to call forth a spirit of contemptuous pity in the youthful spectator who is still a long way from needing to employ such laborious, self-denying arts.  Mrs. Jennings added to her natural air of dignity by a filmy shawl of black lace in summer, and of white Shetland wool in winter, draped round her without so much as a fold out of order, and by a somewhat elaborate modification of a widow's cap which added half an inch to her height. As Rose wrote in an early letter home, Mrs. Jennings's cap looked as if she had been born with it on her coal black hair, or as if it were glued and gummed there beyond any possibility of being displaced. Mother ought to see it, take an example, and abandon her flighty, waggling head-gear. No, on second thoughts, Rose would not like to see mother with a cap fitted on her head like the bowl of a helmet, and giving the idea of such stony stability that it might have been fastened with invisible nails hammered into her skull.  Hester Jennings, Mrs. Jennings's daughter, was the young art student like Rose's self, to whom she and her friends had naturally looked for congenial companionship where the girl was concerned; and if she did not find it with Hester, she was not likely to discover it in any of the other residents at No. 12 Welby Square. Naturally Rose did not greatly affect the remaining members of that elderly society, on which Mrs. Jennings professed to set store. She could not help liking Mrs. Jennings, though, alas! Rose scarcely believed in her so much as she would have been justified in doing.  In Mrs. Jennings's daughter, who had been from the first thought of as a friend for Rose, she believed entirely. Yet Rose had been in the beginning both startled by Hester Jennings and disappointed in her.  Hester Jennings looked considerably older than she was, which was about Annie Millar's age; in fact, she was prematurely worn with study and work. She was like her mother on a larger scale, with advantages of a fair paleness and remarkable violet-blue eyes, which Mrs. Jennings had never possessed. Hester might have passed for a lovely young woman if she had cared in the least to do it. But never was girl more indifferent to such claims or more capable of doing her worst to qualify them and render them the next thing to null and void. When Annie Millar made Hester Jennings's acquaintance, Annie maintained that there was something left out in Hester's composition, the part which makes a woman desire to look well in the eyes of her neighbours, and win admiration, though the admiration be as skin deep as the beauty which creates it.  To think that a daughter of Mrs. Jennings, an artist in her own right, could dress so badly, with such a careless contempt for patterns and colours, in such ill-fitting frocks and dowdy or grotesque hats! Her preference for strident aniline dyes and gigantic stripes and checks in the different articles of her costume looked very like perversity; especially when it was shown that with reference to other persons, in arranging to paint a portrait, for instance, no one, not Mrs. Jennings, displayed such a fine sense of fitness and harmony as Hester exhibited. Dress was to her, in her private character, mere necessary clothing, warm or cool as the season required. It was not worth the waste of thought implied by turning it over in her mind. Her mother dressed for the family; or, if she did not, Hester understood that her married sisters and sisters-in-law devoted, with success, a great deal of time which they did not value in other respects, to the subject in question.  Speak of Rose Millar's professional notions as to the human figure being left easy and untrammelled! Rose was a pattern of decorous neatness and trimness compared to Hester; indeed, Rose was appalled by the total absence of order and ceremony, not to say of embellishment, in her friend's toilet. Hester abandoned herself permanently to deshabilles. She appeared in a jacket indoors as well as out. She dispensed with collars in morning and lace in evening wear. She did her hair once when she got up, and regarded passing her hand over her head when she took off her hat as all that was incumbent upon her afterwards. Without intending it, and without dreaming of copying the bushes of hair in Rossetti's pictures, Hester Jennings's sandy-coloured locks, not a good point in her personal appearance, were, as her great-grandmother would have cried in horror, more like a dish-mop than anything else. She stopped short of dirt in her slovenliness because of her purity of soul, her deep respect for the laws of health, and because of the traditions of her class, from which she could not altogether escape. But between her bondage to work, and her scornful neglect of other claims which she had known over-exalted and exaggerated, she had accomplished marvels.  Hester Jennings had attained such eminence in her recklessness of consequences, that, in place of being a nearly lovely woman, in accordance with her profile, complexion, and glorious eyes, she was barely good-looking because of them, in a style which repulsed many more people than it attracted others. The sight of Hester was one of the numerous lessons which she was destined to give to Rose Millar. It frightened Rose into becoming tamely conventional and elaborately tidy in dress, to the surprise and edification of her sister Annie, for it was just at the time when Annie was most spent by her new life and labours, and least inclined to put off her hospital gown and cap.     CHAPTER XII.  A YOUNG ARTIST'S EXPERIENCE.   Rose respected Hester Jennings. She could not help respecting her--a creature so much in earnest, so indefatigably industrious, so indifferent to all the distractions of the outer world which might have taken her out of herself and away from her work, while she was not above three or four years Rose's senior. If Hester would have let her, the respect would have deepened to reverence, when Rose discovered what the elder girl neither hid nor boasted of, that she was not only paying for her art lessons at the art school, and in other respects freeing her mother from the burden of her maintenance,--she was steadily earning a small independent income by working incessantly at every spare moment snatched from her studies. She worked at all sorts of designs for the most insignificant and obscure cheaply illustrated books and periodicals which cannot exist entirely on old plates excavated from forgotten stores, bought by the thousand at trade sales, procured by transfer from America, or even--now that national costumes are dying out--from France and Germany. These attempts at art were intended to pass into the hands of children--not the favoured children reared on the charming fancies of Caldecott and Kate Greenaway; but homelier, more stolid, and easily satisfied children. Such art was also for the masses of the people who cannot pay for original art, save in its first uncertain developments, when the stagier it is, the blacker, the bolder, the more meretriciously pretty or fantastically horrible, the better it is relished by its public. Even the stereotyped representations of the coarser fashion-plates, and the eccentric symbols and arbitrary groups employed in the humbler trade advertisements which the magnates in such advertising have left far behind, were food for Hester's unresting pencil. She might have injured herself irreparably by such illegitimate practice had she not studied as faithfully as she designed, with something of a stern, merciless severity, hunting out and correcting in her studies the errors of her crude work.  Stress of circumstances had lent what the French would have called a brutal side to Hester's natural candour and sincerity. It was one comfort that she was still more brutal to herself than to the rest of the world.  When Rose Millar showed her sister-artist some of Rose's sketches, Hester gave them a glance and a toss aside one after the other.  \"There is nothing in that,\" she said coolly, \"though I can see you have taken some trouble with it. This is not so bad. No, don't show that thing to anybody else--it will do you harm.\" Her highest praise was the \"not bad\" of mildest negative approval. \"When you go to the class to-morrow morning,\" predicted the slashing critic, \"you may depend upon it you will be turned back to a course of free-hand, or to copying from the round again. I don't mean that Mr. St. Foy will be as plain-spoken as I have been; he is a great deal too much afraid of hurting your feelings and his own, and of losing a pupil, though he is not what I should call either a bad man or a bad teacher. He is just like the rest; but wait and see if he does not politely turn you back to very nearly the beginning.\"  \"I have had good teachers before,\" said Rose, crumpling up her nose and her forehead tightly, and swelling a little with wounded self-respect as well as wounded vanity. \"It is queer, to say the least, if all my teachers were in a conspiracy to push me on to what I was not fit for, and to give me work altogether beyond my powers.\"  \"You asked my opinion,\" said Hester Jennings, with inflexible calmness, \"and I am not surprised that you do not like it when you have got it--few people do. The truth is not generally palatable. Not that I go in for infallibility of judgment. Wait and see what Mr. St. Foy does--not says--to-morrow.\"  \"But why were the others--one of them an exhibitor at the Academy and the Grosvenor--so much mistaken?\" inquired Rose, with natural indignation.  \"How can I tell? But I hope you do not imagine that exhibitors are necessarily geniuses, or not as other men, or that they must be able to do a little bit of tolerable teaching when it pays them to condescend to it? Mr. St. Foy never exhibits--very likely for the good reason that his pictures are not accepted; but it does not follow on that account that he cannot paint a fairly good picture--better even than some which are hung on the line--and teach very tolerably to boot.\"  This was a new, bewildering doctrine, and a thoroughly disheartening state of matters, to which Rose, extinguished as she was on her own merits, did not make any reply.  \"What I think, if you care to hear further what I think,\" said Hester, with a dry smile, \"is that in not taking time and in being wild to paint a complete picture--something which everybody could recognize as a picture, and your friends admire--as if such a thing can be done to any good purpose for years and years--you have fallen into the disastrous habit of forgetting, or of only half remembering, what you learnt before, as you went on learning more. At least, that is the only way in which I can account for the wretchedness of some of your drawing, and the badness of your perspective, when you have got so far as to have a feeling for a scale of colour and the tone of a picture.\"  \"Well, I suppose I can learn it all over again,\" said Rose, with a mixture of spirit and doggedness, forcing herself not to betray further resentment, and to swallow a little girlish weakness at the uncompromising treatment she was receiving. What would May and Dora say? But she durst not trust herself to think of them.  \"Of course,\" answered Hester, opening widely a pair of singularly clear keen eyes. \"Do you think I should have taken the trouble to say as much if I had thought otherwise?\"  It was the one dubious compliment which Rose extracted, without meaning it, from the fault-finder.  Hester's openly expressed desire was to be an artist out and out, to live like an artist, not to be troubled with the hindrances and petty restrictions of an ordinary woman's life, which she was tempted to despise, to which, if she yielded at all in her mother's house, it was with scarcely concealed reluctance and aversion. Very likely she had only the most one-sided conception of the life she would have chosen. Certainly her notions of Bohemianism were about as ingenuous as \"little May's\" might have been; to go where art called her, to do what art demanded of her, to be art's humble, diligent, faithful servant all her days, without being held back and fettered on every hand by set meals, obtrusive servants, changes of dress, the obligation to pay and receive visits. The dream of her life was to get to Paris and have lessons in one of the French studios, where she was led to believe women have as good a chance of being well taught as men possess. She would prefer to live with some young women students like herself _en fille_--a modified--much modified version of _en garon_. They would hire an _tage_ in some cheap, convenient quarter, get the wife or daughter of the _conciergerie_ to prepare breakfast and supper for them, dine at one of Duval's restaurants work all day, and sleep the sleep of the labouring woman at night. She said she knew quite well how such artists were considered in Paris, that they were regarded as _vauriennes_, to whom there was no occasion to pay the respect and consideration which were reserved for the potent _mesdames_ and the _jeunes filles ingnues_ of society. But what had she to do with society? She belonged to the great republic of art, and had infinitely more to occupy her than to listen for what society would say. As to not being able to take care of herself and behave so that the slightest indignity to her would never be ventured upon, the bare mention of such a possibility was received by Hester with a wrath which bordered on fierceness, and for the most part silenced her opponents effectually. Any displeasure which Annie Millar had displayed on a similar supposition was mild by comparison.  Hester was not an only child. Mrs. Jennings had sons, all in the army or navy, the mother was proud to say; but none of them in those days of competitive examinations and expensive living was high enough up in the service to be able to help his mother. On the contrary, grown men, with men's callings, as they were, they found themselves under the necessity of taking help from her. There were also other daughters besides Hester married to men in professions as unexceptionable as those of their brothers-in-law, but neither were they in circumstances which could make them feel justified in granting the smallest subsidy to Mrs. Jennings. Only Hester toiled for her mother at every moment which she could take from her studies and her natural rest. Yet the two women, who had dwelt under the same roof since Hester's babyhood, who were united by the strongest and most sacred tie, were without one taste in common, were irreconcilably different in every mode of thought and impulse of feeling, were only alike in each being well-intentioned and desirous of fulfilling her intuitions and justifying her beliefs. Being wise, the pair agreed to differ. But oh! the pity of it where aims, ideals and standards, hopes and fears, were all equally wide apart.  Mrs. Jennings did not interfere with Hester's freedom farther than she could help. Hester had her own engagements, her own circle of friends.  It may not surprise those who are acquainted with the various versions of Hester Jennings to be met with in this generation, that she was a red-hot radical in contrast to her mother's conservatism--well-nigh a _communiste_, to whom woman's rights and wrongs meant a burning question of the day, which, next to her love of art, came very near to her heart. She was almost powerless to assist her sister women, so overworked was she on her own account, but whenever she could snatch a moment half a dozen clubs and societies claimed her for their own. She had really a wide personal knowledge of the working-women of London, employed and unemployed.     CHAPTER XIII.  MR. ST. FOY'S AND THE MISSES STONE'S.   There was a second and large portion of Rose's life which belonged to her art classes, and to the classes in which she was one of the teachers and not one of the taught. In the art classes Hester Jennings's influence still dominated over Rose. In spite of Mr. St. Foy's professional qualifications, for which Hester had vouched, he had not so potent a personality as that possessed by one of his favourite pupils. He was tall, thin, gentleman-like, and delicate-looking, with a habit of languidly winking his eyes every second or two, as if they were weary of the trying sights of this world. He was kind to Rose in his courteous way, but she would not have been certain either of his ability to judge her work or of his honest opinion of it, if it had not been for what Hester told her.  There were fifty pupils among whom she and Hester ranked. These occupied the desks, worked at the easels, copied from copies, from the round or--height of promotion--from well-known models attached to the institution. There was the old market woman who obligingly sat alike for wicked old hags and doting grandmothers. There was the athletic young porter, off duty, who was a brigand or a pilot as occasion served.  The pupils were of various styles, idle and chattering, picturesque and sentimental, industrious, commonplace, but the most of them were variations on that last accepted version of the lady artist--the individual girl who aims at being independent and natural to the verge of harmless lawlessness and Philistinism--strange reaction from stheticism. There were many Hester Jennings's though none so pronounced as Hester.  The Misses Stone's select boarding-school carried Rose twice a week into another region, where the wind did not blow so freely and the air was a trifle stifling. Sometimes she wondered if the Misses Stone knew the tone of a large proportion of the young lady artists at Mr. St. Foy's classes--not that Rose herself could see anything absolutely wrong in it--whether they would care to have an assistant drawing-mistress from those half-emancipated, more than half insubordinate ranks. However, Rose's appointment was not in any great danger of being cancelled. She had involuntarily become doubly careful in her dress and demeanour lately, and she discovered that the Misses Stone were old and intimate friends of Mrs. Jennings, whom they pitied sincerely for having so troublesome a daughter.  At first Rose did not dislike the office of teacher, which brought her in a little income before she was out of her teens. The whole place reminded her pleasantly of Miss Burridge's school which she had quitted but recently, only instead of having a metropolitan superiority in enlightenment and progress, strange to say, the Misses Stone's establishment, as if drawing within itself and shrinking back from the constantly moving, restlessly advancing world around, was really older-fashioned, less in the van of public opinion than the school at Redcross. The Misses Stone, their teachers and pupils, were well-bred, and what might have been called in past days \"prettily behaved,\" though the behaviour was a little formal. Women and girls were elegantly accomplished, in place of being solidly informed or scientifically crammed, in accordance with the fashion of the nineteenth century. Above all, they declined with a gentle unconquerable doggedness to be turned from the even tenor of their ways. Italian was still largely taught in the school, while only a fraction of the pupils learnt German. Latin had no standing ground save in the derivation of words, Greek was unknown. The word mathematics was not mentioned. The voice of the drill-sergeant was not heard, but the dancing-master with his kit attended twice a week, like Rose, all the year round. The harp was played by the pupils instead of the violin. Withal there was much careful learning and repeating of Sunday Collects and the Church Catechism.  The school found ample support. What it attempted to do was in the main well done. Undoubtedly there was an attraction, half-graceful, half-quaint, in all connected with it, from the gentle manners of the elderly Misses Stone, who were only bitter against what was bold, impertinent, and eccentric, to the most dainty of their small pupils. Strictly conservative people felt that their daughters were safe in such an atmosphere, and patronized it accordingly. Undoubtedly they learnt a good deal which was worth learning.  Rose began by receiving nothing save the most considerate kindness and approval in that house. It was a libel on its forms and ceremonies to imagine that they contained anything tyrannical and harsh in their essence. The very law of their being was amiability, combined with mild steadfastness in withstanding the subversive attitude of the time. The most highly-born, richly-endowed girl within the precincts--and the school was rather aristocratic--would no more have ventured on being rude to Miss Rose Millar, the junior drawing-mistress, than the girl would have presumed to stamp her foot at one of the Misses Stone. If Rose had dropped her pencil in the course of her work, the highly-born pupil, by force of example, if for no other reason, would immediately have risen and picked it up, though she might not have made the speech about a Titian being worthy to be served by a Csar. In fact Rose was in danger of being killed with kindness. Soon she was conscious of something choking, crushing, dwarfing in this artificial system. This was made more conspicuous to her by the choice of art subjects for the girls' study. There was no end of flower and fruit pieces. There were the stereotyped noble ruins, and cottages, either embowered in roses or half-buried in snow. There were the Dutch and Venetian boats which had never sailed on familiar waters. Stags abounded, and Rose ceased to ask why so many of them stood at bay. The sleeping baby, which might have been a dead baby or a stone baby, was there; so was the long-nosed, wooden-legged collie, watching the shepherd's plaid. With what a lively hatred Rose grew to hate that collie!  Rose felt herself \"cribbed, cabined, and confined\" when she came from the comparative open air and robust life of Mr. St. Foy's classes. Yet even these were not the world of art. She got nervous in the fear of unworthily committing solecisms against the silken softness and steely rigidity of the Misses Stone's shrine. She thought if she caught up and reproduced any of Hester's vagabond notes--the Misses Stone were necessarily slightly acquainted with Hester, of whom, however, they never spoke--it would be like throwing a bombshell among these quiet, unalterable proprieties. She came to have a morbid, feverish craving to do it, or to see some other person do it. For instance, if young Lady Maud Devereux would but bid Rose tie her shoe, or even if she would contradict Miss Stone, or Miss Lucilla, or Miss Charlotte, without prefacing the contradiction by \"I beg your pardon!\"  At last these two days a week of giving lessons at the Misses Stone's, from being merely the agreeable lucrative variety in her life which they had promised to be, became gray days of penance to Rose Millar, when she felt she was under a spell, and did her duty badly. She ceased to refer to them in her letters home.  Rose arrived one morning at the Misses Stone's in a peculiarly excitable and yet depressed frame of mind. She had not been to Mr. St. Foy's classes that day; but Hester Jennings had known, the afternoon before, a piece of unwelcome news which she thought fit to communicate to Rose in the course of their morning walk, that ran so far in the same direction. A group of peasants, with which Rose Millar had been taking a great deal of pains, had been summarily condemned and dismissed by the master. Rose waxed hot and restive under the sentence, and began to dispute it vehemently, Hester defending it with equal vehemence, in what she considered justice to Mr. St. Foy, on the ground of a lack of dignity and repose in the central peasant. Hester was at that moment tearing along a thoroughfare, and showing so little dignity and repose not only in her gait, but in her \"loud,\" ill-assorted garments, that, as frequently happened, to Rose's vexation, several people among the passers-by turned and looked after them. Hester to talk of a want of dignity and repose! It was like Satan reproving sin.  At the same time, while it is hard to admit the justness of a criticism unaffected by the inconsistency of the person who utters it and of the circumstances under which it is uttered, Rose was perfectly well aware that Hester Jennings was as excellent a judge of dignity and repose, apart from her personal proceedings, as any artist could be.  Rose did not retaliate, save in self-defence. Hester was her senior in art-knowledge still more than in years. She was not her sister to be treated without ceremony, and pretty deep down in Rose's girlish heart there was a respectful tolerance, an approach to tender reverence, for the turbulent-minded, chaotic, gifted creature beside her. Still Rose's equanimity was considerably disturbed.  The unruffled serenity of the Misses Stone's domain, far from restoring Rose's composure, seemed to smite her by contrast with an intolerable sense of personal reproach, and to goad her into rebellion. Rose was conscious of her variable spirits--the heritage of her years--getting more and more uncertain, and of being wrought up to a perilously high-strung pitch. She felt as if she were panting for liberty to breathe, to express her discordant mood in some unconventional manner.  As it happened, the principal drawing-mistress, a highly decorous, self-controlled young woman, ten years Rose's senior, was absent, and her assistant was alone at her post, with the whole class in and on her hands. Rose had already taken off her hat and gloves, and she tried to compose her ruffled feelings before she began her round of the drawing-boards, as Mr. St. Foy inspected his easels. The analogy with its disproportion struck her, and moved her to silent, unsteady laughter, which she could not restrain, so that it broke out into a ringing peal at the first enormity in drawing which she came across.  Nobody laughed like that at the Misses Stone's --certainly no low-voiced, quietly conducted teacher. Rose was further aggrieved and tormented by the astonished heads privily raised, and the wondering eyes covertly looking at her. She laughed no more. She went on examining, commending, correcting, till she was tired out. Surely the morning hours were endless that day. She was exhausted, not merely by the \"smart walk\" from Welby Square, which, taken at Hester Jennings's pace, was always tiring, as Rose knew to her cost, but also by the turmoil of spirit she had been in. All the toils, disappointments, and drudgery of the life which lay before her seemed suddenly to press upon her and overwhelm her, and before she knew what she was doing she was sobbing behind her handkerchief. She had one grain of sense left, she turned her back; but her heaving shoulders and the muffled sound of a \"good cry\" were not hidden from the electrified class.  Nobody cried like that at the Misses Stone's, unless it might be to somebody's pillow in the darkness of the night. For any teacher to cry in her class was unheard of. Rose conquered herself in less time than it has taken to recount her weakness, and resumed the lesson with moist eyes, a reddened nose, and her whole girlish body tingling and smarting with girlish mortification. All the rest of the morning she seemed to hear two startling statements repeated alternately and without pause.  \"Miss Rose Millar laughed loudly in the middle of her teaching;\" and oh! shame of shames, for the womanly dignity of the last year of Rose's teens--\"Miss Rose Millar cried before the whole class.\"  Rose had once joined in a girls' play, full of girlish cleverness and girlish points and hits. No less a personage than Queen Elizabeth was introduced into it. In the course of the plot great stress was laid on the fact that the Queen had laughed at Lord Essex's expense, behind his back. This was done in order to pique the proud, spoilt young courtier to resent the laughter, and, in homely parlance, to give Her Majesty more to laugh at. The phrase \"_and the Queen laughed_,\" had been emphatically repeated again and again in Lord Essex's hearing, with much malicious meaning and effect.  That mocking quotation was resounding in Rose's ears with a characteristic variation. It was no longer \"_and the Queen laughed_,\" it was \"and Miss Rose Millar laughed,\" then alas! alas! as a fit pendant, \"and Miss Rose Millar cried.\"  What a big baby she had shown herself, without the decent reticence of a gentlewoman's good breeding, or the proper pride of a girl who respected herself. How these school-girls must despise her! What was she to do? Wait for the girls to whisper and chatter as all girls will, however trained? Or go at once to the Miss Stone with whom she had most to do, tell her the solecism of which she, Rose, had been guilty in the best behaved of schools, and abide by Miss Stone's decision, though it should be that she and her sisters would in future dispense with the services of Miss Rose Millar as assistant drawing-mistress.  Rose had the courage and honesty to adopt the latter course, and she tried to think that the fresh affront it brought her, was part of the penalty which she was bound to pay for her disgraceful childishness.  Miss Lucilla Stone listened with a little personal discomfiture, for she was, like Mrs. Jennings, so thoroughly mistress of herself and the situation, that any _gaucherie_ or boisterous indiscretion was positive pain to her. Besides, the bad example to the girls for whom Miss Lucilla and her sisters were responsible, made a matter which people who did not understand might wrongly consider a trifle, really a serious affair. \"No doubt,\" acquiesced Miss Lucilla, \"something had put you out, as you tell me,\" in low-voiced rebuke, which yet sunk Rose in the dust, deeper than she had been, when she was making her impulsive confession. \"You were tired with your walk, of course, but, my dear Miss Rose Millar, it is necessary to learn to practise self-control, especially in the presence of young people. They are so quick to notice and to encroach on their elders and those placed in authority over them, when the necessary distance of perfect self-control on the one side--if possible on both sides--is not preserved between them. Perhaps,\" added Miss Lucilla meditatively, and beginning to brighten a little, for she hated to give the lecture well-nigh as much as Rose hated to receive it, \"if you had swallowed just a teaspoonful of _sel-volatile_ or something of that kind, when you came in, the little scene would have been avoided. I shall speak to my sister Charlotte, who has the key of our medicine chest, and get her to administer a tiny dose to you every drawing day; you will step into the study the first thing, and it will be ready for you.\"  \"Oh, no, thank you, Miss Lucilla,\" exclaimed Rose hastily, \"I never took _sel-volatile_ in my life. Father says not one of us is hysterical, or is likely to faint on an emergency, not even Dora or May. He is quite proud of Annie--my sister Annie--for her nerve, and she needs it all, since she is in training for a nurse.\"  Miss Lucilla shook her head dubiously, whether at the modern institution of lady nurses, or at the superiority in nerve of any family to which Miss Rose Millar belonged.  \"You may not have been hysterical before,\" said Miss Lucilla with mild obstinacy; \"but that is no reason why you should not be so now. If you dislike _sel-volatile_, you ought to try red lavender drops. I know they have gone out of fashion, but my dear mother still used them and found much benefit from them till she was seventy-seven years of age.\"  Rose longed to say that there was a great gulf between seventy-seven and nineteen and two months. She was stopped by the quiet determination and self-satisfaction visible in Miss Lucilla's face and manner, as she rose and graciously but summarily dismissed the trespasser on her valuable time.  \"Yes, I hope this will meet the case. You have been overdoing yourself--that explains itself to everybody. Dear Mrs. Jennings must forbid you tea and coffee and limit you to cocoa in the meantime; indeed, my sisters and I take that precaution before any mischief appears. Don't forget Miss Stone's study the first thing on drawing mornings. I trust a little sedative and stimulant in one will prepare you nicely for the drawing lessons.\"  To Rose's disgust she was compelled to make wry faces and choke over so many doses of _sel-volatile_ and red lavender to the end of the term. She made secret unfulfilled threats to write to her father and get him to say that he would not permit her constitution to be tampered with, he would himself order her what she required, if she needed to be quieted like an incipient mad woman or a weak emotional fool.  Rose was not sure that Annie ought not to have come to her help. The younger sister did not see what advantage there was to the family in the elder sister's being a nurse if she was not to interfere on occasions of this kind. But Annie had the bad taste to take the story as a good joke against Rose; and as for Hester Jennings, it was an instance of \"_the Queen laughed_\" with a vengeance. However, Hester stepped in so far. She would not let the soothing regimen, on which Rose was put, go the length of depriving her of her tea and coffee in Welby Square.  Within the next few weeks Hester did Rose a still better turn. She (Hester) came to her friend with an order for decorative designs in scroll-work, which had reached the elder girl from a decorator of some repute.  \"I think you could do it, Rose,\" said Hester. \"It would not take much time, and if your work satisfied the great tradesman who has given such an impetus to this kind of art, it might be a perfect windfall to art students wishing to keep themselves. You need not despise it in the light of house-painting. If you read your Ruskin, you will find him as good as calling Titian and Veronese house-painters, though to be sure frescoes are rather an extension of scroll-work.\"  \"Indeed, I should never dream of despising it. I should be only too thankful for any kind of copying or pattern-drawing, or designing for Christmas-cards--like poor Fanny Russell--if it were the beginning of the least little bit of an order,\" said Rose meekly, with a stifled sigh given to her and May's old magnificent ideas of commissions. \"But why don't you keep the work for yourself, Hester?\" the young girl inquired. \"You could do it so well and so easily, and it would be no pain to you; it would be a pleasure, for it is graceful and true work so far as it goes--not like these cruel illustrations.\"  But Hester waived aside the undertaking. \"You have been more accustomed to this kind of thing than I have. No, I mean to stick to my illustrations, cruel or kind. There is a new man in the publisher's office who is giving me more of my own way, and I feel it would not be fair to leave him in the lurch. Who knows that we may not, between us, lead the way to a revolution in the style of the cheapest original English wood-cut. Besides, I do not want any more diversions from my main business. I am already on four different committees for women's trade unions, the female franchise, and all the rest of it. I must crib a little more time for my hand and foot. Don't you know?--Drawing my own hand and foot from their reflection in a looking-glass till I can put them in any position, and foreshorten them to my mind.\"  Rose competed for the scroll-work order, and did it so well that she got the order, and along with it a note of commendation, a tolerably large extension of the commission, and the first instalment of a liberal payment for the kind of work. Her elation knew no bounds--  \"Oh! Hester, I should never, never even have heard of this delightful job but for you. What can I ever do for you?\"  \"Don't hug me,\" said Hester, retreating in veritable terror, for she had a peculiar genuine aversion to caresses, still more than to thanks. \"Don't knock off my hat, for I cannot spare another minute to put it straight again.\"  The next thing Hester heard was a half-impetuous, half-shamefaced admission from Rose that she had resigned her post as assistant drawing-mistress at the Misses Stone's school.  Hester looked grave on the instant. \"What did you do that for?\" she demanded gruffly. \"Did you mention it to your sister? Have you told them at home?\"  \"No,\" Rose was forced to own--at least not till the deed was done. She had acted on her own responsibility. \"But indeed, Hester, it is the best plan,\" she argued volubly. \"Annie and all of them will say so when they know how I mean to cultivate this scroll-work, which is paying me twice as well already. I put it to you if I could do two things at once, and if it would be wise to sacrifice the more profitable for the less remunerative. Why it would be quite shortsighted and cowardly.\"  \"Humph,\" said Hester, without the smallest disguise, \"much experience you have had of it! Do you know, Rose Millar, these decorators' fads are constantly changing? Perhaps in three months they will all be for mosaic, or tiles, or peacocks' feathers again. If I had thought you were such a rash idiotic little goose, I should never have breathed a word to you of this man and his scroll-work.\"  \"Oh! but, Hester,\" pled Rose, determined not to be offended, \"I was only relieving the poor Misses Stone of a painful necessity. I am sure they have never put any dependence on me since the day I broke down--I grant you idiotically. I cannot stand the repression--suppression--whatever you like to call it. Now that there is a way out of it, I have felt like a wild beast in the school--the girls are so very tame--so much tamer than we were at Miss Burridge's--where I was not a black sheep--May will tell you if you care to ask her,\" protested Rose with wounded feeling. \"But I am so tired of the rosy and snowy cottages and the ruins, and of that long-nosed collie. Sometimes I feel as if I would give the world for him to wag his tail one day, just to give me an excuse for crying out and flinging my india-rubber at him. I wish May saw him; it might stop her ecstasies over her new acquisition--the brute at home. I feel that this other brute, and the rest of the Misses Stone's copies and models, are injuring my drawing--I know they are making it cramped; while the scrolls help my freedom of touch like Hogarth's line of beauty or Giotto's O. And it is such humbug, and so horrid to have to swallow these doses of _sel-volatile_--a great healthy girl like me!\"  \"Humph!\" said Hester again, \"I hope you may not repent what you have done--if so, you need not blame me.\"     CHAPTER XIV.  THE OLD TOWN, WITH ITS AIR STAGNANT YET TROUBLED. IS MAY TO BECOME A SCHOLAR OR A SHOP-GIRL?   The spring found Redcross still staggering under the failure of Carey's Bank. Hardly a week passed yet without some painful result of the disaster coming to light. These results had ceased to startle, there had been so many of them; but they still held plenty of interest for the fellow-sufferers, and Dora and May's letters were full of the details.  Bell Hewett had left Miss Burridge's; she had got a situation, or rather, she had been appointed to a junior form in the Girls' Day School at Deweshurst, going in the morning and returning in the afternoon by train. It was a good thing for Bell on the whole. She was more independent, had a recognized position as a public school-mistress, which she would not have had as a private governess; and if she continued to study, and passed various examinations, she might rise to higher and higher forms until she blossomed into a head-mistress--fancy Bell a head-mistress! She had quite a handsome salary, more than poor Ned's according to the chroniclers, Dora and May. That was the bright side of it. Unluckily for Bell, as most people thought, there was another. The daily journeys, together with the school-work, constituted a heavy task for a girl. Bell, toiling up from the railway station on a rainy day, with her umbrella ready to turn inside out, and her waterproof flying open, because her left hand, cramped and numb, was laden with a great bundle of exercises to correct at home, presented a dejected figure, tired out and three-fourths beaten. So the Miss Dyers thought as they rolled past her in their carriage, and debated whether they should not stop to pick her up and save her walking the rest of the road. But she was such a fright, positively bedraggled with mud enough to soil the cushions, and she could speak of nothing now save the Deweshurst Girls' Day School and her duties there. It was too tiresome to be borne with. Poor Bell was not clever, she was one-idea'd and slow at work like Ned, and she had also his conscientiousness. Probably promotion was not for her; she must drudge on as best she might. Her great encouragement at this time, next to her father's and sister's approbation and sympathy, was, as she told Dora, the prospect of spending her Easter holidays with Ned at his station-house. What did she care for its being only a station-house? after the fagging school-work it would be great fun to put Ned's small house in order, and play at housekeeping with him for a fortnight. She was bent on making him comfortable, and cheering him as well as herself. If the weather would but be fine they might have glorious rambles on the Yorkshire moors when no trains were due.  Colonel Russell was sailing once more for India, to lay his bones there without fail, the little Doctor prophesied sadly. In the meantime he had got, and been glad to get, a subordinate post in his old field. At the last moment, after he had established Mrs. Russell and her children in a cheerful house in Bath, he made up his mind to take his grown-up daughter out with him. But she was not to stay in his bungalow, for he was going to a small out-of-the-way station where there would be no accommodation or society in the barrack circle for a solitary young lady. Fanny was to be left with a cousin of her father's, in the Bombay Presidency. The lady had offered to take charge of her, and have her for a long visit.  Did Annie and Rose know what that meant? Could they form an indignant, affronted guess? \"Father said,\" Dora quoted, \"that if Colonel Russell, an honourable gentleman and gallant officer, had not lived in the old days and had his feelings blunted to the situation, he would never have consented to such an arrangement for his daughter. But he had seen his sisters come out to India for the well-understood purpose of getting married to any eligible man in want of a wife, so why should not Fanny do the same thing, when his pecuniary losses rendered it particularly desirable and the opportunity offered itself? It was not in Colonel Russell's eyes an unworthy resource. Of course Fanny was going out to be married and creditably disposed of within a given time, else her father would not have felt justified in paying her outfit and passage-money. Certainly he had no intention of paying her passage-money home as a single woman.\"  What would the Millars have done in Fanny's case? For was it not dreadful--particularly when all the young people interested in the subject remembered quite well that there had been \"something\" between Cyril Carey and Fanny Russell for more than a year back? Annie had always wondered what Fanny could see in a silly, trifling fop like Cyril. Rose had not been without a corresponding sense of wonder as to what Cyril could find in Fanny, who, in spite of her grand Norman peasant's carriage and profile, was dawdling and discontented with things in general, and though she pretended to a little knowledge of art, did not in the least understand what she was talking about. However, Annie's and Rose's opinions were of very little consequence when the matter concerned--not them--but Cyril and Fanny. There had been \"something\" between them which had changed the whole world to them last summer. They would never entirely outlive and forget it--not though Fanny went to far Cathay and married, not one, but half a dozen of Nabobs. For she was going to obey her father, and give herself to the first eligible bidder for her hand. No doubt she would do it with set lips, blanched face, and great black eyes looking not only twice as large as their natural size, but hollow and worn in the young face, because of the dark rings round them. These were produced by the sleepless nights which she pretended were occasioned by the hurry of her preparations, and of her having to say good-bye to all her old friends. But she would do it all the same.  Dora had only once caught Fanny Russell alone, and ventured on a timid, heart-felt expostulation.  \"Must you go to India, Fanny? We shall all miss you so much, and it is not as if you were to be with your father, but just to stay with a distant relative whom you have never seen; it does appear such a sacrifice.\"  \"And what should I do if I stayed behind papa, Dora?\" asked Fanny, turning upon her with those great burning eyes and parched lips. \"The house here is to be given up and the furniture sold immediately--of course you know that. It will take all that he can spare after discharging his share of the bank debts to keep Mrs. Russell and the children. I am a useless sort of person--a blank in the world. I could not nurse like Annie, or paint like Rose. I could not even be a school-mistress like Bell Hewett. Supposing I were qualified I should break down in a month. I was born in India, and spent the first five years of my life there, so that I am idle and languid, without stamina or moral courage; I am like the poor Bengalees, whom I can just remember. There is nobody who will undertake to keep me in England,\" ended Fanny, with a short, hard laugh.  And Dora, thinking of Cyril Carey--still one of the unemployed, with his old supercilious airs lost in the gait that was getting slouching, in keeping with the clothes becoming shabbier and shabbier, and the downcast, moody looks--could not find words with which to contradict her.  Indeed, when Dora was betrayed into giving her mother a hint of that \"something,\" unsuspected by the seniors of the circle, which had been between Cyril Carey and Fanny Russell, and rendered Fanny's destination still more heartless and hateful, Mrs. Millar took an entirely different view of the circumstances from that taken by her daughters, and was both indignant and intolerant. \"What presumption in Cyril Carey!\" broke out the gentle mother of marriageable daughters, full of righteous wrath. \"To dream of making up to a girl and perhaps engaging her simple affections, with the danger of breaking her heart and spoiling her prospects, when he had just failed to pass at college, and had not so much as a calling--not to say an income, with which to keep a wife! I shall think worse of him than I did before, after hearing this.\"  \"But you forget, mother,\" remonstrated Dora, \"that the bank was in existence then. His father might have been able to do something for Cyril.\"  \"He was not going to live on the bank's capital and credit. There was too much of that going on already with poor James Carey's encroaching, dishonest relations and their friends. And I beg to tell you, Dora, that a man who cannot help himself, but has to wait for his father to do something for him, is a very poor match for any girl. Fanny Russell is well rid of him. I have no doubt she will think so before she is many years older--that is, if this is not all a piece of foolish nonsense such as girls are apt to take into their heads about their companions. If there was anything in it, and she had not been going away, her father ought to have been warned, and Cyril Carey spoken to in the way he deserved--selfish scapegrace! As it is, the bare suspicion is enough to reconcile one to Fanny Russell's going out to India, though that custom for girls has fallen into disrepute, and I never had any liking for it. Still I hope that Fanny will soon make an excellent marriage, and will learn to laugh at Cyril Carey and his unwarrantable presumption, together with any girlish folly of which she may have been guilty.\"  Mrs. Millar spoke in another fashion to the little Doctor. She had happened to be at the railway station on the raw, chill morning when Fanny Russell, in her smart new gray travelling suit--part of her outfit--was put into a railway carriage by her father and left there alone, while he went to look after the luggage and find a smoking-carriage for himself.  Fanny sat like a statue. She did not even raise her veil when she was bidding farewell to Lucy Hewett and Dora, who were seeing her off--not to take a last look at Redcross, where she had spent her youth.  Mrs. Millar understood it better when she stumbled against Cyril Carey half hidden by a lamp-post, watching the vanishing train. She might have taken the opportunity to rebuke him for his unprincipled recklessness; instead of doing so--after one glance at the young fellow's haggard face--the ordinary words of greeting died away on the kind woman's lips. She turned aside in another direction, making as if she had not seen him, without breathing a word of the encounter until she had her husband's ear all to herself in the privacy of the dining-room.  \"O Jonathan!\" she said, \"I am so glad, so thankful that you did not interfere and use any influence, any pressure on Dora about Tom Robinson. I think it would have broken my heart to see any daughter of mine going off as Fanny Russell went to-day, leaving the look I declare I beheld on that poor lad's face. I should not wonder though she has given him the last push on the road to destruction.\"  \"Oh, come now; it is not so bad as that,\" protested Dr. Millar, and then he was guilty of a most audacious paraphrase of a piece of schoolboy slang, for which he had some excuse in the habits of his wife--\"Keep your cap on, Maria. In the first place, I see no analogy between the cases. Dora had not a private love affair--at least I was never told of it.\"  \"Father, what are you thinking of? A private love affair in this house! It was very different with poor Fanny Russell, who had only her silly, selfish young stepmother between her and her father. I dare say she would never have looked at an empty coxcomb like Cyril Carey if she had been happy at home.\"  \"And did I not hear you say,\" asked the gentleman, who had before now been made the recipient of the disastrous complication of the story, \"that the girl was well quit of the jackanapes, for she could not have a worse bargain made for her than she had nearly blundered into on her own account?\"  \"Yes, I did say so,\" the lady admitted, when thus brought to book; \"and I'd say it again, if I had not seen that miserable, desperate expression on his face, and he so young, and such a light-hearted, foolish dandy only the other day. I may be sorry for him, I suppose, though I have no son of my own. And I am grieved for poor James Carey, who is breaking up so fast, and for poor, poor Mrs. Carey.\"  It was a positive relief when Dr. Millar came in one day and announced that he had a piece of good news for the family, by far the best where the Careys were concerned that he had heard for many a day. Cyril had got an appointment at last; he had been offered the command of the mounted police at Deweshurst.  \"A policeman. Oh! what a downfall,\" cried Mrs. Millar and Dora. But when the Doctor reminded them that there were policemen and policemen, insisted on the fact that the practice of placing gentlemen at the head of the constabulary was gaining ground, and asked them what they had been in the habit of calling Colonel Shaw and Sir Edmund Henderson when they were the chiefs of the London police, his womankind gave in.  Mrs. Carey did not say there would be another mouth less for her to feed, but she remarked, with the same sardonic calmness, that Cyril's clothes would be provided for him, which would be one good thing. Cyril himself was only too glad to get away. He would have something to do, however unpalatable in itself, instead of digging in the garden, and going through the form of helping Robinson, his clerks, and cashier, with their books. He would have a good horse under him once more, if he were only to ride it to police drill.  Dora could not be sure whether he experienced a throb of thankfulness at the thought that this had not happened till Fanny Russell was gone. Where was constancy to draw the line? A man was not less a man because he was also a mounted policeman. He might even be grandiloquently styled, by those who were particular about the names of things, the soldier of peace. Still Dora had an irresistible conception of the pained disdain, the latent superciliousness, which would have sprung into full force in Fanny's dark eyes, if she had ever seen the once magnificent Cyril in the most careful modification of a _bobby's_ braided tunic and helmet.  Bell Hewett would not look so, if she, in her school-mistress character, met Cyril at Deweshurst. Bell, like Dora, would feel her heart soften and warm to Cyril in his misfortunes. She would think of Ned, and hurry up to Ned's old playfellow and chum, to tell him the last news from Yorkshire, and ask what message from him she should send to Ned in her next letter. Dora was tempted to go on and wonder whether Cyril's heart would not be touched in turn by the cordial recognition of his Rector's daughter, who had, on the whole, kept her position better than he, with his advantages, had kept his, whose frank greeting had become a kind of credential of gentle birth and breeding afforded to him in full sight of the natives of Deweshurst. If he felt all that, he must recognize how womanly and sweet Bell was, though she was not pretty and not one bit clever, and be full of gratitude to her. And gratitude combined with considerable isolation on the one hand, and on the other the constantly present possibility of agreeable encounters with a loyal old friend, might lead to anything--to a good deal more than Dora cared to say even to herself, feeling frightened at the length to which she had gone on the spur of the moment in this most recklessly unworldly match-making. Yet was it reckless, when Bell would be such a good poor man's wife, and when marriage with a woman like Bell might make another man of Cyril Carey?  However, the Careys' adversity, with its reaction on their old associates, approached a climax shortly after Cyril left. His father grew so much more helpless an invalid that it was found absolutely necessary to have a resident nurse for him. Then Mrs. Carey, though she continued the nurse-in-chief, stated clearly and dispassionately that she was now sufficiently disengaged to look after her house and give her single servant what assistance she required. Therefore, as it was high time that Phyllis should be doing something for herself, Mrs. Carey proposed to put her at once into \"Robinson's,\" under Miss Franklin, if Mr. Robinson would receive Phyllis for an apprentice.  It was in vain that Phyllis cried and implored her mother to take back her resolution, and that all her friends apprised of the proposed step remonstrated; Dr. Millar even called expressly to enter his protest.  Mrs. Carey would hear of no objections. Phyllis must do something for herself, and she was not clever or qualified in any way to be a governess. Mrs. Carey had every confidence in \"Robinson's\" as an excellent shop, conducted on the best principles. She had a great respect for both Mr. Robinson and Miss Franklin--she would never find a more desirable place for Phyllis. As to cutting her off from all her connections and the circumstances of her birth and education, that had been done already pretty effectually. The sooner everybody found his or her level the better for the world in general. If Mrs. Carey was not much mistaken, more girls than Phyllis would have to learn that lesson before these hard times were over. No, it was not Phyllis who was to be cut off from her connections--from those who ought to be nearest and dearest to her. It was poor Ella who was separated from the rest of the family, and condemned to gilded exile. Mrs. Carey was doing her best to keep Phyllis, not only for her mother and her poor father, but for her brothers, who must all start in life in a humble way, by putting the girl into \"Robinson's,\" since Mr. Robinson had reluctantly consented to have her.  Dr. Millar retired from the field beaten.  The unheard-of destination of her friend Phyllis played the most extraordinary pranks with May Millar's mind. The fact was, there were two Mays dwelling side by side in one goodly young tabernacle of flesh. There was the May with the exceptional scholarly proclivities. She had a life of her own into which none of the family except her father possessed so much as the tools to penetrate. She cherished dreams of Greece and Rome, with the mighty music of the undying voices of their sages and poets, and the rich treasures of learning, among which a poor little English girl, far far down in the centuries, could only walk with reverend foot and bated breath.  And there was the other May, hanging about her mother, running to bring her father's slippers, sitting on his knee to this day, taking possession of Dora, ordering her about like a young tyrant, adoring Tray--the most guileless, helpless, petted simpleton of a child-woman that ever existed. The second May was at the present date the more prominent and prevailing of the two, so much so that all the sharp-tongued, practical-minded ladies in Redcross made a unanimous remark. Dr. and Mrs. Millar's youngest daughter was the most disgracefully spoilt, badly brought-up, childish creature for her years whom the critics knew. It was a poor preparation in view of her having to work to maintain herself. They could not tell what was to become of her.  At first May lamented, day and night, over the fate of Phyllis Carey, to have to stand behind counters, sort drawers full of ribands, tape, and reels of cotton, and wait on her townswomen! May could think of no fitting parallel unless the pathetic one of that miserable young princess apprenticed to the button-maker, dying with her cheek on an open Bible, at the text, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\"  Then, as Phyllis accommodated herself to the new yoke, and found it not so galling as she had expected it to be, her friend May altered her tone with sympathetic quickness, and reflected Phyllis's change of mood almost before the mood was established. Phyllis was in mental constitution like her father, single-hearted and submissive--not bright any more than Bell Hewett was bright, but contented and trustful as long as she was suffered to be so. She had been enduring harder and harder lines at home. She found existence actually brightening instead of darkening round her when she was transferred to \"Robinson's.\" For everybody, knowing all about her and her father and mother, with their altered circumstances, began, at least, by treating her with kindly respect and forbearance, in spite of Mrs. Carey's austere request that she should be dealt with exactly like the other shop-girls.  Shop-work, in which Phyllis was to be gradually trained, felt comparatively easy to a girl who had been taken from school and launched into the coarsest drudgery of house-work under an inexperienced, flurried, over-burdened maid-of-all-work. Mrs. Carey was sufficiently just to exact no more home-work from Phyllis, and to arrange that she should have her time to herself, like other shop-girls, after \"Robinson's\" was closed, while the master of \"Robinson's\" was inflexible in setting his face against late hours, except for the elder hands on one evening in the week. Everybody was good to Phyllis, who, in truth, just because she was enough of a little lady to be free from arrogance and assumption, while she was willing to do her best to oblige her neighbours, provoked no harsh treatment. Above all Tom Robinson for one person could not be too considerate to her.  Miss Franklin looked on Phyllis Carey as a godsend, a harbinger of other better-class girls going into trade. The woman not only took the girl under her wing, she fell back instinctively and inevitably on Phyllis for companionship, with a selection flattering in a woman to a girl.  Then a complete revolution was wrought in May's opinions and wishes. Nothing would serve her but that she too must go as a shop-girl to \"Robinson's,\" and share the fortunes of her friend.  May did not yet confide her purpose to her father and mother, but she poured it in daily and nightly outbursts into the startled ears of Dora, to whom the hallucination sounded like a mocking retribution on the young Millars' old scornful estimate of shopkeepers and shops. May stuck to her point with a tenacity which, touching as it did a tender, trembling chord in Dora's heart, threatened also to subvert her judgment, that was at once sounder and more matured than May's.  The vibrating chord lay in the knowledge that May too was destined to quit Redcross at no distant day, with the aching reluctance of Dora to give her up, and to find herself in the position that domineering, selfish girls sometimes covet--that of being the only girl at home, having none to share with her in the rights and privileges of the daughter of the house.  A sort of feverish anxiety, which was in itself ominous, had taken hold of Dr. Millar to see all he had projected accomplished in so far as it was still possible. That is, he would fain set in motion, at least, the wheels which would carry out his purpose. Perhaps he had reason to distrust his health and life; perhaps it was simply that he was not insensible to the fact, that money had a trick of running through his fingers and those of Mrs. Millar like water, though they did their best to catch it up and arrest it in its rapid course. Mrs. Millar's little private income was still in part free, and not engulfed in the needs of the household at Redcross, as it might not long continue. Rose had only sixty pounds of it, and Annie fifteen for pocket-money till she should have passed her probation and be in a position to receive her nurse's salary, which would be as soon as she had completed her first year in the hospital. There were seventy-five pounds remaining, which might serve to keep May at Thirlwall Hall in St. Ambrose's with the chance of her gaining a scholarship and partly maintaining herself for the rest of her stay in college. \"Little May's\" maintaining herself in any degree was a notion half to laugh at, half to cry over, while it took possession of Dr. Millar's imagination just as serving in \"Robinson's\" along with Phyllis Carey had hold of May's.  Another year (who knew?) it might not be in the Millars' power to afford May the opportunity of growing up a scholar, on which her father had set his heart. That consciousness, and the sense of the value which her husband put on May's abilities and their culture, brought round Mrs. Millar. She began to contemplate with something like composure what she would otherwise have strongly objected to, the sending forth of her youngest darling--the child who so clung to her and to home--into an indifferent or hostile world.  Truth to tell, it was May herself who was the great obstacle. She was not cast in the heroic mould of Annie and Rose. It was like tearing up her heart-strings to drag her away from her father and mother, Dora, Tray, the Old Doctor's House, Redcross itself. She had enough perception of what was due to everybody concerned--herself included--and just sufficient self-control not to disgrace herself and vex her father by openly opposing and actively fighting against his plans for her welfare. But she threw all the discouraging weight of a passive resistance and dumb protest into the scale.     CHAPTER XV.  TOM ROBINSON TAKEN INTO COUNSEL.   At last May, in the innocence of her heart, took a rash step. She heard her father say it was good, showery, fishing weather, and she was aware Tom Robinson often fished in the Dewes; what was to hinder her from making a detour by the river on her way home from school, and if she saw Tom near the old bridge--the pools below were specially patronized by fishers--she might go up to him and ask him frankly if he had an opening for her services, along with those of Phyllis Carey, in his shop? If he had, would he do her the great favour to speak to her father and mother, and ask them not to send her away to be a scholar at St. Ambrose, but to let her stay and be a shop-woman in Redcross?  Tom Robinson, at the first word of her appeal, put up his fishing-rod, slung his basket, in which there were only a couple of fish, on his back, shouldered her books, and turned and walked back with her, as if it was he who was seeking her company and not she his. How else was he to make the little girl who might have been his pet sister see that there was any harm in the irregular course she had pursued? How, otherwise, was she to understand that she was big enough--nearly a head taller than her sister Dora--and old enough with her seventeen years, though she was still the child of the family, to render it indecorous for her to come, out of her own head, without the knowledge of anybody, to have a private interview with him on the banks of the Dewes?  \"'Robinson's' is highly honoured,\" he told her, in a tone partly bantering, partly serious, and wholly friendly, \"and I too should, and do, thank you for the trust in me which your proposal implies, but I am afraid it would not do, Miss May.\"  May's fair young face fell.  \"Oh! I am so sorry,\" she said simply; \"but, please, may I know why you have Phyllis and will not have me?\"  \"The case is altogether different. Mrs. Carey made up her mind that Miss Phyllis should go into a shop--mine or another's. Phyllis was not happy at home; she is not a clever, studious girl, though she is your friend and is very nice--of course all young ladies are nice. There is no comparison between you and her.\"  \"But why shouldn't clever people go and work in shops?\" persisted May, in her half-childish way--\"not that I mean I am clever; that would be too conceited. But I am sure it would be a great deal better for shops if they had the very cleverest people to work in them.\"  \"It depends on the kind of cleverness,\" he told her. \"With regard to one sort you are right, of course; with respect to another it would not answer, and it would be horrible waste.\"  She opened her brown eyes wide. \"Why do you waste your abilities and college education?\" she asked him navely--\"not that everybody calls it a waste; some people say 'Robinson's' is the high-class shop it is, because its masters have not only been respectable people, they have always been educated men and gentlemen.\"  \"I ought to say for myself and my predecessors that I am much obliged to 'some people' for acknowledging that,\" he remarked coolly.  \"I beg your pardon, Mr. Robinson,\" said May humbly. \"I know I have been very rude--I am constantly saying stupid things.\"  \"Not at all; and though you did, never mind--say them to me if you like,\" he gave her _carte blanche_ to comfort her. \"But look here, Miss May, I don't wish you to make mistakes. Indeed it is my duty, since I am a great deal older than you--old enough to be, well, your uncle I should say--to prevent it if I can.\"  \"I don't see how you could be my uncle,\" said May bluntly, \"when you are not more than five or six years older than Annie--I have heard her say so--you are more like my brother.\"  The instant she mentioned the relationship to which he had aspired in vain, she felt the blood tingling to her finger-tips, and she could see him redden under the shade of his soft felt hat.  May groaned inwardly. \"Oh! I am a blundering goose; I wonder anybody can be so infatuated as to think me clever.\"  \"I have not said what I wished to say,\" he resumed, for somehow, in spite of her forgetfulness and lack of tact, he could talk well enough to May. \"I must set you right. I have not a grain of the scholar in me such as you have, neither do I believe that those who went before me had; we could never have been more than fair students. We did not go out of our way to get learning. We did what our associates and contemporaries did, that was all. I fancy I may take the small credit to us of saying that we had no objection to learn what the ancients thought, saw, and did, after we had been lugged through the Latin grammar and caned into familiarity with Greek verbs. We were like other men who had the same advantages. I honestly believe if we had anything special and individual about us it was a turn for trade. That is the only manner in which I can account for our sticking to the shop, unless we were mere money-grubbers. But all that signifies very little; what does signify is that you are not quite like other girls. What, May, do you pretend that you do not prize the roll of a sonorous passage, or the trip of an exquisite phrase in Latin or Greek? That it does not tickle your ears, cling to your memory, and haunt you as a theme in music haunts a composer? Do you not care to go any deeper in Plato or in the dramatists? Is it a fact that you can bear to have heard the last of Antigone, and Alcestis, and Electra?\"  May hung her head like one accused of gross unfaithfulness, with some show of reason.  \"No, I cannot say that, Mr. Robinson,\" she owned, \"I shall think and dream of them all my life. They are so grand and persecuted and sad. But there--if I do not turn my back on them and my books, I must go to St. Ambrose's, there is no choice,\" ended May disconsolately.  \"But why not go to St. Ambrose's?\"  \"Oh! you do not know, Mr. Robinson,\" protested May with fresh energy. \"In the first place you are a man and cannot understand. In the second, I suppose it is because I am so silly and childish and cowardly,\" she went on incoherently. \"Annie always said it was cowardly; she and Rose went away quite bravely and cheerfully, keeping up their own and everybody's spirits to the last. But Dora and I could not do it, yet I do not know that anybody ever thought of calling our Dora cowardly exactly, or silly, and childish. She was not a bit cowardly with the horrid big dog and dear little Tray, you remember?--she would not let me interfere, but she would have stoned the dog herself.\"  \"Which would have been very foolish of her,\" said Tom Robinson with decision. \"I should say she was timid, not cowardly--there is a broad distinction between the two conditions.\"  \"It is just that we cannot leave home for any length of time, Dora and I,\" said May piteously.  \"So you and your sister Dora cannot leave home--that is the objection, is it?\" he repeated, slowly pulling his red moustache. \"What do you call home? The Old Doctor's House or Redcross?\"  \"Both,\" cried May quickly; \"where father and mother and the rest of us are, of course.\"  \"But the rest of you are gone, and what if your father and mother were to go too?\"  \"They won't, they never will,\" insisted May--\"not until they come to die. You were not meaning that? Oh! you could not be so cruel, so barbarous,\" cried May, passionately, \"when death is such a long way off, I trust. I know that God is good whether we live or die, and that we shall meet again in a better world. But we are not parted yet, and it is not wrong to pray that we may be a long time together here on this very earth, which we know so well, where we have been so happy. Why, father and mother are not more than middle-aged--mother is not, and if father is older, he is as strong and hale as anybody. Think how he was able to give up his carriage and attend his patients on foot last autumn without feeling it,\" urged the girl defiantly, in her passion of love and roused dread, which she would not admit.  \"Certainly,\" he strove to reassure her, feeling himself a savage for frightening her by his inadvertence, \"I never saw anybody wear so well as Dr. Millar. He might be sixty or fifty--he may live to be a hundred--I hope with all my heart he will; and I shall not be astonished if I live to see it. As for Mrs. Millar, it is an insult to call her middle-aged. It is something quite out of keeping to come across her with such a tall daughter as you are.\"  \"Yes, I am the tallest of the four,\" exclaimed May complacently, diverted from the main topic, as he had intended her to be. \"And I have not done growing yet; my last summer's frock had to be let down half an inch.\"  \"Is it possible? What are we all coming to? You will soon have to stoop to take my arm--if you ever condescend to take my arm.\"  \"No,\" she denied encouragingly, \"I am not so far above your shoulder now,\" measuring the distance with a critical eye. \"I shall not grow so much as that comes to. You are bigger than father, and you would not call him a little man; you are hardly even short.\"  \"Thanks, you are too kind,\" said Tom Robinson, with the utmost gravity. \"But I say, Miss May, if I were you, I don't think I should do anything to vex and thwart Dr. Millar, though he is so strong and active--long may he continue so. You know how disappointed he would be if you were to close your books.\"  \"I am afraid he would,\" said May reluctantly. \"I had almost forgotten all about it for the last minute or two. But don't you think if you spoke to him as I came to ask if you would,\" she continued unblushingly and coaxingly, \"if you were to try and show him--it would be so kind of you--how comfortable and happy I should be with Phyllis Carey in your shop--doing my best--indeed, I should try hard to please you and Miss Franklin, all day--and getting home every evening--he might change his mind?\"  \"No, he would not,\" said Tom with conviction; \"and what is more, he ought not. He would never cease to regret his shattered hopes for you--which, remember, you would have shattered--and your spoilt life.\"  \"But your life is not spoilt?\" she said wistfully, unable to resign her last hope.  \"How can you tell?\" he said, with a slight sharpness in his accent. Then he added quickly, \"No, for I am a born shopkeeper in another sense than because I am one of a nation of shopkeepers.\"  He gave himself a reassuring shake, and resumed briskly--\"I crave leave to say, Miss May, that I actually enjoy making up accounts, turning over samples, and giving orders. Sometimes I hit on a good idea which the commercial world acknowledges, and then I am as proud as if I had unearthed an ancient manuscript, or found the philosopher's stone. I pulled a fellow through a difficulty the other day, and it felt like taking part in an exciting fight. I have speculated occasionally when I was fishing--paying myself a huge compliment, no doubt--whether old Izaak Walton felt like me about trade.\"  \"Was he in trade?\" inquired May, with some surprise. \"I know he wrote _The Complete Angler_, and was a friend of Dr. Donne's and George Herbert's, and is very much thought of to this day.\"  \"Deservedly,\" said Tom Robinson emphatically. \"Yes, I am proud to say, he was a hosier to begin with, and a linen-draper to end with--well-to-do in both lines. They say his first wife, whom he married while he was still in business, was a niece of the Archbishop of Canterbury of the day, and his second wife, whom he married after he had retired to live on his earnings, was a half-sister of good Bishop Ken's; but I do not pretend to vouch for the truth of these statements. Now, about your father. I cannot do what you ask--I cannot in conscience. Will you ever forgive me, 'little May'--that is what your father and mother and your sisters call you sometimes to this day, ain't it? and it is what I should have called you if I had been--your uncle say? Shall we be no longer friends?\" he demanded ruefully.  \"Of course we shall,\" said May, with a suspicion of petulance. \"You are not bound to do what I bid you--I never thought that; and you are father and mother's friend--how could I help being your friend?\"  \"Don't try to help it,\" he charged her.  Tom Robinson went farther than not feeling bound to do what May begged of him, he was constrained to remonstrate in another quarter to prevent trouble and disappointment to all concerned. He screwed up his courage, and everybody knows he was a modest man, and called at the Old Doctor's House for the express purpose. He had called seldom during the past year--just often enough to keep up the form of visiting--to show that he was not the surly boor, without self-respect or consideration for the Millars, which he would have been if he had dropped all intercourse with the family because one of them had refused to marry him. But though he had begged for Dora's friendship when he could not have her love, and had meant what he said, the wound was too recent for him to act as if nothing had happened. In addition to the pain and self-consciousness, there was a traditional atmosphere of agitation and alarm, a kind of conventional awkwardness, together with an anxious countenance, and protection sedulously afforded by the initiated and interested spectators to Tom and Dora, which, like many other instances of countenance and protection, went far towards doing the mischief they were intended to prevent.  Tom saw through the punctilious feints and solemn stratagems clearly; Dora did the same as plainly. Indeed the two would have been idiots if they could have escaped from the discomfiting perception of the care which was taken of them and their feelings, and the fact that every eye was upon them.  The sole result was to render the couple more wretchedly uncomfortable than if they had been set aside and sentenced to the company of each other and of no one else for a bad five minutes every day of their lives.  Another unhappy consequence of their being thus elaborately spared and shielded was, that when by some unfortunate chance the tactics failed, the couple felt as flurried and guilty as if they had contrived the fruitless accident to serve their own nefarious ends.  Tom Robinson called on the Millars between four and five the day after May had made her raid upon him, expecting to find what was left of the family gathering together for afternoon tea. He had the ulterior design of drawing May's father and mother apart, and letting them judge for themselves the advisability of her going up at once to St. Ambrose's, before her whole heart and mind were disastrously set against her natural and honourable destiny. He was distinctly put out by finding Dora alone. As for Dora, she told a faltering tale of her father's having been called away to a poor patient who was a pensioner of her mother's, and of Mrs. Millar's having walked over to Stokeleigh with him to see what she could do for old Hannah Lightfoot; while May was spending the afternoon with the Hewetts at the Rectory.  He hesitated whether to go or stay under the circumstances, but he hated to beat an ignominious retreat, as if _he_ thought that _she_ thought he could not be beside her for a quarter of an hour without making an ass of himself again and pestering her. Why should he not accept the cup of tea which she faintly offered from the hands that visibly trembled with nervousness? When he came to consider it, why should he not transact his business with Dora? She was as deeply interested as anybody, unless the culprit herself; she probably knew better what May was foolishly planning than either their father or mother did, and would convey to them the necessary information.  As for Dora, she was thinking in a restless fever, \"I hope--I hope he does not see how much I mind being alone with him. It is just because I am not used to it. How I wish somebody would come in,--not mother, perhaps, for she would start and look put out herself, and sit down without so much as getting rid of her sunshade; and, oh dear, not May, for she would stare, and I do not know what on earth she would think--some wild absurdity, I dare say; anyhow, she would look exactly what she thought.\"  \"Look here, Miss Dora,\" he said abruptly; \"you don't think your sister May ought to renounce the object of her education hitherto, and your father's views for her, in order to do like Miss Phyllis Carey? You are aware that May has become enamoured of Phyllis Carey's example, and is bent on following in her footsteps; but it won't do, and I have told her so. I trust nobody suspects me of encouraging young ladies to become shop-women,\" he added, with a slightly foolish laugh, \"as old actors used to be accused of decoying young men of rank and fashion into going on the stage, and recruiting sergeants of beguiling country bumpkins into taking the king's shilling.\"  \"Has May spoken to you about it?\" cried Dora, startled out of her engrossing private reflections. \"What a child she is! I am sorry she has troubled you; she ought not to have done that. I hope you will excuse her.\"  \"Don't speak of it,\" he said a little stiffly, as he put down his cup and signified he would have no more tea.  \"And you said no,\" remarked Dora, with an involuntary fall of her voice reflecting the sinking of her heart. \"Of course you could not do otherwise. It was a foolish notion. I am afraid Phyllis Carey is enough of a nuisance to Miss Franklin--and other people. It is hard that you should be bothered by these girls. Only I suspect poor 'little May' will be most dreadfully, unreasonably disappointed;\" and there was an attempt to smile and a quiver of the soft lips which she could not hide.  \"I am not bothered, and I hate to disappoint your sister,--I trust you understand that,\" he said quickly and earnestly. \"But it would be sacrificing her and overturning your father's arrangements for her--disappointing what I am sure are among his dearest wishes.\"  She did not ask, like May, why he did not count himself sacrificed. She only said shyly and wistfully, \"I knew it was out of the question, but if it had not been so, or if there had been any other way, it would have been such a boon to poor May not to be torn from home.\" At the harrowing picture thus conjured up her voice fairly shook, and the tears started into her dovelike eyes.  \"Home,\" he said impatiently, \"is not everything; at least, not the home from which every boy must go, as a matter of course. 'Torn from home' in order to go to school! Surely the first part of the sentence is tall language.\"  \"It is neither too tall nor too strong where May is concerned,\" said Dora, rousing herself to plead May's cause. \"She has not been away from home and from father--especially from mother, and one or other of the rest of us, for longer than a week since she was born.\"  \"Then the sooner she begins the better for her,\" he said brutally, as it sounded to himself, to the loving, shrinking girl he was addressing.  \"She has always been the little one, the pet,\" urged Dora; \"she will not know what to do without some of us to take care of her and be good to her.\"  \"But she must go away some day,\" he continued his remonstrance. \"How old is your sister?\"  \"She was seventeen last Christmas,\" Dora answered shamefacedly.  \"Why, many a woman is married before she is May's age,\" he protested. \"Many a woman has left her native country, gone among strangers, and had to maintain her independence and dignity unaided, by the time she was seventeen. Queen Charlotte was not more than sixteen when she landed in England and married George the Third.\"  Dora could not help laughing, as he meant her to do. \"May and Queen Charlotte! they are as far removed as fire and water. But,\" she answered meekly, \"I know the Princess Royal was no older when she went to Berlin; and poor Marie Antoinette was a great deal younger, as May would have reminded me if she had been here, in the old days when she travelled from Vienna to Paris. But there--it is all so different. They were princesses from whom a great deal is expected, and the Princess Royal was the eldest instead of the youngest of the Queen's children.\"  \"Does seniority make so great a difference?\" he said, with an inflection of his voice which she noticed, though he hastened to make her forget it by speaking again gravely the next minute. \"Should May not learn to stand alone? Would it not be dwarfing and cramping her, all her life probably, to give way to her now. Can it ever be too early to acquire self-reliance, and is it not one of the most necessary lessons for a responsible human being to learn? Besides, '_ce n'est que le premier pas qui coute_.' It is only the first wrench which will hurt her. She will find plenty of fresh interests and congenial occupations at St. Ambrose's. In a week, a fortnight, she will not miss you too much.\"  Dora shook her head incredulously. It was little he knew of May, with her fond family attachments, and her helplessness when left to herself in common things.  \"Follow my advice, Miss Dora,\" he said, rising to take his leave, \"don't aid and abet Miss May in seeking to shirk her obligations. Unquestionably the one nearest to her at present is that she should go to St. Ambrose's. Don't prevent her from beginning to think and act for herself--not like a charming child, but in the light of her dawning womanhood.\"  He gave a swift glance round him as he spoke, and a recollection which had been in the background of both their thoughts during the whole of the interview, flashed into the foreground. It was of that day a year ago, a breezy spring day like this, when, as it seemed, there were the same jonquils in the jar on the chimney-piece, and the same cherry-blossom seen through the window against the blue sky, and he had asked her with his heart on his lips, and the happiness of his life at stake, to be his wife, and she had told him, with agitation and distress almost equal to his, that he could never be anything to her. He caught her half-averted eyes, and felt the whole scene was present with her as with him once more, and the consciousness brought back all his old shyness and reserve, and hurried his leave-taking. The slightest touch to her hand, and he had bowed himself out and was gone.  \"How silly he must think me,\" Dora reflected, walking up and down the empty room in perturbation, \"both about poor 'little May,' and about remembering the last time we were alone together. I dare say he is right about May, though men never do understand what girls feel. If she should fall ill, and break her heart, and die of home-sickness--such things have happened before now--I wonder what he would say then about her learning to stand alone? Very likely he would assert that St. Ambrose's is not St. Petersburg, or even Shetland or the Scilly Isles. It is not far away, and if she were not well or happy, she could come back in half a day, as the other girls could come down from London. But then he would despise her, for as quiet and good-natured as he is, and though people have said that he himself had no proper pride in consenting to have a shop. And I don't think May could bear contempt from anybody whom she had ever looked on as a friend. Men are hard--the best of them are, and they don't understand. He is kind--I am sure he means it all in kindness; but he is not yielding; he is as masterful as when he dragged the dogs to the edge of the bank and let them drop into the Dewes for their good. He will never be turned from what he thinks right. I wish he had not guessed what I could not help remembering--he was quick enough in doing that; and I could not tell him that I did not imagine for a moment--I was not so foolish--that he was under the same delusion he suffered from twelve months ago. If he had been oftener here in the interval, and we had met and been together naturally as we used to be, sometimes, I should have forgotten all about it, and so would he, no doubt. But how could I help thinking of it when there has always been such a point made of mother or some one else being present when he called? I am certain it is quite unnecessary and a great mistake. He will not speak to me again as he spoke that day. There is no danger of his running away with me,\" Dora told herself with an unsteady laugh. \"I hope he is not under the impression that I did not think and act for myself when I was forced to do it. Because, although they all knew about it, and of course Annie and the others teased me about 'Robinson's,' and the colour of his hair, and his size, father and mother told me to decide for myself, and I did not hesitate for a moment. I could no more have borne to leave them all of my own free will than May could. Surely it was proof positive I did not like him in that way,\" Dora represented to herself with the greatest emphasis.  Tom Robinson was marching home with his hands in his pockets and his hat drawn over his eyes. \"How hard she must think me--little short of a pragmatical, supercilious brute--not to do my best to keep 'little May' at home, where the child wants to be. I asked her to let me call myself her friend, and this is the first specimen of my friendship! she will take precious good care not to ask for another. She will be horribly dull left by herself without one girl companion, only the old people. These sisters were so happy together--I liked to see them, perhaps all the more because I had neither brothers nor sisters of my own--I thought it was an assurance of what they might be in other relations of life. I suppose she will tackle that little spitfire of a dog which I inflicted on them. May will lay her parting injunctions on Dora to plague herself perpetually with the monster, and these will be like dying words to Dora, she will sooner die herself than intermit a single harassing attention. And it will be impossible for her to avoid many deprivations. There are more partings to be faced in the future. Millar is an old man, even if he could hope to pay up the bank's calls and make some provision for his widow and daughters. It was a pity poor Dora could not care for me, when there need have been no partings where we two were concerned, save that material separation of death which is quoted in the marriage service. She would not have believed, nor I either, that it could touch the spiritual side of the question and the love which is worth having, that is God-like and belongs to immortality. I might have done what I could if Dora had married me, so far as the other girls would have let me, to serve as a buffer between the family and the adversity which I am afraid not all their high spirit and gallant fight will hold entirely at bay. It was not to be, and there is an end on't. I wonder where I found the heart, and the cheek too for that matter, to bully Dora about May, though, Heaven knows, I spoke no more than the truth. Well, she has her revenge, and I am punished for it. It cut me up at the time to hurt her, and the recollection of having contradicted and pained so sweet and gentle a creature is very much as if I had dealt a lamb a blow or wrung a pigeon's neck--on principle.\"  Half an hour afterwards Mrs. Millar bustled into her drawing-room with an expression of mingled annoyance and excited expectation on her still comely face.  \"My dear Dora, I am so sorry; he gave his name to Jane, and she has told me who has been calling in my absence. I wish I had not left you by yourself. But who was to guess that Tom Robinson would call this afternoon? It must have been exceedingly disagreeable for you.\"  \"I don't know,\" said Dora, vaguely and desperately; \"we must meet sometimes when there is nobody by, if we continue to live in the same town. I wish you would not mind it for me, mother, and keep on trying to avoid such accidents, for I really think it makes them worse when they do happen.\"  \"Very well, my dear, you know your own feelings best,\" said Mrs. Millar, a little puzzled. In her day it was reckoned no more than what was due to maidenly delicacy and social propriety to preserve a respectful distance between a rejected man and his rejector. As if the gentleman might, as Dora had said, carry off the lady by force, or shoot her or himself with the pistol hidden in his breast!     CHAPTER XVI.  ROSE'S FOLLY AND ANNIE'S WISDOM.   Annie Millar not only warmed to her work in St. Ebbe's, she recovered her full glow of health and spirits. She not only liked her nursing, she enjoyed her holiday hours intensely with the peculiarly keen enjoyment of busy women doing excellent service in the world. If any one wishes to know what such enjoyment is like let him have recourse to a great authority. \"_In the few hours of holiday that--only now and then--they (a nursing sisterhood) allow themselves, they show none of the weariness that sometimes follows the industry of toiling after self-amusement. Reaction, after great strain on the powers of self-sacrifice and endurance that they have to exert, may be thought to account in some part for the happy result; but, whatever the cause, their society has in it all that can best and most surely attract--grace, freshness, and natural charm._\"[1]  [Footnote 1: Kinglake in his _History of the Crimean War_, vol. vi. p. 436.]  Rose felt as if she had never sufficiently appreciated Annie before. She was very proud of her sister now when she came to Welby Square, and everybody, whether in Mrs. Jennings's set or in Hester's, was struck with Annie's beauty and brightness.  Even Hester Jennings saw nothing to find fault with on the ornamental side of a girl who had gone in so heartily for the serious business of life, nine-tenths of whose hours were occupied with grave tasks, to which Hester owned honestly that she with all her public spirit was not equal.  Annie's face was not only the most unclouded, her laugh the merriest of all the faces and laughs which appeared and were heard in Welby Square. She became almost as much of a peacemaker, a smoother-down of rough interludes, an allayer of irritating ebullitions, as Dora was wont to be at home.  \"Annie is so much improved,\" Rose wrote to May, \"I never saw her looking prettier. She is just splendid when she comes out of St. Ebbe's for an afternoon and evening. Everybody is delighted to see her, and wants to have her for his or her particular friend. She and I have such jolly walks and talks; she hardly ever calls me back or puts me down now.\"  After pronouncing this high encomium it was rather a shock to Rose not only to incur Annie's righteous displeasure, but to discover that on occasions Annie could be as severe and relentless in her sentences as ever.  Rose, like most middle-class girls not fairly out of their teens, and committed to their own discretion in the huge motley world of London, had been solemnly charged to behave with the greatest wariness. She was to treat every man or woman she encountered well-nigh as a dangerous enemy in disguise till her suspicions were proved to be misplaced, and the stranger shown to Rose's satisfaction and that of her seniors and guardians to be a harmless friend.  To do Rose justice, she remembered for the most part what had been told her, and was careful not to expose herself to the slightest chance of misapprehension--not to say rudeness, such as would have frightened her mother and incensed her father. Rose would not be tempted by the fearless independence of Hester Jennings and her cronies. They maintained, in theory at least, that though there might be dens of vice and dark places of cruelty in the great city, for those whose feet trod the downward path, yet its crowded thoroughfares, to those who honestly went about their own business, or to the messengers of divine charity and mercy, were as safe, and safer, than any quiet country road. Womanhood in the strength and confidence of its purity and fearlessness might traverse them alone at any hour of the day or night.  But Rose submitted to the ordinary if antiquated code, which implies the timidity and defencelessness of young women whenever and wherever assailed. She had not gone far enough in her emancipation to reckon as part of it, immunity from apprehension of every kind, including the strife of evil tongues.  However, one day in the beginning of May, Rose went to Covent Garden in pursuit of a pot of tulips, which she suddenly felt she must have, without delay, as an accessory in one of her sketches. She was coming home laden with her spoil by way of Burnet's, where there was an equal necessity for her to procure, on the instant, a yard or two of gauzy stuff of a certain uncertain hue, when a thunder-storm unexpectedly broke over the haunt of artists. Torrents of rain followed, enough to wash away whole pyramids of flowers and piles of art-materials. If the downpour did nothing else it cleared the crowded street, with the celerity of magic only seen in such circumstances, and left Rose cowering in a doorway, alone as it seemed to her, but for a cab-driver who took refuge in his cab, drawn up before one of the opposite houses. The rain looked as if it meant to continue, while, laden as Rose was, she could not have held up an umbrella even if she had found one ready to her hand.  Her slender funds did not set her up in cabs, as she had told herself on many a weary trudge in fog and drizzle between Mr. Foy's class-rooms and Welby Square. Besides she would like to see Hester Jennings's face when she (Rose Millar) proposed to indulge in such a luxury. But there would be more lost than gained if she stood shivering in that doorway till her best spring frock was ruined, waiting for an omnibus which was sure to arrive with every available inch of space occupied. She would catch a chill or an influenza with no kind father near to save her a doctor's bill, and cure her simply for the pleasure of doing it. She would brave Hester's eagle eye, supposing it could scan Rose's misdeeds from some coigne of vantage commanding this end of the street. She signalled to the cab-driver opposite, who put his head out of the cab window and signalled back that he had a fare besides himself at present ensconced in one of the inhospitable-looking houses.  Should she bid the thunder, lightning, and rain do their worst, and set out to walk home in defiance of them? While she still paused irresolute, peeping out disconsolately at the inky sky from which the downpour fell, a young man in the conscious superiority of a waterproof and an ample umbrella, walked leisurely along the sloppy, deserted pavement. He looked at her, seemed arrested by something which struck him in her appearance, hesitated a little undecidedly, stopped short, and addressed her, colouring up to his frank, honest blue eyes as he did so.  \"I am afraid you have been caught in this tremendous shower. Can I do nothing to help you--call a cab, for instance?\"  \"Oh! thank you very much,\" she said gratefully, forgetting all about the cunning enemy in disguise for whom she was to be always looking out. Indeed she had felt so lonely a minute before that she was rather disposed to welcome a comrade in misfortune. \"The cabman in the cab opposite tells me he is engaged, and I do not remember any cab-stand near this.\"  \"There is one round the corner, which I passed a minute ago, but it was vacant; all the world is wanting cabs in such weather. However, I can shelter you a little, if you will allow me,\" and he held the umbrella in front of her.  \"No, please; I am keeping you here in the wet, and you are exposing yourself to the rain,\" protested Rose, remorsefully. \"I was just thinking of walking on, sooner than stand any longer getting gradually soaked,\" she confided to him with pleasant inconsiderateness.  \"Then will you take the use of my umbrella?\" he asked promptly; \"and perhaps you will let me carry your parcels for you,\" he suggested in the humblest manner possible, eyeing covetously her flower-pot, and the paper wisp from \"Burnet's.\"  \"Oh dear, no,\" said Rose, pulling herself together when it was too late, and with an adorable frankness, which was another mistake so far as an unauthorized acquaintance's being nipped in the bud went. \"I should be taking you out of your way; you must want your own umbrella, and I can manage perfectly well. I am accustomed to go about by myself\"--the last piece of information given with a proud inflection of the voice which told its own tale.  \"In storm and shine?\" he took it upon him to question her, with the slightest rallying tone, and a twinkle in his blue eyes, but still with the greatest respect in his attitude and manner--\"not in storm, surely. I shall not be going out of my way. I am only taking a stroll--that is, I generally do take a stroll in some direction on my way back to my lodgings. You may not think the weather nice for strolling, but I don't mind it. I am as strong as a horse, and I certainly don't want an umbrella. I have this waterproof affair, which, like the umbrella, is rather a nuisance than otherwise.\"  She could see at a glance that he was a broad-shouldered young fellow, over six feet, and that his kindly, deferential face, seen through the steaming atmosphere, was as ruddy as youth and a vigorous constitution could make it. He was evidently speaking the truth, and she could not resist the temptation of the friendly aid arriving thus opportunely, and so obligingly pressed upon her.  \"Only for a little way,\" she bargained cheerfully. \"The rain may stop in a minute, though I must say it does not look like it, or we may come on a return cab; anyhow, it cannot be long till an omnibus overtakes us.\"  She would have demurred at his ridding her of her flowers and parcel, which he disposed of easily under his arm and in his disengaged hand, as if he were well accustomed to being cumbered with such small impediments, had not a comical idea crossed her mind. He might think that she did not trust his honesty, and was beset by a fear that he would rush down a side street and disappear with her goods before she could cry, \"Stop, thief!\" and arouse the scanty passers-by.  Then Rose felt impelled to explain why she walked about London burdened with flower-pots and rolls of gauze. \"I have just been to Covent Garden,\" she said. \"I wished to get this pot of tulips--parrot tulips--yellow and scarlet, you know, to harmonize with a Chinese screen in a little picture I am painting. Then I had to go into 'Burnet's,' for 'Liberty's' is too far away, for some blue stuff of the right shade which I could drape into a frock for the little girl who is my model.\"  \"Are you fond of painting?\" he caught her up, being to the full as willing to speak as she was. \"So is my sister, and she also goes to 'Liberty's' for queer rags and tags. I suppose they are part of the amateur's stock-in-trade.\"  \"I am going to be a professional artist,\" said Rose again, with that proud little inflection of the voice. But all the effect which her communication had upon him was that he took it as an invitation, or at least as a warrant, for responsive confidences on his own part.  \"I am a doctor,\" he announced. \"I have been entitled to write myself one for the last two months. I have just passed my final exams, and got my degree--stiffish work for a fellow who does not take to sapping as easily as to the air he breathes.\"  \"My father is a doctor,\" said Rose, brightly, with her tongue fairly loosened. \"I forget whether he says examinations were easier or more difficult when he was young. He is Dr. Millar of Redcross.\"  \"Millar!\" exclaimed the tall young man so excitedly, that he stopped short for an instant, in the middle of the dismally lashing rain, and looked at her with a gleam of delight in his blue eyes. \"I thought so, I saw it at the first glance. You have a sister among the lady probationers at St. Ebbe's.\"  \"Yes--Annie,\" cried Rose, with equal ecstasy in the acquiescence; and she, too, stood still for a second in the rain. \"Do you know St. Ebbe's? Have you seen Annie?\"  \"I should think I do, I should think I have,\" he answered her fervently. \"St. Ebbe's is my hospital. I have been 'walking it' for a year past. I was there to-day, and Miss Millar is well known all over the place. She is a great favourite with the matron, Mrs. Hull, and the house surgeon, and especially with the operating surgeon. He is always asking to have Miss Millar in his cases since that boy had his leg cut off.\"  \"I know, I know,\" chimed in Rose, \"the little boy who begged you to wait till he had said his prayers, and when he could not do it for himself, Annie was able to do it for him. Now he is hopping about on his crutches quite actively and happily; and she has got him an engagement, to clean the knives and boots at Mrs. Jennings, the boarding-house in Welby Square where I stay. Isn't it too funny and nice that you should happen to have to do with St. Ebbe's and Annie?\"  \"It has been a great pleasure to me--well, these are not the right words,\" said the young fellow with sudden gravity and a shade of agitation in his manner. \"I count it the greatest piece of good fortune which ever befell me that I took St. Ebbe's for my hospital. But I ought not to presume on my acquaintance with Miss Millar,\" he began again immediately, with an infusion of cautious reserve and something like vexation creeping into his tone; \"it is purely professional. We are far too busy people at St. Ebbe's to know each other as private persons. Very likely if you ask her, she will deny all knowledge of me as an individual; she may not even be able to recall the fact of my existence apart from a circle of big uncouth medical students in the train of the doctors--all alike to her. At the same time I have drunk tea in her company both in the matron's room and in Dr. Moss's, and I have often sat near her in the services at the hospital chapel,\" he ended a little defiantly.  The speech, save for its ring of half-boyish mortification, was suspicious, as if he were providing a loophole for escape in case Annie refused to indorse his assertion of mutual acquaintance. But Rose, in spite of her spirit and quickness, was hardly more given to suspicion than her sister May showed herself, and saw nothing dubious in his remark. She was carried away with the agreeable surprise of having stumbled on somebody connected with St. Ebbe's who knew all about Annie. She chatted on in the frankest, friendliest way, plying him with girlish questions, and supplying free comments on his answers; and he was an auditor who was nothing loth to be so treated, and to be furnished with stores of information on points which had aroused his ardent curiosity. She forgot all about taking him out of his way, and when they reached Welby Square she crowned her unbounded faith in him by inviting him into the house. On his acceptance of her invitation, after a moment's hesitation, she presented him to Mrs. Jennings as a friend of Annie's from St. Ebbe's.  The young man had the grace to feel his ears tingle while Mrs. Jennings, looking a little astonished, took him on Rose's word, bowed her welcome, begged him to sit down with her usual gracious, languid good-breeding, and said she was glad to see any friend of Miss Annie Millar's.  He did his best, with a flushed face, to remedy his and Rose's rashness. He put down his card, with Harry Ironside, M.D., engraved on it, at Mrs. Jennings's elbow. He set himself with a strenuous and sincere effort to talk to her, and so to conduct himself as to do credit to Rose's voucher.  Mrs. Jennings was easily propitiated on receiving the attention which was due to her. She thought the young man's manners perfectly good; they had well-bred ease, and at the same time the modesty which ought to accompany youth, though his introduction to her had been somewhat informal.  Irregularity and singularity were among the fashions of the day. She would have been glad if her daughter Hester, in carrying out these fashions, had brought forward no rougher, or commoner-looking, or more eccentric satellites and protgs--secretaries of those horrid women's unions and clubs--than this friend of Rose and Annie Millar's.  Mrs. Jennings never forgot a name and its social connection. \"Ironside?\" she repeated tentatively, but with an air of agreeable expectation. \"I am familiar with the name. One of my sons, Captain Lawrence Jennings, when his regiment was at Manchester, knew and received much kindness from a family named Ironside.\"  \"It must have been the family of one of my uncles,\" said Dr. Harry Ironside, eagerly. \"My Uncle John, and my Uncle Charles too, for that matter, stay in Manchester. Both are married men with families. My Uncle John was mayor a few years ago.\"  \"The same,\" cried Mrs. Jennings with bland satisfaction. \"Lawrie's Ironsides were the family of the mayor, I remember perfectly when you mention it;\" and she added the mental note, \"They were among the richest cotton-brokers in the place--well-nigh millionaires.\"  \"Were you all named from Cromwell's Ironsides?\" inquired Rose, lightly, inclined to laugh and colour at the absurd recollection that, though she had seemed to know all about him from the moment he spoke of St. Ebbe's and Annie, she had been ignorant of his very name till he put down his card. If he had not done so, she would have had to describe him to Annie as the big, fair-haired young doctor with the Roman nose, or by some other nonsensical item, such as the signet-ring on his left hand, or the trick of putting his hand to his chin.  \"I am sure I cannot tell\"--he met her question with an answering laugh--\"except that, so far as I know, we have had more to do with cotton than with cannon-balls. My father was a Manchester man, like my uncles. I have struck out a new line in handling--not to say a sword, but a lancet.\"  \"Ah!\" said Mrs. Jennings with mild superiority, \"all my sons are in the services--I have given them to their Queen and country. Two of my sons-in-law are also in the army, and I often say of the third--a clergyman in a sadly heathen part of the Black Country--that, engaged as he is in the Church militant, he is as much a fighter as the rest of them.\" Having thus in the mildest, most ladylike manner, established her social supremacy, Mrs. Jennings was doubly gracious to the visitor. They made such progress in their acquaintance by means of the Manchester Ironsides and other members of her very large circle of friends, with regard to whom the two discovered the names at least of several were also known to Harry Ironside, that the lady made another marked concession. When he said he was in rooms in London, and had his only sister with him, she signified with a kind and graceful bend of the lace-enfolded shoulders and the bewigged head within the wonderful edifice of a cap, that she meant to have the pleasure of calling on Miss Ironside.  Rose could hardly believe her ears; and she did not wonder, though she was glad that he had the sense and good feeling to thank Mrs. Jennings with warmth, since Rose knew what a testimony it was to the genuine liking which the mistress of the house had taken to her chance guest. For Mrs. Jennings went very little out, and was exceedingly particular in adding to her visiting-list, as became the head of a select boarding-house, and the mother of so many officers and gentlemen, not to say gentlewomen.  But matters did not end even there. He managed to convey the impression that his sister and he were rather lonely in their rooms, while he alluded to the facts that he and she were orphans, and with the exception of each other had neither brother nor sister. They had looked forward to being together, and making a home as soon as Kate left school, and he had taken furnished lodgings at Campden Hill till he settled down somewhere. But somehow the lodgings were not very home-like. He should prize highly the friendship of Mrs. Jennings for his sister. At this point the slightest gleam of a business interest awoke in Mrs. Jennings's steel gray eyes, though she only told him softly that she had known it all--the loneliness of one or two members of a family in London, the comfortlessness of even the best of furnished apartments. It was such considerations, in a great measure, which had induced her to utilize her large house, much too large for herself and the only daughter left at home with her, to receive a few old friends as suitable boarders into her family. She had hoped to form a cheerful and refined little society round her, and so to be of a little use to her fellow-creatures. She might say she had succeeded in her humble mission, she finished with artless benevolence. He met her half-way with breathless alacrity. Had he and Kate but known in time Mrs. Jennings's generous idea, what a boon it would have been if she had let them avail themselves of it! Even yet if there ever occurred any change, any opening--but he was afraid, he added in disconsolate tones, there never would--the fortunate people would know too well when they were happy--it would be doing him and Kate the greatest favour, the utmost kindness to let them know. This was exactly the complimentary, beseeching, deprecatory mode in which Mrs. Jennings liked business to be conducted; whereas, if Hester had been present, she would have said in the clumsiest, coarsest manner, \"Mamma, there are some rooms vacant, which any respectable person who cares to pay the rent may have.\"  But that was not Mrs. Jennings's plan. She said in her blandest voice--\"Well, Dr. Ironside, we must see what we can do for you and your sister; I cannot bear to think of your feeling forlorn after what your cousins did for my son Lawrence. We must stretch a point with regard to accommodating you--that is, if you are not, both of you, dreadfully particular. No, you are not at all difficult to put up, you and your sister, you say? I am happy to hear it. It is such a good thing for young people to be easily pleased. I am not sure that something could not be contrived in the course of a week or two. I think I heard my old servant speak of rooms which were to have been kept for cousins of my friend Mr. Lyle, two charming ladies who were to have come up from the country for the season. But their dear old aunt died unexpectedly, and of course they are not inclined for any gaiety at present. I leave the details of arranging the sets of rooms and letting them to my Susan. I never interfere with her; she knows far better than I what is wanted, and she is a sensible, practical person to deal with. If you care to speak to Susan, I shall ring for her to see you in the dining-room, and she will tell you at once what she can do for you,\" Mrs. Jennings finished sweetly.  He did care; indeed he was so intent on benefiting by what Mrs. Jennings, in her ladylike way, made so great an obligation conferred by her on her fellow-creatures, that he caught at the hope held out to him. He had an interview with the potent Susan, and came back radiant to tell that the housekeeper had been nearly as kind to him as her mistress had shown herself. He and Susan had settled everything. He was free to give up the rooms which he and his sister were occupying the following week.  \"What, without consulting Miss Ironside?\" protested Mrs. Jennings in pretty alarm.  \"Oh! Kate will like any arrangement I make,\" he cried confidently; and Rose came to the conclusion either that \"Kate\" was the simple school-girl he represented her, or that Dr. Harry Ironside was an autocrat in his domestic relations.  He insisted on furnishing references, because business was business, even in the light of the dawning friendship which he trusted Mrs. Jennings was going to extend to him and Kate, and they would come as soon as she would let them.  Oh! he must arrange it all with Susan. Mrs. Jennings put up her still dainty hands, and waived him off playfully. She dared not interfere with Susan. All she would say was that she was delighted to look forward to such an agreeable addition to her pleasant little circle. She was fond of having young people about her, and was always ready to do what she could (which was no more than the truth) to make them happy.  Rose was driven to the conclusion that Dr. Harry Ironside must have found furnished lodgings such a pandemonium, that he was induced to believe a select boarding-house must be a paradise by comparison. It was comical how it had all come about. It did seem as if Rose's heedlessness, if she had been heedless in drifting without an introduction into an acquaintance with one of Annie's doctors, was likely to bear good fruits to Mrs. Jennings, among other people. Hester had been looking worried lately, and had not scrupled to give as the reason of her pre-occupation--family affairs not prosperous. The whole of the house was not let. Old Mr. and Mrs. Foljambe had actually been unreasonable enough to try to exchange the best rooms, which they had chosen for themselves in the winter for shabbier, cheaper quarters during the summer, when the husband and wife might be occasionally absent paying visits. Old Susan, in her black cap and gold-rimmed spectacles, was especially triumphant in seeing the scheme balked, and confided her mingled exultation and indignation to Rose, who had helped to balk the schemers. The confidential family servant even forgot some of her polite mannerliness in her excitement. \"Now, Miss Millar, them Foljambes has done for themselves; serve them right for seeking to get a catch from a friend like Missus, as is that kind to her boarders, which you can testify, Miss; they might be her own flesh and blood. Bless you! she'll never make a rap by keeping boarders. She never grudges them anythink, and would sooner deny herself than that they should go without their fancies. But there, now, that fine young gentleman you brought,\" went on Susan with the slightest respectful significance, \"I'm sure we're greatly indebted to you, Miss--speaks as if he meant to stay on here with his sister for the present. He has taken our largest rooms off our hands, so that we may be easy on that head, and I for one won't be sorry if Mr. and Mrs. Foljambe ain't able to shift back into them at their will and pleasure. The young gent, as is a gent, had no hargle-bargling about terms. He was satisfied to pay what we asked, because he knew that though it was not a common boarding-house, and though it was no more than right that he and his sister should pay for the privilege of being under the roof of a real lady like Missus, we were not the sort to ask more than our due.\"  The moment Rose got quit of Susan, she said to herself complacently, \"It is very nice to have done such a service to Mrs. Jennings and Hester and everybody, instead of having got into a scrape and being scolded, as I almost feared at one moment. If only Miss Kate Ironside is not too much of a dumb belle and a mere school-girl,\" reflected Rose, with the supercilious consciousness of maturity in a girl who had been more than a year away from all teaching except what she had herself practised, and what she received as a grown-up woman at Mr. St. Foy's. \"I wonder if Dr. Harry Ironside will have spoken of our encounter, and what came of it, to Annie before I can tell her. I should like to see her face when she learns that I know somebody who goes to St. Ebbe's,\" ended Rose, with persistent audacity.  Annie's face was a study when she heard of it. Rose had been guilty of a little wilful self-deception, still she received a shock.  The first time the sisters were able to meet and have a walk together, after Rose's encounter with Dr. Ironside, Rose broached the great piece of news, and witnessed the effect it produced. The girls had managed to reach the Marble Arch into Hyde Park, beyond which they found a seat for a few minutes. It was not too early in the season for them to take possession of it, and they were still sufficiently strangers in London to suppose that seats were placed for the accommodation of the weary of all ranks and both sexes, and not merely for the benefit of nurse-maids and their charges, or of able-bodied tramps. The sisters prepared to talk over their own concerns and Redcross with the _empressement_ of girls, to forget all about the moving crowd around them, and the grinding of that great mill of London in the traffic that is never for an instant still.  \"Oh! Annie, have you seen him lately?\" began Rose--\"Dr. Harry Ironside, I mean. Has he told you that he and his sister are coming to board at Mrs. Jennings's?\"  \"Seen him! Dr. Harry Ironside! What do you know about Dr. Harry Ironside? What are you saying, Rose?\" cried Annie, sitting bolt upright, opening wide her dark eyes, and fixing them in the most amazed, displeased, discomfiting gaze on Rose. The rate at which the two had been walking and talking, the suspicion of east wind, the premature heat of the May sun, had converted the soft red in Annie's cheeks to a brilliant scarlet.  \"What I am saying,\" answered Rose, nodding gaily, and trying hard not to flinch under the trying reception of her precious piece of information, \"is that, by the funniest chance, I made the acquaintance of a friend of yours at St. Ebbe's. And the laughable coincidence of our meeting and happening to speak to each other, and then of my finding out that he knew all about you, is going to be a very good thing for poor dear Mrs. Jennings,\" Rose hastened to add, taking the first word in self-defence. \"He is coming with his sister to board in Welby Square.\"  \"He is not a friend of mine,\" said Annie, severely. \"Is it possible that you are such a simpleton as to believe that all the doctors, medical students, and nurses--the whole staff of St. Ebbe's, in fact, are intimately acquainted with each other, are acquainted at all, for the most part, unless as doctors and nurses? Please, Rose, tell me at once what nonsense this is--what foolish thing you have been about.\"  When Annie said \"please\" to her sisters the situation was alarming.  On the other hand, Rose had not come up to London to be an artist, who was already getting orders for scroll-work and executing them successfully, to be put down by a sister not above four years her senior.  \"What are you making such a fuss about, Annie?\" protested Rose, \"I am telling you as fast as you will let me. I came out this morning for the express purpose, and I thought--I was almost sure--you would be amused and interested, instead of 'getting into a wax'\"--using one of Hester Jennings's slang words, which set Annie's fine little teeth on edge. \"It is you who ought to explain and apologize to me,\" proceeded Rose, boldly; \"I am surely at liberty to make the acquaintance of anybody you know without your looking annoyed, and accusing me of being foolish and nonsensical. It is very unjust and ungrateful of you besides, for he spoke very highly of you,\" Rose finished innocently.  \"He spoke highly of me to my own sister!\" repeated Annie, her lips curling with unutterable disdain, and her cheeks in a wilder flame than ever. \"He had nothing to do speaking of me at all. And how did he come to speak to you? I insist upon your telling me, Rose. I am older than you, and we are alone in London. I am answerable for you to father and mother.\"  \"Well, I always thought I was answerable for myself,\" said Rose, indignantly. \"But I don't want to conceal anything from you; it is insulting me to suppose so,\" and Rose showed herself highly resentful in her turn. \"As to how I met and spoke with Dr. Harry Ironside, I was just coming to that,\" she was going on deliberately, when she was stopped by Annie's irritable protest--  \"I wish you would not bring forward that man's name and dwell upon it in the way you are doing.\"  \"Why, Annie, what ails you?\" cried Rose in her bewilderment at Annie's unreasonableness and excitement, forgetting any verdict that might be passed on her own neglect of the code of conduct imposed upon her.  \"Well, if you only knew how I have been tried--and molested--and laughed at,\" Annie began wrathfully, saying the last words as if to be laughed at was equivalent to being burnt alive. Then she stopped short and turned again upon Rose. \"What have you been doing? tell me this instant, Rose.\"  \"I don't think you ought to speak to me in this manner,\" said Rose, rebelliously, holding her head high in the air, and forgetting in her soreness of spirit either to crumple her nose or wrinkle her forehead; \"and I am not at all ashamed of myself. I have done nothing wrong; indeed, I believe I have conferred a real benefit on Mrs. Jennings, though she is apt to put it the other way, and indirectly on Hester. I _am_ fond of Mrs. Jennings and Hester--_they_ always treat me, even Hester does, like a rational creature. Oh! you need not fret and fume--I am not trying to avoid telling you, though you have no right, no sister has, to demand an account of my proceedings. Father and mother may have, but they would never brandish their rights in my face or refuse to trust me. I was coming home from Covent Garden on Saturday afternoon, carrying a little pot of tulips for my picture, if you must know, and I had also got a small parcel from 'Burnet's.' I was caught in the thunder-storm. I was standing in a doorway not knowing what to do when a gentleman passed--Dr. Harry Ironside, if I am to be allowed to say his name, though I did not know it then. He was good-natured and polite, like any other gentleman. He saw how I was encumbered, and he must have felt the pelting rain. He stopped and asked if he could do anything for me--call a cab or anything, and he wished to give me the use of his umbrella till we reached a cab-stand or till an omnibus came up. I thought I had better tell him why I was carrying things, for he might have thought me just a shop-girl, so I merely said I required them for a painting, and that I was learning to be an artist. He seemed to think he ought to tell me in return what he was, and he said he was a doctor. Then I said father was a doctor too, Dr. Millar of Redcross. He cried out at that something about a likeness which he had seen, and he asked had I a sister a nurse in St. Ebbe's, and oh! Annie, he looked so pleased, and he did say you were such a favourite with the matron and the doctors.\"  \"Stop!\" cried Annie, peremptorily, with an evident storm raging in her gentle breast, to which she was too proud and self-restrained to give free expression, \"you are a greater baby than May is. You are not fit to be left to yourself--a girl who would speak to any man she might meet in the streets of London, and tell him all about herself and her family.\"  The accusation was too outrageous to be received with anything save indignant silence.  \"And then, I suppose, the next thing was you took him to Mrs. Jennings and arranged between you that he and his sister should board there.\"  \"I did not,\" Rose was goaded to speak. \"When he had walked so far with me in the rain I could not do less than invite him into the house. Then I believe he gave his name, and Mrs. Jennings, who has a great deal of knowledge of the world and a great deal of discrimination,\" put in poor Rose with much emphasis, \"seemed to like him immensely. She found that one of her sons knew relations of his in Manchester, and they had other friends in common. He spoke of his sister, who is with him, and of their not liking living in lodgings, and who glad he would be if there ever happened to be a vacancy in Mrs. Jennings's establishment which she would permit them to fill. She referred him to Susan to see if there were rooms which the Ironsides could have. It all came about quite naturally, and was settled in less time than I have taken to tell it, and I had nothing whatever to do with it. I should not dream of taking it upon me to interfere with Mrs. Jennings's or anybody else's domestic affairs.\"  \"I do not know,\" said Annie, gloomily, \"after the mess you have got yourself and other people into. But there is one thing I can tell you for your satisfaction, I shall not put my foot within Mrs. Jennings's door so long as he--as Dr. Ironside and his sister are staying there. You may keep your friends to yourself and do without your sister. You can take them instead of me; perhaps you will not miss me or care for the loss of an occasional hour or two of my society.\"  \"Oh! Annie, how can you say so?\" Rose was reduced to expostulation and pleading. \"What has come over you? You must not stay away; it would be so unkind to me, so rude to everybody, and such a marked slight. We are all so happy when you come to Welby Square, and I am sure the change is good for you too. How can you be so cross?\"  \"No,\" said Annie with unbending decision, \"it shall not be said of me that I went and struck up a friendship, apart from our intercourse in the wards, with any doctor at St. Ebbe's--one of the medical students, the other day! I am not going to make his sister's acquaintance and get up an intimacy with her, because you have chosen to introduce them to Mrs. Jennings. A fine story to be circulated, and tittered over, about a girl; a fine example to the working nurses, who are always seeking to evade the rules, to become on familiar terms with their patients and to gossip and philander with them, when they ought to have a great deal more to do. I call it disgusting trifling, and it was not for that I came up to London to be trained as a nurse.\"  Annie kept her word to Rose's and other people's deep chagrin. She made no further ferment about what had happened. She did not write home and complain of Rose's thoughtlessness, or take a single step to prevent Mrs. Jennings securing a profitable pair of boarders--as a matter of fact, she dropped the subject, perhaps she felt a little ashamed of the animus she had shown. But for nearly three months, if Rose wished to see her sister, the only plan was for her to go to St. Ebbe's, or to make an appointment with Annie at the Academy or the British Museum, or to eat their lunch together at some convenient restaurant.  In whatever manner Annie disposed of her few spare moments, not one of them was now spent in Welby Square--just at the time, too, when the boarding-house was particularly social and cheerful (for the new-comers found special favour with the old, and promoted much good fellowship). At least Dr. Harry Ironside did. He was a young fellow born to be popular whether he would or not; handsome, with pleasant manners, kind-hearted, possessed of a respectable competence independent of his profession, to which he brought considerable abilities and great singleness of purpose. Everybody \"took\" to him, from crusty Mr. Foljambe to jaunty Mr. Lyle; from Miss Perkins, whose ear-trumpet he improved upon, to old Susan, into whose gold-rimmed spectacles he put new glasses which made her see like a girl again. The one drawback to his success in everything he aimed at was, that he was always tremendously in earnest, so that his very earnestness overweighted him, rendering him incapable of measuring obstacles, and marshalling his forces, as a more indifferent man might have done.  His sister Kate, apart from such importance as might be implied in her finding herself presently in the enjoyment of a very pretty little income for a young lady, was a simple, good-natured school-girl, in the echoing and imitative stage of school-girl life. She looked up to her brother in everything, and was disposed to regard whatever was by his decree as infallibly best.  Yes, Annie kept her word after the fashion of most of us, till she saw good reason to break it. She announced herself changeless till she changed, which, to do her justice, was when the interests of others, still more than her own, cried out against her maintaining her resolution.     CHAPTER XVII.  MAY HAS TO FIGHT HER OWN BATTLE.   All May's frantic efforts at resistance were useless; her destiny was too strong for her. She had to go away from her mother and father, Dora, and Tray, and face life all by herself as one of the girl-graduates at Thirlwall Hall, St. Ambrose's. Dr. Millar had learnt that she would just be in reasonable time for one of the earlier examinations at the close of the term. Having passed it without difficulty, she might compete for one of the Thirlwall scholarships. If she got that--as he allowed himself to think she had a fair chance of doing--it would greatly increase her status, as well as aid in defraying the expenses of her residence at St. Ambrose's. The little Doctor was feverishly anxious to compass both ends for his pet and scholar. In her own interest no notice must be taken of her heart-broken looks, though it wrung a manly heart, in addition to the tender hearts of Mrs. Millar and Dora, to witness May's desperate unwillingness to depart.  It will be better to throw a veil over the anguish of that leave-taking, including the final closeting with Tray and the torrents of tears shed on his irresponsive hairy coat. We shall draw up the curtain on a new scene--St. Ambrose's, in its classic glory and stately beauty, and Thirlwall Hall, in its youthful strong-mindedness.  Poor May felt horribly forlorn when her father left her behind, and she realized that she was for the first time in her life compelled to play her part without the support of kith or kin. Nobody was in the least unkind to her, any more than the conservative Miss Stones had been to Rose, unless in calling \"little May\" \"Miss Millar,\" a promotion which somehow cut her to the heart.  The lady principal, Miss Lascelles, was an excellent intellectual woman, of mingled aristocratic and _spirituelle_ antecedents. In another country and nation she might have been a distinguished _dame de salon_. As it was, she was sufficiently harassed and overworked in her double office of decorous, authoritative chaperon and qualified guide, philosopher, and friend to the girls under her charge. These might be vestal virgins or nymphs of Minerva, but they were also girls, so long as the world lasted--the most of them half curious, half friendly where May was concerned. This was true even of the wonderful young American who came and stayed with no other object in view than to say she had kept her terms at St. Ambrose's, according to what was the sum total of the ambition of many a young man at the great University. She _would_ call the Atlantic \"the herring pond,\" and speak of \"fixing\" her hair; still she was a girl like the rest of them. Miss Lascelles, with all the other ladies in residence at Thirlwall Hall, the American included, could not help wondering what the friends and guardians of a budding beauty and helpless baby like Miss Millar intended by sending her to live among a set of self-reliant, amply-occupied young women, who, as a rule, knew exactly what they wanted to do and did it.  The whole place and system overwhelmed May. The hoary dignity of the old colleges, receptacles of the concentrated learning of ages, the crowds of capped and gowned tutors and professors, potent representatives of the learning of the present, even the shoals of young men who were able to care for none of these things, and to carry their responsibilities lightly, all to be encountered in the course of a morning walk, struck May with a sense of inadjustable disproportion, and of intolerable presumption on her part in pretending to be a scholar. She was still one of a household largely composed of women, as she had been at home, but here the household was planted where it was an innovation, in the midst of a colony of men, which constantly threatened to sweep over it and submerge it.  The grown-up, independent, yet disciplined routine of Thirlwall Hall, founded as closely as possible on the venerable routine of the men's colleges, was widely, crushingly different from life in the Old Doctor's House at Redcross. Morning chapel, the steady business of individual reading, the attendance on the selected courses of lectures, with the new experience of being spoken to, and expected to take notes like men; the walks and talks, which even with the interruptions of tennis and boating were apt to be academically shoppy; the very afternoon tea after evening chapel had an impressively scholastic flavour utterly foreign to the desultory proceedings of an ordinary family circle. So had the further reading by one's self, for one's self, to get up a particular branch of study; the \"swell dinner,\" as May persisted in calling it in her own mind, though it was simple and social enough--beyond certain indispensable forms and ceremonies--to the initiated; the withdrawal once more to the dreary retirement of her own room, since a new girl had neither the requisite familiarity nor the heart to go and tap at her neighbours' doors, where no substitute for \"sporting the oak\" had as yet been found, and drop in for a little purely human chatter.  May was so \"hard hit,\" as people say--not with love, but with home-sickness--that she did not believe she could live to the end of the summer term. She felt as if she must die of strangeness, fright, and pining; and that was hard, for they would be very sorry at home, and so would Annie and Rose in London, though both of them had been able to go and stay away quite cheerfully like the girls at Thirlwall Hall. Perhaps May and Dora were not like other girls. There was something wanting or something in excess about them. Perhaps they were not fit to go through the world, as she had once heard somebody say of her--May. Perhaps they were meant to die young--like their Aunt Dolly--and not destined to live long and struggle helplessly with adverse circumstances. In that case, Dora was the happy one to be left to spend her short life at home, though, save for father and mother, she too was all alone, and poor dear Dora would feel that, and was, perhaps, crying in another empty room as May was crying in hers at this very moment; but at least, Dora would pass her last days with father and mother in the old familiar places.  This isolated doom for herself and Dora fascinated May's imagination. She could not get it out of her head. She dreamt about it, and sat up in her bed crying and shivering in the silence and solitude of night, where even by day all was silent and solitary. She began to think that she would never see Redcross or her mother again. With the morbid sentimentality of early youth, and its lively capacity for self-torture, in which to be sure there is that underlying luxury of woe, she commenced to rehearse the loving farewells she would take on paper, and the harrowing last messages she would send to every member of her family.  Occasionally May's hallucination took the form of conjuring up a series of disasters which should suddenly descend on her absent friends. If she did not die herself, one or all of those she loved might die while she was separated from them. Her father might fall down in a fit; her mother might be seized with small-pox or typhoid fever; and what more likely than that Dora should catch the infection waiting on her mother?  This distempered frame of mind was hardly calculated for the rapid reception and assimilation of these particles, terminations, and cases of philological nicety in which May began to recognize that she was inaccurate and deficient.  If Tray could but have come to her, and laid his shining black nose in her lap, barked in her face, and invited her to take a turn in the grounds of Thirlwall Hall, he would have ceased to be the doleful, shadowy phantom of a Tray she was constantly seeing now, along with other phantoms. A game of romps with her four-footed friend would have done something to dissipate the mental sickness which was prostrating May's powers. But Thirlwall Hall was moulded on the men's colleges, and there were no dogs for the girl any more than for the boy graduates.  Miss Lascelles was at once conscientious and kind, with considerable natural sagacity; but she led a busy, rather over-burdened life, and had little time to spare. Naturally she was tempted, in spite of the logical faculty which made her a capital principal of Thirlwall Hall, to leap at conclusions like many of her weaker-minded sisters. She had taken it for granted that Miss Millar was simply a spoilt child, without more ability and information than had just served her to surmount the preliminary test of admission to Thirlwall Hall, where, nevertheless, she had no business to be. Her time would be completely wasted; she would only be wretched, and serve to make other people uncomfortable. However, as she had stood the preliminary test, and was at Thirlwall Hall for the rest of the term, the most humane thing to do was to set some other girl who was not particularly engaged on her own account, who could be safely trusted with such a charge, who had plenty of acquaintances at St. Ambrose's to render the charge lighter, to make friends with the poor girl, take her about, cheer and entertain her, as far as possible, till the end of her stay.  Miss Lascelles, in default of better, fixed on Miss Vanhansen, the American young lady, as a friend for May. Miss Vanhansen had plenty of time on her hands, plenty of confidence, plenty of money. She had taken even exclusive St. Ambrose's by storm, for Athens itself would have found it difficult to resist her racy indifference, her shrewd mother-wit, her superb frocks, and her sublime heaps of dollars. At the same time she was perfectly good-natured and quite trustworthy in her own free and easy way. She had scandalized Miss Lascelles in the earlier days of their acquaintance by her energetic determination to have \"a good time of it.\" She had made the lady principal's hair stand on end by calmly suggesting nice rides and rows and luncheons at village inns, _tte--tte_ with the \"mooniest\" young fellows who could be laid hold of and crammed with stories about America and the doings of American girls.  But practically Miss Vanhansen had the good sense to do at Rome as the Romans did; she confined her independence to those sallies of the tongue, which were not without a rousing charm in a place grown partly languid, partly esoteric, by dint of a superabundance of culture and of college statutes elaborate, involved and irreversible as the laws of the Medes and the Persians.  Keturah Vanhansen rather liked the task imposed upon her. It appealed at once to her kindliness of nature and her love of creating a sensation; she would rouse this drooping young beauty who showed such a sinful disregard of her complexion and eyes. Miss Vanhansen was herself as sallow as a nabob, her small eyes, by an unkind perversity on the part of her fairy god-mother, were of a fishy paleness, yet she managed to her great satisfaction, by dint of dress and carriage, to be a striking-looking and all but a handsome girl, so that she had no overpowering reason to be jealous of her better-endowed neighbours. She would astonish Miss Millar's weak nerves, and give her \"a wrinkle or two,\" before she had done with her.  At first May shrank back a good deal from the advances of the conquering princess from the Far West; but here the English girl's humility and good feeling stood her in better stead than her judgment. May was grateful to Miss Vanhansen, and went so far as to be flattered by her attentions even when they gave the recipient no pleasure. That frame of mind could not last at seventeen. May, the most unsophisticated and easily pleased of human beings, was won from her sad dreams of Redcross. She was deeply obliged, she was faintly amused. At last she was fairly launched on such a mild course of St. Ambrose gaieties as two girls in a college could with grace pursue. This included tennis parties, rowing parties, water-lily and fritillary hunts, \"strawberries,\" concerts instead of lectures in the afternoons as well as in the evenings, afternoon teas--not _tte--tte_, not confined to a party of three, but under what even Miss Lascelles would have considered sufficient surveillance in the rooms of liberal heads of houses, hospitable young dons, social, idle undergraduates. These had no more business on their hands than could be summed up in cricket-matches or boat-races, and in meeting Miss Vanhansen and listening to her queer unconventional remarks.  At all these gatherings, May Millar in the budding beauty of seventeen and the simplicity of her youthful dress, with her modesty and _navet_, was made very welcome. Soon she began to feel herself ashamed of the extent to which she was enjoying herself, as she was swept along by the stream.  She was able to write home now long letters full of girlish enthusiasm over the kindness of Miss Vanhansen, and the beauties and delights of St. Ambrose's. Dora, though greatly relieved in her ungrudging devotion to May, to find that Tom Robinson's words were fulfilled, was still a little puzzled to understand how May could find time for so many gay doings, and her studies into the bargain. But Dr. and Mrs. Millar could only be happy in the happiness of their child, and hug themselves on having thought more of her welfare than of her feelings at the moment of parting. It was right she should see all the charming sights which were to be seen, and enter a little into the special attractions of the great University town--_that_ would not prevent her from settling down and doing her proper work presently. You might trust the lady principal and a studious young creature like May, who liked to be busy with her books far before any other occupation, with a great deal more license than that came to.  Then a new turn was given to the dissipation in which May was dipping. The longing in which she had indulged, ever since she had first heard of its possible fulfilment, was granted--a Greek play was to be acted by the young women who stood for the \"Grecians\" of the year at Thirlwall Hall, and May was there to see. From the moment the play was decided upon to the hour of the first rehearsal, May spoke, thought, and dreamed of nothing save \"Alcestis.\"  Miss Vanhansen gave her up in disgust. \"The ungrateful, soft-spoken wretch!\" cried the forsaken fair one; \"the hypocritical young blue-grass Penelope Blue! she has been bluer than the blue clouds all the time she has been imposing on me as a pining, bread-and-butter, home-sick miss among us Titanesses and daughters of the gods. Here I am ready to collapse with trotting her about among the few girls in St. Ambrose's who are sensible enough not to know the Empire of the East from the Empire of the West, and would not care which was which if they did know, and the still wiser young men who spend the long summer days lying on their backs in their own canoes, reading Mark Twain. Oh! she is a brazen-faced impostor. 'Molasses!' and 'Great Scott!' are not enough to say to her. I should like to try her with the final polite remarks of the last chief of the Dogs' Noses.\"  But contemporaneously with May's being thus dropped by her first friend, she was peremptorily claimed and appropriated by the actresses. They had not failed to notice her interest in their enterprise, and some of the cleverest of them had already mastered an astonishing problem.  They had been guilty of nicknaming Miss Millar \"Baby,\" because she had been so lachrymose and shiftless when she came to Thirlwall Hall, and had never looked up till she was handed over to Miss Vanhansen, who had given her \"airings\" and \"outings\" all very well for a baby, and much to Baby's taste as it seemed, but not exactly severe study. Yet in spite of it all, and in spite of the halting inaccuracy of the training in a private ladies'-school, May Millar knew more by sheer instinct, as it sounded, of Alcestis, and felt more with her and for her, than the best of those who professed to be her interpreters.  It was therefore not with wisely repairing the breaches in her Latin and Greek, and laying these foundations afresh, as Rose was doing with her art under Mr. St. Foy in London, that May was engrossed. It was with becoming a bond-slave to those ambitious players. She lent herself to the minutest details of their attempt, coached herself in them day and night, till she could coach everybody in turn, and figured behind backs as universal prompter, dresser, stage-manager--the girl who had been so lifeless and incapable of looking after herself when she first came among them that they had styled her the baby of the establishment!  Miss Lascelles, who was deeply interested in the play, both in her highly-finished scholarship, and for the credit of Thirlwall Hall, was electrified when she discovered the efficient coadjutor whom the performers had found. \"I am afraid there has been a mistake made, and time lost,\" she said to herself ruefully. \"How could I be so shortsighted, when there is the making of the finest scholar in the Hall in Miss Millar, who threatened to hang so heavily on my hands that I was fain to send her to play with our generous 'Barbarian.' What discrimination, what taste and feeling with regard to the selection and fit declamation of these passages which we were doubtful whether to retain or reject, or what to do with them! With what pretty girlish shyness and timidity she made the suggestions! Nothing but her passionate love of the subject, and her jealousy for its honour, as it were, with her intense craving to have it fitly expressed, would have induced her to come forward. I should like to hear what Professor Hennessy,\" naming a great name among classical authorities, \"thinks of this young girl's interpretation of several parts of the play when he comes to hear them. I should like to introduce Miss Millar to him if she were not so frightened, and if she had taken the place which she ought to have held to begin with. It is too late to rectify the mistake and set her to work this term, and she had much better not go in for the Markham scholarship which her father spoke of--that would be worse than useless. But we'll turn over a new leaf next term. After all, she is very young; and I suppose it is of no great consequence that she has wasted her first half. Her family are professional people, and these are generally well off.\" (Miss Lascelles was the portionless daughter of the impecunious younger son of a poor nobleman.)  When the play was performed nearly all the classical scholars of St. Ambrose's--and what was a man doing at St. Ambrose's if he were not a classical scholar, unless, to be sure, he happened to be a philosopher of the first water, or a profound expounder of Anglo-Saxon, or a strangely and wonderfully informed pundit?--came with their wives and daughters, and graciously applauded the daring deed.  As for Keturah Vanhansen, she wore her _rivire_ of diamonds, dripping, dancing, flashing like water that was perpetually flowing, and yet, by some enchantment, arrested in its flow in glorious suspension. Set in the middle of the enchanted water was such a breast-knot of rare, exquisite, uncannily grotesque orchids as no queen or princess had ever been seen to wear in St. Ambrose's. Indeed, it might have suited the Queen of Sheba.  Miss Vanhansen announced that she wore her war-paint to do honour to the Thirlwall Hall play, and to May Millar, whom she had forgiven, for rancour never yet dwelt in the Yankee breast. \"Alcestis\" was a little long, and \"real right down funny,\" as her Aunt Sally would have said, though it was a tragedy, and she, Keturah Vanhansen, did not understand a word of it, notwithstanding this was her last year at Thirlwall Hall. One good joke was the man who was in cats' skins, and carried a kitchen poker for a club, and was half a head shorter than she was, and she was not big; they should see her Aunt Abe if they wanted to know what a big woman was like. Another joke was the sacks for the ladies' frocks, with holes for the head and feet, and holes for the arms, so nice and simple, and so graceful; Worth ought to get a hint of the costume. Only it was not very distinctive, when one regarded the corresponding sacks for the gentlemen. There was really nothing to mark out the ladies except the large towels which they wore hanging down their backs, while the gentlemen had Inverness capes over their sacks, fastened on the shoulders with Highland brooches. How came the Greeks, in the time of Euripides, to know about Inverness capes and Highland brooches? She, Keturah Vanhansen, had been so startled by what she feared might be a frightful anachronism that all her false hair had fallen off, and she had been left like one of her Aunt Abe's moulting fowls.  The truth was that, in the matter of hair, nature had favoured Miss Vanhansen with a peculiarly fine and luxuriant crop, so that she had no need to apply to art for its help.  But as for May, she saw nothing and heard nothing of the discrepancies which might mar the ancient story to far less ostentatiously matter-of-fact and mocking critics than the would-be barbarian from beyond the herring-pond. The piteous tragedy was enacted in all its terror and pathos to May. She forgot even to sigh for one of the original great open-air amphitheatres, with the cloudless blue sky of Greece overhead, which had been the fit setting to those old-world plays; while she appreciated, without being conscious of the appreciation, every scenic item--the double stage, the attendant chorus, the classic dress, that had awakened Miss Vanhansen's ridicule, from the sandal on the foot to the toque on the head--all which could lend verisimilitude to the spectacle. For the benefit of happy May, Alcestis lived again in modern St. Ambrose's. Once more she suffered and died willingly in the room of Admetus; once more the miserable husband's half-heroic, half-savage ally, Harakles, fought Death for his pale prey, and brought back the sacrificed wife from Hades, to restore her--a figure veiled and motionless, yet instinct with glad life, every vein throbbing with love and thankfulness--to the arms of her husband, more joyful, and at the same time, in the middle of his joy, more full of yearning sorrow and self-abasement than ever was happy bridegroom.  On the day after the play, Miss Lascelles casually mentioned to May that even if she went in for the coming examination, she, Miss Lascelles, thought May had better not try for the Markham scholarship.  \"But I must, Miss Lascelles,\" protested May, starting up as if she were awakening from a dream, and opening great eyes of distress and apprehension--feelings which were only at that moment called into life. \"My father would be so vexed and disappointed if I did not.\"  \"If you will take my advice, my dear, you will wait till next year; there will be another scholarship falling in then. Very many of the Thirlwall Hall girls do much better the second year than they have done the first,\" Miss Lascelles continued to warn her girl-graduate, with the delicate consideration and tact which qualified the lady principal for her office. \"It is bad policy to enter hastily into a competition with failure staring you in the face. It will only serve to dishearten you, and to mislead people with regard to what I am now certain--I can honestly congratulate you on my conviction--are your really exceptional gifts. You will do Thirlwall Hall credit, and we shall all be proud of you, if you will have patience. You are very young; you can afford to wait. It is a common occurrence for clever, studious girls, and lads too, to come up to St. Ambrose's from the country, from private schools or home-teaching, who are not sufficiently exact in their scholarship, and do nothing beyond remedying the defect in their first or even their second year. You don't grudge giving what is but a fraction of your life, after all, to thorough as opposed to superficial learning, do you, dear? Remember, the one is worthy and the other worthless--a mere pretentious waste.\"  \"I cannot help it,\" said May, with a little gasp of despair. \"To wait is just what I cannot afford to do. I am almost certain that my coming up next year depends on what I can do this term. We have grown quite poor. Father has lost a great deal of money lately. Even if he were content to send me back here, I do not think it would be right in me to come, unless I could do something to lessen the expense. My sister Annie is in London learning to be a nurse, and my sister Rose is coming out as an artist.\"  \"I thought they were doing it from choice. Why did you not apply yourself before, Miss Millar? You knew what you could do, better than any of us here could possibly guess your talents and attainments. From your general behaviour until the play was started, I for one, I confess, fell into the grave error of supposing that you could do little or nothing, or that any progress you had made was entirely forced work.\" Miss Lascelles spoke sharply, for she was considerably discomfited, and full of unavailing regret for her share in the misadventure.  May could not tell her that she had been too miserable about coming away from home, and leaving her mother and father, Dora and Tray, to apply herself to learning; neither would there have been much use in her applying if she had been destined to fade away presently as she had imagined, and to die, bereft, among the lexicons, commentaries, and lecture-notes of Thirlwall Hall. She preferred to say with meek contriteness that she knew she had been very idle, but she would do her best to atone for her idleness by working every lawful moment of every hour of the few weeks which were left to her, if Miss Lascelles would but allow her to go in for the examination, preparatory to trying for the scholarship.  Miss Lascelles could not prevent her, she told May a little dryly, for the students of Thirlwall Hall, though some of them were no more than seventeen--May's age--were all regarded and treated as grown-up young women capable of judging and acting for themselves. What Miss Lascelles was bound to do was to see that Miss Millar did not run into the opposite extreme, and bring on a brain fever by over-study. \"And you know, my dear,\" finished the kind, experienced woman, who was easily softened, who had always the greatest difficulty to keep from being sympathetic, \"that would be a great deal worse than merely being turned back in your examinations, though Dr. Millar is not rich, and there may be obstacles--I sincerely trust they will not be insurmountable--to your coming back in the autumn, to work with a will and at the same time with moderation.\"  Poor May did not work herself into a brain fever, but she did in other respects exactly as Miss Lascelles--a woman who understood the position--had clearly foreseen. May succeeded in fretting, and worrying, and getting herself into a state of nervous agitation. Her brain, or that part of it which had to do with grammatical declensions, derivations, rules, and principles, became a complete muddle, so that in place of taking in new information, it seemed to be rapidly letting go the old which it had once held securely.  Before the eventful day of May's examination, she had lost the last shred of hope, and so had all who had heard her or formed a correct estimate of the contents of her papers, of her crossing the rubicon. Of her own accord she sorrowfully refrained from making any move to enter the lists for the scholarship.  It is the fashion at St. Ambrose's not to issue the result of the examinations for a considerable number of weeks, during which the unhappy candidates hang on the tenterhooks of expectation. A looker-on is inclined to consider this a refinement of cruelty till he or she has taken into consideration that the motive of the protracted suspense is to suit the convenience and lessen the arduous labours of the toil-worn professors and tutors who serve as examiners.  But in May Millar's case her failure was such a foregone conclusion, was so remedial by reason of her youth, and so qualified by the share she had taken in the Greek play, that a point was stretched for her, and she was privately put out of pain at once. Latterly May had not entertained the slightest expectation of any other sentence, yet the blow fell so heavily upon her that it was well it was the end of the term.  To do Thirlwall Hall no more than justice, everybody was sorry for their youngest, gentlest, prettiest, most inspired, and withal most inoffensive and obliging student. Miss Lascelles took May into her private sitting-room and recklessly lavished the few moments the lady principal had in which to rest and recruit from the fatigue of receiving company, and playing a becoming part in the academical gaieties with which the summer term at St. Ambrose's closes, in order to speak encouraging words to the poor crestfallen child. Miss Vanhansen implored May to cross the herring-pond at her expense, and have a good time among the Barbarian's relations in Ol' Virginny and Kentuck. The girl who had played Alcestis wanted to inaugurate a reading-party in which May should be coached all round every day. Failing this, the same adventurous spirit would get up a series of Greek plays in London drawing-rooms, with Miss Millar's assistance; and so far as she herself was concerned, she would never be contented till Miss Millar played Admetus to her Alcestis. A large deputation of blue-stockinged maidens from Thirlwall Hall escorted May to the railway station, and more than one was relieved to find that she was going first to join her sisters in London instead of carrying the mortification of her failure straight to her country-town home.  It might be the deferring of an ordeal, and yet it was with a white face, as abashed and well-nigh as scared as if she had committed a crime, that May awaited Annie in the drawing-room to which the probationers' friends were free at St. Ebbe's. The consciousness had come too late of having wasted the little money her father had to spare on sentimental self-indulgence and the gratification of her own feelings instead of employing it as it was meant to be employed, in controlling herself and doing her duty, so as to acquire fitting arms for the battle of life.  It was this horrible comprehension which made her wistful eyes grow distended and fixed in their sense of guilt and disgrace. She might have committed a forgery, and be come to tell Annie what she had done. May was essentially one-idea'd at this period of her life, and she had dwelt on the fact of her failure and exaggerated its importance, like the most egotistical of human beings, till it filled her imagination and blotted out every other consideration.  Annie, in the full career of a busy professional morning, snatched a moment between two important engagements to see her sister.  May looked with imploring, fascinated eyes at Annie in her nurse's gown and cap. The younger girl had some faint inkling of Annie's earlier experience in the life of an hospital; yet there she was as fresh and fair and bright as ever--a thousand times cooler and happier-looking than her visitor.  \"Here you are, May,\" Annie was saying in glad greeting, as she held her sister by the two shoulders, after she had kissed her; \"and I declare you have grown since you went to St. Ambrose's. Oh, you incorrigible girl, when you were so much the tallest of us before you went there.\"  May could only make one answer with parched lips, faltering tongue, and eyes dry under their heavy cloud of grief, \"Annie, I have failed in my examination!\"  Annie started in surprise, while her face fell for a second. \"What a pity!\" she could not help exclaiming. \"Father will be----\" She broke off in the middle of the sentence. \"Don't fret about it,\" she added, quickly taking another look into May's face; \"that will do no good, and it is not very much after all. I cannot stay another minute now, May,\" she went on to tell the bewildered girl in the most matter-of-fact tone, so that May was in danger of feeling half-offended at finding her tribulation taken so cavalierly--\"just like Annie!\"  \"You must wait for me,\" Annie was saying further. \"There is a poor fellow--a patient of mine--who is to have his arm amputated this morning, and I must be with him when it is done.\"  \"Oh dear!\" cried May, completely taken aback, \"that is dreadful. Will he die, Annie? Will he die?\" forgetting all her own high-strung woes, the product of an advanced stage of civilization, in heart-felt, human sympathy with the most primitive of all trials--bodily suffering and loss.  \"Not if we can help it, please God,\" said Annie emphatically. Then an inspiration came to her as she gazed on the girl's white quivering face. \"You have been working too hard, 'little May'; you shake your head like a tragedy queen. Then you've been worrying too much, which is a great deal worse. I shall take you in hand, but I can't stay to talk about it. Just you think how little my poor fellow would mind not passing an examination, in comparison with the loss of an arm--fortunately it is the left one. He is a printer who got his arm crushed under one of the great rollers, and he has a wife and five little children dependent on their bread-winner.\"  Annie was gone, leaving May suddenly transported out of herself, and plunged into the trials of her neighbours, the awfully near, common life-and-death trials, of which she had known so little. Her own seemed to sink into insignificance beside them. St. Ambrose's and its intellectual lists and wordy contests, even its lofty abstruse thoughts--excellent things in their way, without which the unlettered world would become rude, sordid and narrow--faded into the background. She forgot everything but the poor man passing through a mortal crisis, with Annie able to succour him in his need, and his wife and children waiting to hear whether the end were life or death.  May held her breath, and watched, prayed, and waited in her turn, with no thought left for the news she had brought to town, and was to carry to Redcross. What did it signify if only the poor man lived when May herself was well and strong, and all her dear friends were in health, and likely to be spared to her.  When Annie came in again with a cheerful face, and said, \"He has stood it wonderfully; there is every prospect of his making a speedy recovery,\" May's face too cleared till for the moment it was almost radiant. She acquiesced, with responsive animation, in Annie's arrangement that since she, Annie, had got leave of absence for the rest of the day she would put on her walking-dress, and she and May too would go and pick up Rose at Mr. St. Foy's class-rooms; and what was to hinder all the three from having an expedition together in the fine summer weather to Hampton Court, or Kew, or the Crystal Palace, thus celebrating May's visit to town, and making the most of Annie's holiday? It would be like dear old times of primrose hunting, blue-bell gathering, maying, and nutting down at Redcross before the cares and troubles of the world had taken hold of the girls. Annie had already sent on May's luggage to Welby Square, to which May would return with Rose. Annie excluded herself carefully from this part of the programme, with a kind of unapproachable haughtiness which had three strains of stubbornness and one strain of fiery youthful anger in its composition, while it was a complete enigma to May. But all she cared to know was that she was going with her own two sisters for an entire afternoon's delightful excursion. In the morning she had felt that she could never have the heart to be happy again. Even yet she would not be quite happy; she would be very much affronted when she was telling Annie and Rose the particulars of her, May's, silliness and selfishness; how she had given herself up to moping, and then how she had played herself--first with the St. Ambrose gaieties, and later with the Greek play, instead of setting about her work methodically and diligently. Annie would, perhaps, tell her a few home-truths, and Rose would crumple up her nose, shake her head, and look superhumanly wise--Rose who in the old days had been more thoughtless than May.  Still she deserved it all a thousand times over, and it would be a relief to have disburdened herself of the sorry tale.  Her own sisters would defend her from every other assailant. They would feel for her, seek to reassure her, even make much of her, as they were doing by taking her away with them this afternoon. May was very sensible that a burden was lifted off her back.     CHAPTER XVIII.  DORA IS THE NEXT MESSENGER WITH BAD TIDINGS.   There is a curious feeling abroad in the world, that no two things happen alike on two days, or in two weeks, or months, running. If there has been a railway accident on Monday, there will certainly not be another of the same kind at the same place on Tuesday. Apart from the fresh precautions sure to be taken, it is not at all likely, in the chapter of accidents, that a facsimile will occur where the original has preceded it so recently. On a similar principle, if a man has been killed or badly injured by a fall from a horse, it goes against public opinion that his son or his brother should also be thus injured. If the singular repetition does take place, people will speak of it with bated breath, as of a fate or doom hanging over the family, and therefore bound to repeat itself again and again on the old lines. All this is in spite of the fact that there is such a word as \"coincidence\" in the language, and that there is hardly one of us who cannot remember several startling coincidences in the course of his or her history.  Annie Millar had an experience of the kind at this time. It was on the 20th of June that May arrived unannounced at St. Ebbe's to recount her lost battle. On the 21st Dora appeared, in a like unlooked-for manner, to divulge her sorrowful news.  Annie was much more troubled by the spectacle of Dora standing alone in the middle of the hospital drawing-room, pale and agitated, than she had been by the discovery of May in that very condition the day before. Annie's own colour died away while she ran forward and caught Dora's hand. \"What is it, Dora? Has anything happened to father or mother?--yet if there had, you would not have left them and come up to town by yourself. Why are you here? Tell me quickly, for it is killing me to keep me in suspense.\"  \"Don't be alarmed,\" entreated Dora's soft voice. \"Father sent me up for the express purpose that you might not be alarmed when you heard. I must have managed badly to frighten you. I assure you nothing has happened, at least nothing very particular, only,--well, father is very rheumatic, and the warm weather has done him no good. He has not been out of the house for a month, though we did not mention it in our letters, always hoping that by the next time we wrote he would be better. But he has not left his room till he contrived to go in the cab yesterday. Oh! Annie, he has sold his business to Dr. Capes. He--father--said it was no use to protract the struggle, it was only doing more mischief; he would never be able, at his age, to go about again so as to act fairly by his patients. He has given up everything to the bank's creditors, and will pass through the bankruptcy court. He bade me tell you that he could see no other way, and he was afraid Rose or you might read his name in the _Gazette_ without being prepared for it.\"  \"Father ill, old, and a bankrupt!\" Annie's cry was bitter. \"It is hard after his long life of honourable industry. I can never forgive Mr. Carey.\"  \"Hush! hush! Annie, you must not say that. Nothing would grieve father more. Nobody has suffered like the Careys. Besides, father always says that he alone was to blame for buying the bank shares. He did it of his own free-will, just that he might grow richer in the idlest manner possible for him to do so. Dr. Capes has taken our house, the Old Doctor's House too, and father and mother went into apartments--those over Robarts the book-seller's--yesterday, till they could look about them.\" Dora was crying quietly all the time she was speaking, and at the same time she was breaking off to say with pathetic resigned trust like her mother's, \"But only think, Annie dear, how much worse it might have been! What a great deal we have to be thankful for. Look at poor Mr. Carey sitting paralyzed, and quite childish; and do you know the sad news arrived last night that poor poor Colonel Russell is dead? He had a sun-stroke, and died within twelve hours; he has not been three months at his new post. Dear father has all his senses, and he says himself he may live for years and years.\"  \"I hope so,\" said Annie fervently; but it is doubtful whether she fully appreciated the blessings of her lot at that moment. She busied herself for a few minutes with Dora, her nurse's instinct as well as her affection telling her that Dora must be seen to first. Annie took off Dora's hat and jacket, seated her in the easiest chair, would hear nothing more till she--Annie--had learnt when Dora had breakfasted, and then rung for a basin of soup and made her swallow it. \"Now, Dora,\" she said, sitting down by her sister, \"tell me all there is to tell. What have father and mother to live upon? We must think and act for them now.\"  Dora explained as well as she was able, since, like her mother, she had no great head for business. In addition to the sum given for the good-will of Dr. Millar's practice, and for his house and furniture, which was to be paid over to the liquidators of the bank's debts, (in return for which the debtor would get a discharge from farther obligations,) a small percentage was to be allowed to him from his successor's fees.  \"I am afraid it will be very small,\" Dora made the despondent remark, \"because, though all his former patients are fond of father, they got to see he was breaking up, and did not like to send for him during the night, or at odd hours. Mother and I did what we could, going round for him and inquiring after his patients; but, as he said, such a make-shift could not last. We were always hearing of more families calling in Dr. Capes or Mr. Newton. Father declared he could not blame them; he would have done the same in their place, and that every dog must have his day.\"  \"That was like father,\" said Annie, looking up with a fleeting sparkle in her eyes.  \"Then we thought,\" went on Dora, \"father and mother might have part of mother's money, since you have always said you did not need it, while Rose is getting paid for her work, and there is hardly any doubt\" (brightening up,) \"but that 'little May' will take the scholarship. She was working so hard to pass her examination when she wrote last, that she was quite out of spirits about her chances, which father says is always the way with the best men when they are going in for an examination that they are safe to win. He supposes it will be still more so with women. He tells mother that he will not mind taking help from her, where her money is concerned, when he can no longer stir from his chair--not to say to earn a fee, but to save his life. He has taken so much more help from her in other ways during all their married life, that this in addition will not count.\"     CHAPTER XIX.  THE UNEMPLOYED--A FAMILIAR FACE.   A lodging was found near the Hospital for Dora, who was to stay in town and look out for a situation; and for the next week, a week of hot summer weather, Annie, relieved from her hospital work, because it was her first holiday time, went to and fro, spending as little as possible on omnibus fares, with Dora and May in her train, in search of employment for them. People were beginning to leave town, and the time did not seem propitious. When was it ever propitious for such a pursuit where women are concerned? Even under Annie's able guidance, with the spirit which she could summon to her aid in all difficulties, the intentional and unintentional rebuffs which the two girl candidates, particularly Dora, got from agents and principals in connection with ladies in want of useful companions and nursery-governesses were innumerable. The swarms of needy, greedy applicants for similar situations whom the Millars were perpetually encountering in their rounds, were enough to cause the stoutest heart to quail, and to sink the most sanguine nature into the depths of despondency.  Dora Millar was not constitutionally sanguine, and she grew more and more nervous and dispirited as the fruitless efforts went on. Her little figure drooped, her eyes had a dejected expression, her lips quivered pathetically without any provocation. Annie was compelled to use strong language. \"The idiots!\" she exclaimed, _apropos_ of the last persons who had found Dora too young or too old, not strong enough looking, or not lively enough looking (\"not as if she could stand a large amount of bullying and worrying,\" Annie read between the lines). \"What a chance they are letting slip through their fingers of getting the most unexacting, contented creature in the world to minister to their tiresome wants. They will never see her like again; serve them right for their blindness.\"  One particularly glaring, airless afternoon, the three sisters were toiling back to Dora's lodging, with the London pavement like heated iron under the feet of the crowds that trod it, and the cloudless sky, in which the sun blazed a ball of fire, like glowing brass over their heads. Then as the Millars turned a corner and looked longingly at the trees in a square with their leaves already yellowing and shrivelling, May uttered a little shriek of delight and darted forward to greet a familiar figure and face in the stream of strangers. What did it signify that the figure was insignificant by comparison, and the face with nothing distinguished in its pallor, under its red beard and moustache?--\"a little foxy-headed fellow,\" any sharp-tongued bystander might have called him. It was a well-known face where all the others were drearily unknown, a Redcross face in London, the face of a man who might have shown himself an enemy, yet had proved a friend in need; and though there had been presented to the girls the bearing of a Jupiter and the lineaments of an Adonis, they could not have hailed him with greater gladness. If anybody hung back in the general acclamation it was Dora, for Annie did not say a word to rebuke May; she was too anxious to hear the last news of her father.  More than one man among the passers-by, glancing at Tom Robinson surrounded by a group of pretty girls, the two prettiest evidently making much of him and hanging on his words, called him in their minds \"lucky dog,\" and speculated on the nature of the attraction.  \"'_Prope'ty, prope'ty, prope'ty_,'\" no doubt. It was disgraceful to see how mercenary even quite young women were getting.  Tom received the ovation, at which, by the bye, he was a little taken aback and puzzled, quietly and in a matter-of-fact way, as he received most things. He had had the pleasure of seeing Dr. and Mrs. Millar lately; indeed, he had availed himself of the privileges of an old friend to call on them at once in their new quarters, he told Annie, and he had found them, by their own account, fairly well and comfortable, though the Doctor was still dead lame.  Tom did not tell either Annie, or any one else interested in the information, that he had spent the last few days pushing the circulation of a subscription list, which he had headed with the promise of a handsome sum. It was to provide a testimonial not altogether inadequate to mark the esteem in which the townspeople held their old Doctor for his many virtues, and their sympathy with him in his misfortunes. A liberal offering on the town's part might do something to relieve the adversity which had befallen a fellow-townsman. The talk a little time ago had been of presenting Dr. Millar with a new brougham and horse, which, as they would have had to be maintained at the charge of a man who had just put down his old brougham as beyond his diminished income, was rather an illogical method of serving him. However, his complete breakdown, with the sale of his practice, had at once knocked that idea on the head, and had given its motive a much wider application. If the little Doctor were to submit to accept help, it must be commensurate with the dignity of Redcross and the county, and with his own professional status and merit.  Tom Robinson looked at the girls as two of them looked at him. \"It is tiring weather,\" he suggested hesitatingly; \"is it wise of you to walk out in the heat?\"  \"Oh! Mr. Robinson,\" cried May effusively, \"we are so tired--just dead beat--though Annie there does not like me to talk slang--but it is so expressive, don't you think so? It is not to-day only, but yesterday and the day before, we have been hunting for situations, and have not found them yet. Do you know, Dora and I are going to take situations immediately if we can get them?\"  His face changed, and he knit his brow involuntarily.  \"What a magpie it is!\" said Annie, impatiently. \"But, of course, you have heard all about the turn father's affairs have taken since this bad rheumatic attack, which he does not believe he can shake off. It need not be any secret that my sisters are looking out for situations.\"  He did not answer; he was prevented by the painful consciousness that Dora appeared ready to sink into the ground.  \"Won't you avail yourself of my arm, Miss Dora? Won't you let me see you home?\" he proposed hurriedly.  She could not refuse; indeed, she was only too thankful for the offered support, though she murmured a protest against troubling him and taking him out of his way. And she could not altogether conceal how put out as well as weary she was, so that the little hand, which just touched his coat-sleeve, fluttered on its resting-place like a newly-caught bird.  He hailed a cab, and wished to put them all into it.  \"I dare say it would be better,\" said Annie, glancing at Dora's white face, with the new trick of quivering which the lips had acquired. As the cab was driving up, she gave Tom Robinson their address--\"17, Little St. Ebbe's Street,\" with the amount of the fare, looking at him almost fiercely while she took the money from her purse. \"Will you be good enough to direct the man and pay him for us?\" she said, and he dared not dispute her will.  But when he yielded, she seemed to think his friendliness and power of comprehension deserved something better than they had got. \"Will you come with us?\" Annie invited him; and when she softened, it was always in such a bright frank way that it was hard to resist her. \"We'll be very pleased to give you a cup of tea at Dora's lodging--at least we can do that for you, and it may be acceptable on such an oppressive afternoon.\"  He, a guest at a lodging of Dora Millar's: it sounded odd enough!  \"Do come, Mr. Robinson,\" his friend May was imploring, while Dora, sensible that something was due from her as the ostensible mistress of the lodging, echoed shyly, without raising her eyes to his face, \"Yes, come, please.\"  Did she remember the last time she gave him tea in the drawing-room of the Old Doctor's House, where they were not likely to meet again? How awkward they found the _tte--tte_. How they shrank from their hands touching, while he reproached her for aiding and abetting May in trying to shirk going to St. Ambrose's; and she had borne his reproaches and admitted the reasonableness of his arguments, with all the meek candour of Dora, while still making a last stand for May.  He went with the girls as if he were in a dream; but he was not left to dream in Dora's very plain lodging, where Annie and not the mistress of the lodging poured out tea, and May insisted on helping him to bread and butter. He saw Rose, too, who had been awaiting the return of her sisters. It sent another pang to his brotherly heart to discover that Rose also was subdued and well-nigh careworn. She still wrinkled her forehead and crumpled up her nose, but it was no longer in the old saucy way; it was under her share of the heavy burden of trouble which had fallen on these dauntless girls and might end by crushing them.  May was not to be kept from the immense solace of making a clean breast to her former ally of her stupid dawdling and trifling, and the retribution which had at once befallen her. \"Did father tell you, Mr. Robinson, that I have failed in my examination?\" she began plaintively. \"Yes, I have, and it was all my own fault. I was too silly; I would not pull myself together and work hard from the first. Now it will never be in my power to go back to St. Ambrose's. I'll not be able to atone for my folly by showing that everybody was not wrong when it was believed that I might be a fair scholar, win a scholarship, and rise to be classical mistress in a girls' school.\" At the announcement of the disastrous failure, by her own deed, of all the ambitious plans for her, May threatened to break down, springing up and turning away, her shoulders heaving in a paroxysm of mortification and grief.  Tom Robinson used to say, afterwards, that he never witnessed a prettier sight than the manner in which the three other girls rallied round their poor \"little May,\" from Annie downwards. They took off her hat, pulled off her gloves, smoothed her ruffled hair, patted her tear-stained cheeks, seated her in an arm-chair, brought her tea, and made her drink it, bidding her not be too disheartened. They pledged themselves--even Dora pledged herself stoutly--that, if it rested with them, and they were young and strong, they would find work of one kind or another--May should go back to St. Ambrose's some day and vindicate her scholarliness. Father and mother and all of them would be proud of her.  It rendered the man doubly indignant from that day when he heard scoffers say that there could be no true friendship between women, and that the relation of sisters existed simply for the growth of rivalry and jealousy.  May was still shaking her head disconsolately, and reminding him, \"Ah, Mr. Robinson, it would have been better if you had let me stay at home and go into your shop, like Phyllis Carey. I might have done some good there, though you may not believe it, and only feel glad that you got rid of me.\"  Then he took her in hand, and administered his consolation. \"Nonsense, Miss May,\" he said, with sufficient peremptoriness for a man who had been rather accustomed to efface himself in these girls' presence, \"you were not to be suffered to hide your light under a bushel. I wonder to hear you--I thought you had more pluck and perseverance. How many times do you think the young fellows at St. Ambrose's are turned back and have to try again? If I passed in my first exam, it was by the merest fluke, as three-fourths of the men will tell you they pass. As for my degree, I had the common sense and modesty to put off taking it to the last moment, and to stay up two different vacations, 'sapping' like a Scotchman, before I ventured to undergo the test. You don't mean to say you are too proud to do at Rome as the Romans do, that your genius will brook no rejection, and declines to grapple with an obstacle? I'll tell you what your father proposes for you, and let me say that I believe it would do him a world of good--now that he has been forced to give up his patients, and is confined to his chair. He has not lost heart and faith in your powers--of course not. He is thinking quite eagerly of brushing up his classics in his enforced leisure, and himself becoming your coach for the next six months. I need not say that any small assistance I can offer is heartily at your service also.\"  \"Oh!\" said May, with wistful brown eyes and a long-drawn sigh, \"you are a great deal too good to me, all of you. I don't deserve it. It would only be too much happiness for me to have father and you to coach me--but I know we could not afford it.\"  \"Wait and see,\" said Tom succinctly.  \"If I got that situation,\" said Dora timidly, \"I might do something to help May: I mean the one where the lady said she would take me into consideration, but we thought it would not do, because I should have to go out to Jamaica. On second thoughts, I am not sure that I'd mind so very much going. The lady seemed to consider I might be able to do what she required, and I should only be away for a year or two, since the family are coming back then. The salary was very good.\"  Dora go out to Jamaica to help May, or any one else! Not though he had to fling cheques in at the windows, and squeeze Bank of England notes through the keyholes, to prevent it.  \"Hester Jennings says she would not be very much surprised if she heard of a buyer for my tulip picture; but I don't know,\" said Rose doubtfully, glancing at the picture, which was on an adjoining table.  \"May I look at it?\" asked Tom Robinson, jumping up with alacrity, probably to make a diversion in the conversation from the obnoxious topic of Dora's problematical voyage to Jamaica. He had seen Rose's work at Redcross, and he could give it as his honest opinion that she had made a great advance in her art, though he did not profess to be a judge. He said, however, that he had a friend, an old St. Ambrose crony, who was an artist. They had happened to be together in Rome at a later date, had been a good deal thrown on each other's company there, and had continued to keep up a friendly intercourse. He requested permission for his friend to call and look at the little picture. He might be of use to Rose in disposing of it; he was always ready to help a fellow-artist. Tom supposed the Millars had heard his friend's name, it was pretty well known; indeed they might have seen him, for Pemberton and Lady Mary, his wife, had spent a few days with Tom at Redcross, and had been in church on the Sunday during their visit, the summer before last.  In spite of the obligations of good breeding, the Millars looked at each other in open-mouthed astonishment. Certainly they had heard of Pemberton the distinguished landscape painter, and they had been told that he had married into the peerage, as Aunt Penny had married into the county. The girls also remembered perfectly the quiet-looking young couple who had been noticed walking about with Tom Robinson the July before last. People had wondered languidly who the strangers could be--whether they were cousins far removed on Tom's father's side of the house, since they did not quite answer to the style of his mother's yeomen kindred. But it was an effort to the provincial mind to identify the unobtrusive-looking pair with the Pembertons, to realize that Mr. Pemberton and his Lady Mary had actually come and stayed the better part of a week with Tom Robinson. They could hardly have been ignorant of \"Robinson's,\" whose master was only received into the upper-class houses of the town on a species of sufferance.  The peerage must have unique rules by which to frame its standards. There was the Hon. Victoria, Mrs. Carey's niece by marriage, who, when Carey's Bank was in full bloom, would hardly be seen in the streets of Redcross, and scarcely deigned to acknowledge her own aunt-in-law. As to the familiarity of staying a night in the Bank House, she would never have dreamt of it. In this respect she did little credit to the teaching of her old governess, Miss Franklin, who had shown herself a philosopher in her own person. Perhaps, when it came to stooping at all, the peerage felt it might as soon, and with a still more gracious and graceful effect, bend low as bend slightly. Perhaps in the peerage, as in every other class, there are all sorts and conditions of mind and heart.  A little clue might have been supplied to account for the eccentricity of the Pembertons, and to lessen the shock of their conduct to the Millars, if the latter had been made acquainted with one circumstance. About the time of the stay of the artist and his wife in Rome, where he had been only too glad to run up against a favourite old college chum, when the three had been making a long excursion in company beyond the Campagna, Pemberton had been suddenly attacked in a remote little town with a violent illness.  His poor young wife would have been utterly frightened and forlorn had it not been for the moral courage and untiring good offices of the third person in the company--Tom Robinson.  Tom did not appear conscious of the sensation he had created by the mention of his friend. He arranged when Mr. Pemberton should come and view Rose's picture to suit Rose's convenience, and not that of the famous and courted artist. Then he explained in all sincerity, before he took his leave, that he, Tom Robinson, was very sorry he could not have the pleasure of bringing Pemberton and introducing him personally, because a business engagement called the master of \"Robinson's\" back to Redcross early next morning.  The party he left were quite silent and still for a moment after he had gone, till what she had heard of Mr. Pemberton went to Rose's head to such a degree that she rose, whirled round on tiptoe, and caused her spread-out frock to perform the feat which children call \"making a cheese.\"  \"Won't it be delicious to know Mr. Pemberton and get his advice--perhaps one day presume to ask him how he does his hay-fields and orchards? What will Hester Jennings say! I say, we'll have Hester to meet him; she will come for such a painter though the whole peerage would not get her to budge an inch. I wish we could tone her down a little bit, but he must just swallow her whole. She is good and clever enough to be permitted that rugged line of her own. Oh! but isn't Tom Robinson a trump? I _will_ be slangy, Annie--as May says, it is so expressive.\"  \"Yes, yes,\" chimed in May enthusiastically, in reference to the man and not to the slang. \"I have known it ever since he came up like a lion--why do you laugh, Rose?--and rescued Tray--don't you remember, Dora?--from that horrid brute of a collie. Tray bit him--Mr. Robinson, I mean--not knowing that he was his best friend, and he only laughed. He was so kind about my wishing to go into his shop, like Phyllis Carey, though he would not take me. I think it must be a privilege, as Miss Franklin tells Phyllis, to serve him. She says all the nice people in the shop have the greatest regard for him.\"  \"I am so sorry and ashamed that I ever drew caricatures of him,\" said Rose, in pensive penitence. \"I think, whenever I am able, I must paint his portrait, as I see him now, to make up for it.\"  \"And ask him to have it hung above the oak staircase in the shop,\" suggested Annie, a little satirically. But she added immediately, \"Though it broke no bones to dwell on his lack of height and his foxy complexion, I am rather sorry now that I did it, because I have ceased to think that these objectionable details deserved to be made of any consequence. On the contrary, I own to the infatuation of beginning to see that there is something fine in them. I suppose I shall be calling Tom Robinson's hair golden, or tawny, or chestnut soon, and his inches the proper height for a man. It is true,\" broke off Annie, with sudden, unaccountable perversity, \"I do hate great lumbering flaxen-haired giants.\" She blushed furiously after she had indulged in the last digression, and hastened to resume the main thread of the conversation. \"As for Tom Robinson's having little to say, I declare that my present impression is that he says quite enough, and very much to the purpose too. It was so nice and like a gentleman of him not to propose immediately to buy Rose's picture when she talked rashly of her anxiety that it should find a purchaser.\"  \"I don't think Cyril Carey, with all his airs, would have shown so much delicacy in the old days,\" said Rose.  \"Or that Ned Hewett, though Ned has such a kind heart, would have been able to avoid blundering into some such offer,\" remarked May.  There was one person who remained absolutely silent while the others sang Tom Robinson's praises, and it might be her silence which called her sisters' attention to her.  \"I wonder what you would have, Dora?\" said Rose, with several shades of superciliousness in her voice and in her lifted-up nose.  \"I cannot understand how you could be such a cruel, hard-hearted girl,\" May actually reproached her devoted slave.  \"There is such a thing as being too particular,\" Annie had the coolness to say. \"I am sure I do not go in for indiscriminate marriages or for falling in love,\" she added with lofty decision. \"It has always been a mystery to me what poor Fanny Russell could see to care for, or to do anything save laugh at, in Cyril Carey. I hope the elderly 'competition wallah,' or commissioner, or whatever he is, whom she is going to marry, has more sense as well as more money. For her marriage was arranged, though the news had not reached England, mother writes, before the tidings of Colonel Russell's death came. But when a man who can act as Tom Robinson has acted crosses a woman's path and pays her the compliment of asking her to be his wife, I do think she should be careful what she answers.\"  Dora stared as if she were losing her senses. Were they laughing at her still? Could they be in earnest? If so, how was it possible for them to be so flagrantly inconsistent and unjust? She could only utter a single exclamation. But as the worm will turn, the exclamation was emphatic and indignant enough. \"Well!\" she cried, in utter amazement and incipient rebellion. \"Well!\" and she returned the challenging gaze of the circle with a counter-challenge, before which all eyes except Annie's fell.  Annie had the audacity to look Dora in the face and echo the \"Well!\" nay, to say further, \"You never heard of anything so disgraceful as for us to turn upon you and find fault with you for refusing Tom Robinson, when all the time it was we who laughed at him, and scouted his shop, keeping you up to the point of dismissing him without delay? Quite true, Dora, dear; but then it was you, and not _us_, whom he was proposing to marry! and a girl old enough to receive such a proposal should have the wit to judge for herself--should she not? She ought to cultivate the penetration to look beneath the surface in so important a matter, and then fewer lamentable mistakes would be made. However, nobody could expect you to put force on your inclinations, and he does not bear you malice.\"  Annie did not regard her share in the matter so cheerfully and lightly when she was in the privacy of a ward of St. Ebbe's, where she had begged to sit up with an unconscious patient, just to keep her hand in and compose her feelings.  \"What mischievous little wretches we were,\" she reflected, as she deftly changed the wet cloth on the sick woman's hot forehead. \"How happy he might have made Dora, and how happy she might have made him! She is so single-minded and tender-hearted, that she could hardly have failed to see his merits, if we had given him the chance, let her alone, and left the pair to themselves. Then, if the worst were to come to the worst,\" and Annie frowned with anxiety and grief, as well as with wholesome humiliation, \"if poor father and mother cannot get along, and none of us girls can help them effectually, his house might have been their home, where he would never have let them feel other than honoured guests. He would have been a son to them. But the mischief is done, and there is no help for it. If Dora and he were an ordinary couple, it might be mended; but now she will not look at him when we none of us have a penny, because she refused him when we were in comfortable circumstances; and he will not renew his suit with the thought in his mind that it would look and feel to her as if any favour he has magnanimously conferred on us, were a mere bribe to compel her to listen to him. So, Annie Millar, this is a pretty kettle of fish, of which you have been chief cook! There is the greater reason for you to make up your mind from this moment to devote yourself wholly to your family, and let nothing--_nothing_,\" she protested with suspicious vehemence, \"come between you and them.\"  \"What is it, you poor soul?\" the young nurse responded quickly to a movement of the helpless ailing creature beside her. \"Do you know there is somebody here? Will it ease you to have your head raised on my arm, do you think? You cannot hear or answer, but we'll try that, and then it is just possible you may drop asleep.\" And for the rest of the watch Annie was absorbed in care for her patient.     CHAPTER XX.  REDCROSS AGAIN.   Tom Robinson's subscription list attained the respectable sum-total of two thousand pounds. Many of the subscribers were not only patients of Dr. Millar, but creditors of the bank whose claims he had striven with sturdy honesty to satisfy, till the task proved too hard for his years.  The little Doctor received the token of how greatly his courage and staunchness in the fulfilment of his obligations had been respected, with half pained, half pleased gratitude, and this was very much the attitude of mind of his daughter Annie. The rest of his womankind, from Mrs. Millar to May, only felt a glad surprise, and a soft, proud thankfulness.  The relief from present difficulties was great, but of course the gift did not obviate the necessity for the girls seeking work and wages. Even May, when she ventured to hope that she might stay at home for a month or two and be coached by her father and Tom Robinson in anticipation of a more successful campaign at St. Ambrose's, was eagerly speculating whether she might not become a coach in her turn. She was fain to earn a little money by helping the very youngest of the Grammar School boys to prepare their Latin grammar in the evenings, supposing she could get them to sit still, and give over wishing her to play with them.  Mr. Pemberton had not only himself called on the Miss Millar who was the artist, he had brought Lady Mary with him, and both husband and wife had turned out the refined, thoroughly unassuming, kindly disposed couple they had looked. They spoke warmly of Tom Robinson as their very good friend, and went so far as to express enthusiasm for his beautiful old shop. Mr. Pemberton did better than merely say a few words of languid, indiscriminating praise of Rose's picture, and then bow himself out. He examined the picture closely, and looked at her thoughtfully and attentively out of the dark gray eyes, the only good feature in his face. The next moment, to Hester Jennings's great edification, he addressed Rose seriously as a member of the Guild of St. Luke--not an amateur, \"one of ourselves, so that you must not mind what I say to you, Miss Millar.\" He first displayed a generous capacity for discovering something good, whether it were to be found in the work of a tyro or of a veteran. Next he took the trouble of pointing out the faults, and urging their remedy, telling her the picture was worth the pains of making it as true as possible, until Rose hung her head in blended pride and humility.  What was more, he offered to enter into negotiations with a picture-dealer on her behalf, and brought them to a triumphant conclusion, making Rose happy with so fair a price as materially to lighten the millstone of her resigned office at the Misses Stone's hanging round her neck.  It was settled that May should go home and profit by the coaching which awaited her at Redcross, taking the chance of finding some little boys whose Latin grammar would be the better of her supervision.  Next Mr. Pemberton wrote that Lady Mary had been so charmed with the neighbourhood of Redcross, and had spoken so highly of it to one of her cousins, who had a great liking for English landscape, and was just refurnishing his town house, that he wished to commission a set of water-colour sketches of such and such spots for his morning-room. It was Mr. Pemberton's opinion that Miss Rose Millar could execute the commission to Sir John Neville's satisfaction, if she cared to accept of it.  \"It is to help me,\" said Rose humbly, \"for there are hundreds of good artists who would take the work and be thankful, and do it far better, though I will do my very best. Tom Robinson is at the bottom of it directly or indirectly, but he is like an old friend. I don't know a man to whom I would sooner be obliged.\"  In the third instance, a totally unforeseen application was made to Annie. A fever, in certain respects unfamiliar in its type, broke out at Stokeleigh, one of several suburban villages on the outskirts of Redcross. Some authorities called the fever Russian, and declared it had been imported--they did not pretend to say how--from that remote empire. Others insisted it was a slow fever, of English growth, with curious complications. It appeared doubtful whether it were infectious; but there was one thing which was unmistakable, that, whatever kind of malaria brooding in the summer air was at the root of the complaint, that malaria showed a disposition to spread extensively. It passed from Stokeleigh to the adjoining village of Woodleigh, whence it took a bend in the direction of the town, and proceeded to squat, as malarias can squat, and settle indefinitely on all the low-lying districts of Redcross. Neither did the epidemic improve in character with the change of locality. For, whereas on the higher, less encumbered ground the fever had been rarely fatal, the mortality increased with the transfer of the disease to the crowded, damp purlieus of the older part of the town, built more or less on the Dewes, and liable to be invaded by the river in flood.  A combined meeting of the Town Council and Vestry, with the Mayor, who happened to be a public-spirited man, and the Rector heading it, determined on taking prompt action to stop the mischief. The town had lately built a Corn Exchange in one of the highest, best-ventilated situations in Redcross. It was to be committed to the care of a town's officer and his wife, who were to have the adjoining rooms rent-free for a domicile, together with certain perquisites, in return for sweeping, scrubbing, and looking after the hall. But the place was just finished, and had not yet been occupied in the manner intended. It was proposed to convert it, in the absence of other accommodation, into a temporary ward for the sufferers from fever. The doctors consulted, pledged themselves that there was every probability of the unwelcome visitor being thus stamped out, while the chances of recovery for the patients would be multiplied. It was also agreed to bring a trained nurse from some nursing institution, to mould the raw nursing materials which Redcross supplied on the emergency. Dr. Millar's successor had a bright idea that it might be a graceful act on his part to mention the old Doctor's daughter, who had gone in for nursing as a profession. She had already served nearly a year in a great London hospital, and was no doubt competent to undertake the duties required. It would be a compliment to her and her father to try and get her for the occasion, and there would be a certain _clat_ in her coming to the help of her native town in its need. Dr. Capes was right as to the popularity of his motion. It was received with unanimous approval. Annie, the matron, and the directors of St. Ebbe's, were immediately applied to in proper form. Annie burned to go, if such a step were admissible at the present stage of her career. The favour she had won on all sides aided in the fulfilment of her wishes. She was promoted from the ranks of the probationers to those of the nurses while yet her year wanted a fraction of its complete round, and was officially sent down to represent the nurses of St. Ebbe's at Redcross.  \"Of course, Dora, you cannot be left behind to go on by yourself hunting for a situation with three-fourths of the great world out of town. I am afraid you would make a poor job of it at the best, Dora dear, and at the worst it is not to be thought of; it would be a waste of nerve-tissue and muscle, as well as of pounds, shillings, and pence. You will come too; we'll be all together, or nearly together, again, for a holiday, after all.\"  Dora, who had been waiting patiently for Annie's decision, was nothing loth.  \"Rose's expenses and mine are more than paid,\" calculated the practical Annie, \"so that we shall be no drag on father and mother. I don't know if Robarts's accommodation will extend beyond the additional bedroom for Rose and May, but that can be easily managed. Oh! I have it, Dora, you will stay with me at the hospital--the Corn Exchange I mean--and save me from having a housekeeper for the short time one will be wanted. I'll take care that no infection, if there be infection, will come near you. Oh, 'won't it be jolly,' as Rose says, for you and me to keep house by ourselves at dear old Redcross, of all places in the world?\"  It was arranged so, with only a little demur from Mrs. Millar, over-ruled by her husband.  There was another person, without right or power to enter his veto against the existing order of things, who nevertheless decidedly demurred at them. Tom Robinson showed that though he might be a humane man there were bounds to his humanity. \"It is all very well for Annie Millar to come down and nurse the fever patients, it is in the way of her business, she does as much every day, she is well acquainted with all the precautions to take. But Dora is not a nurse, she never thinks of herself, she will forget to take the precautions if she has ever heard of them. She has not strong nerves, and she is used up with this preposterous stumping of London in July in search of a situation. What in the name of common sense and natural affection do they mean by lugging Dora into the risk!\" he grumbled and worried. \"Oh! yes, of course she would follow Annie or any of the rest of them fast enough if she had the opportunity, though she were to die at the end of it; but she ought never to have had the opportunity, it was preposterous to let her. The whole thing is monstrous. I never heard of such rashness. What can Dr. and Mrs. Millar be thinking of?\"  It felt queer, to say the least of it, as well as \"jolly,\" to be at Redcross and not at the Old Doctor's House, over which a bride of yesterday was presiding, for Dr. Capes's marriage had taken place simultaneously with his purchase of Dr. Millar's practice.  Annie used to look over from the opposite side of the street, as she was walking along, at the alterations which were being made in the garden, and the new arrangement of the window curtains, and try to criticize them impartially. Then she had to call and see Dr. Capes, and wait in the familiar consulting-room till he insisted on taking her to the drawing-room, in order to introduce her to his wife, who had come a stranger to Redcross. Annie felt as if she were a disembodied spirit, or a dreamer in a dream from which she could not awake, while she gazed on the changed yet well-known aspect of everything around her. But she had to think of Dr. and Mrs. Capes, in whose house she was, and talk civilly to them of their improvements(!). She had to emulate the submission of Dora, who had seen the transfer coming and taken part in it. She had to copy the mercurial spirits of Rose and May. They were so pleased to be with their father and mother again, and to take possession of Phyllis Carey's every free moment, that they declared the Robarts's apartments were the very nicest the girls had ever seen. They, the apartments, were delightfully cosy (which meant stuffy in July). They were more cheerful (noisier) than the Old Doctor's House. It was great fun for the pair to stow themselves and their belongings within such narrow compass.  A serious vexation to Annie at the commencement of her enterprise was the arrival of Dr. Harry Ironside to diagnose and make what he could of the fever.  \"What is he doing here? His coming at all is most impertinent,\" cried Annie indignantly, sitting down on one of the still empty beds in the barrack-like hall, and as it were daring Rose and May, who had brought the news, and Dora who was listening to them, to contradict her.  \"He is come in the pursuit of knowledge,\" said Rose, with full command of her countenance. \"He does not understand Russian fever, or whatever it is, and he thinks he had better make its acquaintance as a wind up to taking his degree. He is still a doctor at large; he has not fixed on where he is to go and what he is to do next, so his sister Kate writes to me.\"  \"Then he and his sister Kate had better make up their minds to go away together, somewhere else, and not trouble other people,\" cried Annie quite illogically.  \"Why, Annie, father thinks it is very praiseworthy of Dr. Ironside to seek to get all the information he can before settling down as a doctor,\" remonstrated May in the guilelessness of her heart. \"He has just been calling on father, who is delighted with him--so is mother; and, for _my_ part,\" finished the speaker with unconscious emphasis, as if her opinion were of the utmost consequence, \"I have thought him very nice since the first time I met him at Mrs. Jennings's. He is so big and handsome, without being stuck up, or a swell, like what Cyril Carey used to be--just frank and pleasant as a man should be. I cannot comprehend why you have such a dislike to him.\"  \"Upon my word!\" exclaimed Annie, with a gasp. \"But I don't care,\" she added vehemently; \"he shall not come and carry on his investigations here. Dr. Capes and I, with father to appeal to, and Mr. Newton to call in and consult, if necessary, are more than sufficient for all the patients we are likely to get. I tell you, if he forces his way into my hospital I'll have nothing more to do with it; I'll throw it all up and go back to St. Ebbe's at once.\"  \"But it is not your hospital, Annie,\" said Rose with provoking matter-of-factness. \"It is the town's, or if it is under the control of any private person, it is under Dr. Capes's orders. For the sake of his professional character, medical etiquette, and all that kind of thing, he will not refuse to allow a fellow-doctor to study the fever cases under his care. Dr. Harry was going to stay at the 'Crown,' but he met Tom Robinson, who said he should be his guest, and carried him off to his house.\"  \"Just like Tom Robinson!\" declared Annie with amazing asperity.  \"Come along, May.\" Rose hurried away her sister and satellite, and then let loose her glee. \"It is too funny, May; too preposterously funny. It is ever so much better than Dora and Tom Robinson. He was so easily rebuffed, and she was so reluctant to rebuff him. But here is Annie like one of the furies, and Harry Ironside is silly enough to mind her, so that he can hardly open his mouth before her, and looks as if he had lost his wits. Before Annie! What is our Annie, I should like to know, that she should daunt a clever, high-spirited young fellow such as he is? What strange glamour has she thrown over him? But he has plenty of mettle and determination for all that, and she will no more manage by her tirades to stop him from coming after her and laying siege to her ladyship, than she can keep the sun from shining or the rain from falling. For that matter, I believe the poor fellow cannot help himself; it is the case of the moth and the candle.\"  \"But what is it all about?\" demanded May, in an utter confusion of ideas. \"She speaks as if she hated him, and I thought he had come to Redcross to trace the course of the Russian fever.\"  \"To trace the course of his own fortunes. I beg your pardon, my dear, but you might have known enough of human nature to guess that there was a private personal motive at the bottom of his philanthropy.\"  \"Then it is the worse for him and a great pity,\" said May, with the sweet seriousness into which one phase of her childishness was passing. \"I wonder you can laugh, Rose. I am always affronted when I remember how we laughed at Tom Robinson and poor Dora, making game of what was no joke to them. And Dora was not half so much opposed to Tom as Annie is to this unfortunate, nice, pleasant young doctor. I could find it in my heart to be very sorry for him.\"  \"Oh! you are a simpleton apart from Latin and Greek. Don't you see that Annie's wrath is neither more nor less than fright? She is frightened out of her senses at him, because she wants to keep her independence and share our fortunes. As I do not remember to have seen her in such a scare before, I should say that she is paying him a high compliment.\"  \"I think it is rather a queer compliment,\" objected May in much perplexity.      \"'Though you should choose to dissemble your love,       Why need you kick me down-stairs?\"  quoted Rose. \"Oh! but the poet did not know the world, or pretended not to know it. I assure you there are many wise men who would much rather be kicked in this way than be civilly spoken to. Kate Ironside thought fit to confide to me how much interested she was in a suit which, if it ever succeeded, would make us all brothers and sisters. She was so good as to add that while she was aware Harry always knew best, and she had entire faith in his choice, still she was not entirely of his mind--I don't believe Annie has ever spoken to her, lest speech with the sister should be taken for encouragement to the brother. It is only natural perhaps that, as Kate ventured to admit, on the whole she would have preferred _me_.\"  \"And what did you say to that?\" asked the deeply-interested May.  \"No, thanks, though I was much obliged, or something like it. I added with some dignity, I flatter myself, though really such dignity is thrown away on Kate, that for the present I was wedded to my art, like Queen Elizabeth to her kingdom, and to my sister Maisie. Besides, nothing could, would, or should ever induce me to meddle with my sister Annie's property, since, according to Kate's own account, it was for love of Annie, and not of me, that Harry Ironside took up his residence under Mrs. Jennings's roof.\"  But Annie had to give way to some extent. She was compelled to grant an interview to the aggressor. Dr. Ironside arrived on a special errand to the hospital, and he took up the position that Miss Millar was entitled to be consulted. Tom Robinson had been attacked with every symptom of the fever. He and Tom had agreed, in view of the public character of \"Robinson's,\" and with the idea that the step might do good, by serving as an example, that the patient should come to the hospital and be laid up there, where Dr. Harry Ironside was ready to devote himself to the case.  \"I believe Tom Robinson has taken the fever on purpose,\" said Annie to the shocked Dora. \"But he shall not have much of my attendance; he may stick to his Dr. Ironside. Dr. Capes tells me he has induced a married woman, with a family, who has a brother and a nephew lodging with her, both of them down with fever, to send them here, so that I shall have them to look after. Now that there is a beginning made,\" Annie smoothed her ruffled plumes, and waxed cheerful, \"if the hot weather does not change, and the disease is not checked, we are likely to have plenty of patients on our hands, with the opportunity of showing what service we can render them and the town.\"  Just as Annie predicted, the rows of beds began to fill, and she had no lack of occupation; but she changed her tale with regard to Tom Robinson when his case, among many which yielded readily to treatment, and proved triumphantly the gain to be got from a better locality and fresher air, was first grave, then dangerous, and at last verged on hopeless. Now she turned to the worst case on her list, and made it her chief care. She became totally unmindful of the fact that she was thus brought into constant contact with Harry Ironside, that it was he and she who were together fighting death, inch by inch, with desperate endeavour, for the prize which the last enemy threatened to snatch from their hands. Indeed, so entirely did Annie, like the excellent nurse and kind-hearted woman she was, lose sight of her own concerns in the interest of her patient, that she was heard to contradict herself, and record her sincere thankfulness for the strong support of Harry Ironside's presence in the light of the valuable aid he could afford at such a time.  \"He was thought very clever at St. Ebbe's. He took his degree with high honours. He was held in much esteem by all the older doctors,\" she explained to all who cared to hear. \"He is in possession of all the latest light on his profession. Now, I have heard father say, and what I have seen confirms it, that though Dr. Capes is most painstaking, and has had a good deal of experience as a general practitioner, he has no great natural ability, and he was not in circumstances to pursue his studies longer than was absolutely necessary to enable him to pass as a medical man. After all I take back my word. I am very glad for poor Tom Robinson's sake that Dr. Harry Ironside is here. No doubt we could have summoned a great specialist from London, but he would only have stayed a short time, and men like him have generally many critical cases on their minds. Now Dr. Harry Ironside is on the spot, and he can watch every turn of the disease which he came to master, and devote his whole attention to this example. I consider Tom Robinson is exceedingly fortunate in getting the chance of such scientific treatment.\"  But in spite of the good fortune and the devotion spent on him; it looked as if Tom were going to slip through the hands so bent on detaining him, and to die as quietly as he had lived.  When Redcross realized how even the balance was, and how heavily he was swimming for his life, the whole town woke up to his good qualities as a citizen, to what a useful life his comparatively short one had been, to how many benefits he had conferred without the slightest assumption of patronage or superiority of any kind.  It is unnecessary to say that \"Robinson's\" was figuratively in the deepest mourning, only rousing itself from its despair to proclaim his merits and those of his father before him, as masters. Men gravely pointed out the old servants he had pensioned; those in middle age whom he had kept on when their best days were past; the boys he had already taken in, fitted out, and launched on the world by judicious, unostentatious backing. Women tearfully reminded the listener how carefully he had provided for their comfort and well-being throughout his establishment, from the ample time allowed for their meals and the seats to which they could retire when not actually serving, to the early closing hours, which afforded them and the men who were their associates, some leisure for out-of-doors exercise and indoors recreation. As for mental and spiritual improvement, he was always ready to subscribe liberally to libraries, choral unions, friendly societies, Christian associations, missionary boxes--every conceivable means of rational pleasure, culture, and true human elevation of which his people would avail themselves.  Mrs. Carey called at the Corn Exchange and offered her unprofessional services as a nurse, if further aid were wanted.  Mr. Pemberton, acquainted with the fact of Tom Robinson's illness through communicating with Rose Millar on her commission, wrote that he could hardly keep Lady Mary from descending on Redcross to see after their friend, and if it would be the least good she would come down. It would be but a poor return for the aid Robinson had lent her when her husband lay desperately sick and she had nobody to appeal to, save the fat and fatuous _padrone_ of a miserable little Italian inn.  May, who was at last prevented from coming to her sisters, presented herself when they went to their father's, her eyes swollen with weeping for her \"coach.\"  Every time Annie left the transformed hall of the Exchange and repaired to the rooms which she and Dora occupied, she found a white face on the watch for her, and pale lips which could hardly form the syllables, \"How is he now? Oh! Annie, must he die?\" At least Dora was on the spot to hear each hour's report, as if she had been his nearest relative, and without asking herself the reason why, that was a little bit of comfort to her. In the same manner Tom Robinson derived a dim satisfaction from the fact that he was lying there under the same roof with Dora Millar, as he would have been supposing she had listened to his suit eighteen months ago, and he had fallen ill in the early days of their marriage. He was afraid it was pure selfishness which made him cease to resent her presence in close proximity to the fever ward, as he had resented it when he did not imagine he might be one of its patients. Sometimes he had a dim fancy that he heard her soft voice through the closed doors, and that it soothed him, though he might be only dreaming, or it was possible that there were tones in Annie's clear voice which under certain emotions of pity and tenderness answered to those of her sister.  Often Annie just shook her head sorrowfully as she warned Dora off till the nurse's dress could be changed. Occasionally she cried out petulantly, \"If he would only be impatient, and fret and grumble like other people; if he would not take things so quietly; if he would resist and struggle, I believe he might fight the battle and win it yet. I think he will get over the crisis, but what of that if there is no rallying? He is letting life go because he will not grasp it hard, I suppose for the reason that he has no strong ties to bind him to it. He has either such a poor opinion of his deserts, or such a trust in Providence, that he considers whatever is is best, and does not exert himself to alter the course of events so far as it is in his power. It is beautiful in theory, but it does not always answer in practice. I am not certain whether it does not proceed, after all, from constitutional indolence, or the want of ambition, of which I used to accuse him, or whether he is really too good to live. Anyhow, skill and nursing are wasted upon him.\"  Dr. Hewett came to see Tom Robinson, and took the seat which Harry Ironside vacated for him, leaving the old friends together.  \"Hallo, Rector! It is strange for me to meet you here,\" said Tom's feeble voice, while the ghost of his old shy smile passed over his haggard face.  \"It is equally strange for me to meet you, Robinson,\" said the Rector, with an inconvenient lump in his throat.  \"What a deal of trouble I'm giving,\" said Tom regretfully.  \"Tut, man, nobody grudges the trouble, if you will but pick up and get well again,\" said the clergyman, almost roughly.  \"I can see that Ironside thinks badly of me,\" said Tom in his quiet way, \"and as far as feelings go, it seems to me I have reason to think badly of myself.\"  \"We are all in good hands, Tom,\" said Dr. Hewett, seeing again the boy who used to play in the Rectory garden with Ned, and speaking to him in the old fashion.  \"I know that,\" answered Tom. \"I have known it all along, which has been a blessing to me,\" he added, a little as if he were speaking of a third person. Then he roused himself further. \"I want to tell you where my will is. I don't like to hurt a woman's feelings by speaking of it to my kind, indefatigable nurse. Besides, the Millars will benefit by it.\"  \"The old man,\" sighed the Rector, \"always thinking of others before yourself.\"  \"'I know that my Redeemer liveth,'\" was Tom's testimony; \"speak to me of Him, Rector, while I am able to hear,\" said the sick man, in the tone of one whose ears were growing dull to earthly sounds.     CHAPTER XXI.  MISS FRANKLIN'S MISTAKE.   Tom Robinson went still deeper into the shadow of the valley, possibly as far as man ever went and returned. He grew as weak and helpless as an infant, until at last he lost consciousness, and lay prostrate and still, with closed eyes and sealed ears--nothing alive in him save the subtle principle which is compared to a vapour and a breath which no man can see or handle, yet whose presence or absence makes all the difference between an animated body still linked to both worlds and a mass of soulless clay hastening to corruption. All that skill and devotion could do--and Tom Robinson had them both--was to keep on without despairing, maintaining warmth against the growing chillness, and administering stimulants and nourishment by spoonfuls and drops.  On the night which it was feared would be Tom Robinson's last, Miss Franklin would no longer be denied her place among the watchers. She had been kept away in obedience to poor Tom's express orders, that in the attempt to minimize the fever no communication should be kept up on his account between the Corn Exchange where he lay and either his house or \"Robinson's,\" notwithstanding the proofs that the disease did not spread by contagion or infection.  Miss Franklin did not desire to dispossess Annie of the post which, in spite of every remonstrance, she was holding latterly almost night and day. Miss Franklin had no faculty for nursing, and small experience to guide her. She was rather a nervous woman in her impulsiveness, and after one look at what was like the mask of Tom Robinson, utterly incapable of recognizing her or communicating with her, she was so much overcome that she was fain to retire to another room and submit to be gently ministered to by Dora.  Miss Franklin was only too thankful to be suffered to stay there in the background. It did not strike her as odd that nobody in the house except the other patients should go to sleep that night when her cousin was hovering between life and death--nearer death than life. Neither had the outspoken, kind-hearted gentlewoman any particular application of her speech in her mind when she said sorrowfully--\"Dear! dear! how grieved he would be if he knew how worn out you were, Miss Dora. He thought that his coming to the hospital would not only serve as a precedent, it would be the simplest, safest, least troublesome plan where he himself was concerned, though if he would have let me, I should have been only too glad to have turned my back on 'Robinson's' for a time, and done what I could for him. There is enough difference in our ages, and I have known him all his life, in addition to our being connections if not near relations, so that nobody need have found fault. Not that I pretend for a moment that I could have done what your sister is doing--that is something quite wonderful in every respect\" (and here Miss Franklin did draw up her bountiful figure, and fix the rather small eyes, sunk a little in her full cheeks, pointedly on Dora). \"I dare say he liked to have her about him to the last, so long as he was sensible of her presence. Men are extraordinary creatures--that I should say that now, oh! my poor dear cousin Tom.\"  After she had recovered from her outburst of grief, and was sipping the tea which Dora had made for her, she turned again to her companion. \"You look like a ghost yourself, Miss Dora. Will you not lie down in your bedroom and trust me? I shall sit here and bring you word the moment I hear that a change has come;\" and at the ill-omened phrase poor Miss Franklin's well-bred, distinct enunciation got all blurred and faltering. In fact she shrank a good deal from the ordeal she was magnanimously proposing for herself. As it happened she had never undergone anything like it before, though she had reached middle age. It was not easy for her to contemplate sitting there all alone through the dreary small hours, knowing that Tom Robinson's spirit--the spirit of the best friend she had ever known--was passing away without word or sign in the adjoining room. It was a relief to her when Dora Millar, looking as if she had been sitting up in turn with every patient in the ward, as pale as a moonbeam and as weak as water, yet shook her head decisively against any suggestion of her retiring to rest.  There was a strong contrast between the couple who were to wait together for death or the morning. Miss Franklin herself might be on the eve of dying--but so long as she lived and went through the mundane process of dressing, she must dress exceedingly well. She was a good, kind woman all the same, and this night she bore a sore heart under her carefully contrived and nicely put on garments.  Poor young Dora, on the contrary, looked all limp and forlorn. The gingham morning-gown she had not changed was huddled on her, and crumpled about her. Her neglected hair was pushed back from her little white face. Annie in her nurse's spotless apron and cap looked a hundred times trimmer, and was altogether a more cheerful object. It was as if the whole world had come to an end for Dora, and she had ceased to notice trifles. Almost the first words Miss Franklin had said to her when the visitor began to recover from the shock she had undergone, were--  \"Excuse me, Miss Dora, the lace at your throat is coming undone--let me put it right for you; and an end of your hair has fallen down. I may fasten it up, may I not?\"  A delicate, exhausted girl was no great support for a woman under the circumstances, still she was better than nobody. She was company in one form, like the domestic cat, when no more available associate is to be found. Besides, in the middle of their dissimilarity, Miss Franklin had a natural liking for Dora Millar, and had always excepted her from the grudge which the elder woman was inclined to feel against one member of the Millar family. \"A nice, well-meaning, gentle girl,\" Miss Franklin mentally classed Dora. \"The most quiet and ladylike of them all.\" She was a great improvement, in Miss Franklin's estimation, on that too bright and restless Annie, whom everybody cried up as a beauty. She had found, Miss Franklin was creditably informed, a fine vent for her dictatorial imperious temper as a nurse. Yet she, Miss Franklin, ought not to find fault with Annie Millar at this time, when Dr. Capes had said her treatment of the fever patients, with dear Tom among them, was admirable; though, by one of the mysterious decrees of Providence, she might not be permitted to succeed in his case. And she was now ministering to his last wants as she, Barbara Franklin, arrived at mature age, with all the will, had neither the skill nor the courage to minister, much as she owed him, so long as he had other service. She was a captious, vindictive wretch to pick holes in Miss Millar's armour, when she was striving so hard to atone to him for any injury she had ever done him by delivering him from the jaws of death, or at least smoothing his path to the grave.  The seasons had gone on till the late summer was merging into the early autumn. It was the beginning of August, when the days are already not so long as they have been; but, to make up for it, the lengthening nights are balmier than they ever were, and the soft dusk remains full of summer scents and sounds.  It was on such a night that you might imagine a young man, dying long before his time, and yet after he has reached full manhood, and touched the crown of bodily and mental vigour, without ever feeling the tide on its turn.  The night was so warm that the windows of the room in which Dora and Miss Franklin sat were wide open. There was a lamp lit within, but it did not render the darkness without so great as to hide the outlines of trees in the nearest garden, and even the dim shape of a bed of late flowering, tall white lilies. Their heavy fragrance was on the air; and if ever there is a fragrance which is solemn and tender like the love of the dying and the memory of the dead, it is the all-pervading scent of lilies.  Annie Millar could never have been so good a listener as Dora was when Miss Franklin, constitutionally loquacious, relieved her distress, and got rid of the dragging hours, by indulging in a long and affectionate oration on Tom Robinson, the man who, not so many yards from them, was lying as indifferent to praise and blame as when he first entered this wonderful world, with all its joys and sorrows, from which he was ready to depart.  \"You know, he is not really my cousin,\" the womanly confidence began; \"the tie between us hardly counts--it is only that Mr. Robinson's first wife was my mother's sister. But I always called Mr. Charles Robinson and his second wife uncle and aunt. I might well do it, for they were a good uncle and aunt to me. I should have known few pleasures when I was growing up, and long afterwards, if it had not been for them. The Robinsons used to go away trips every summer to Devonshire and Derbyshire, the Yorkshire moors, the Cumberland lakes, Scotland, the Black Forest, Switzerland, and they always took me to see the world, and spend my summer holidays with them. How generous and kind they were in their friendliness! Tom was usually of the party--first as a child, then as a growing boy; but child or boy, such a nice manly little fellow, so much thought of, yet not at all spoilt. He was fond of reading, yet full of quiet fun, and in either light never in anybody's way. He was so considerate of his mother and me, and so helpful to us. The cows he has driven away! the horses going at large he has kept off! the bulls he has held at bay! I confess I am not brave in proportion to my size. I am very timid in such matters, and, strange to say, Aunt Robinson, though a country-woman born and bred, was as great a coward as I where farm animals were in question; but we always knew ourselves safe when Tom was at hand, and he never laughed at us more than we could stand.\"  \"I can understand,\" said Dora faintly. \"He once helped us--May and me--when a strange dog attacked Tray; and now Tray is running about with May full of life and health, while his champion is----\" She could not say the words.  Miss Franklin looked at her approvingly, even went so far as to stroke one of the cold trembling hands lying nerveless in Dora's lap. \"You will allow me to say that you are a dear, tender-hearted girl, Miss Dora. You could have appreciated my cousin Tom. What a tower of strength he was to me when I felt I was getting middle-aged, and my system of teaching was becoming old-fashioned. I had been in so many homes belonging to other people, with never a home of my own, for upwards of thirty years, since my poor father and mother both died before I was twenty. I do not say that I was not for the most part well enough treated, because I hope I did my best, and I believe I generally gave satisfaction. I had my happy hours like other people. But it was all getting so stale, flat, and unprofitable--I suppose because I was growing weary of it all, and longing for a change. You see I had not quite come to the age when we cease to want changes, and are resigned just to go on as we are to the end. In reality I could see no end, except the poorest of poor lodgings and the most pinching straits, with the very little money I had saved. (My dear, even finishing governesses can save so little now-a-days.) Or perhaps there was the chance of my being taken into some charitable institution. You will admit it was not a cheerful prospect.\"  \"No, it was not,\" said Dora, in dreary abstraction.  \"As I said,\" resumed Miss Franklin, \"I had been in so many schoolrooms; I had seen so many pupils grow up, go out into the world, and settle in life, leaving me behind, so that when they came back on visits to their old homes, they were prepared to pity and patronize me. I could not continue cudgelling my poor brains until I had not an original thought in my head, and all to keep up such acquirements as I had, and preserve a place among younger, better equipped girls, certain to outstrip me eventually.\"  \"I suppose so,\" acquiesced Dora mechanically.  \"Then poor dear Tom came to see me, and I told him what I was thinking. He got me to pay a visit to Redcross, and made a new opening for me. I may say without self-conceit that I was always considered to have a good taste in dress. I know it was a question which had never failed to interest me, to which I could not help giving a great deal of attention--making a study of it, as it were. Tom insisted that I could be of the greatest use to him, and was worth a liberal salary, which I was not likely to lose. And there was a comfortable refined nest, which I could line for myself, awaiting me in the pleasant rooms he had looked out for me.\"  \"I know, Miss Franklin,\" said Dora, with a faint smile; \"you told Phyllis Carey, and she told May, who repeated it to me. But I thought it might be a relief to you to speak of it again.\"  \"Yes,\" cried the eager woman; \"and it has all answered so well--the duties not too heavy, and really agreeable to me; the young women and men, under Tom's influence, no doubt, perfectly nice and respectful; and within the last six months, dear little Phyllis like a daughter or niece to me. I thought always I should be able to do something in return for him one day, yet with all the will in the world I have been able to do nothing until it has come to this;\" and poor Miss Franklin sobbed bitterly under the burden of her unrequited obligations, and beneath the dove's neck cluster of feathers in her bonnet.  It was for Dora in her turn to seek to soothe and compose her companion. \"I am sure you have been of the greatest service to him, and that he has enjoyed the near neighbourhood of an old friend--his mother's friend. Oh! think what a comfort it will be to you to have that to look back upon,\" finished Dora, in a voice trembling as much as Miss Franklin's.  Miss Franklin sat up, instinctively put her bonnet straight, wiped her eyes with her embroidered handkerchief, and gazed pensively into the empty air.  \"God's ways are not as our ways,\" she said; \"and certainly we are told that we are not to look for our reward in this world. Still one would have expected--one would have liked that it had not been so hard all through for Tom--not merely to have been denied the desire of his heart, but to have had to endure in his last moments to be set aside, to lie still and look on at what is going to happen.\"  Dora sat mystified; but she had not the spirit left to seek an explanation.  Miss Franklin was not aware that an explanation was needed. \"I know,\" she added, \"how kind and attentive your sister has been to Tom, and I understand nothing can exceed the interest Dr. Ironside has taken in my cousin, while he has made the most unremitting efforts to save him; still you will grant that so long as my poor Tom was conscious, it must have been very, very trying for him to see the terms these two were on. I don't listen much to gossip\"--the speaker declared, in a parenthesis, with a little air of dignity and reserve even at that moment--\"but it is the talk of the town that he has followed her down from London, and that they are to be married as soon as the epidemic is past. Nobody can say anything against it. They are well matched. They will be a fine-looking couple,\" she struggled to acknowledge with becoming politeness and impartiality.  \"This is the first time I have heard of it, I can say with truth,\" said Dora wearily, without so much as a smile at the characteristic report. She thought the mention of it most unsuitable at such a season. The very word marriage smote her. \"And even if it were so, what could it have signified to Mr. Tom Robinson?\" she was about to add navely, when a light flashed upon her. She had often wondered how much Miss Franklin, \"Robinson's,\" the whole town, knew of what had taken place eighteen months ago. She saw now that however little the lady might care for gossip, a distorted version of the truth in which she was interested had reached her. Either there had been a very natural mistake on the part of some of the local newsmongers, or Miss Franklin herself had fallen into the error. The belle of the Millar family and not Dora had been believed to be the object of Tom Robinson's pursuit. The blunder had been perpetuated in Miss Franklin's case by the good feeling and good breeding which would keep her from discussing Tom Robinson's affairs with her neighbours more than she could help, and would prevent her attempting such a cross-examination of the man himself as might have elicited the truth.  \"Oh! I know now what you mean,\" cried Dora, on the impulse of the moment, \"and you were altogether wrong. He has been spared such misery --nobody could have been so barbarous as to inflict it on him, if it had been as you suppose.\"  Miss Franklin was sensitive and imaginative on dress, but she was not imaginative or even very observant with regard to anything else. She understood Dora's protest to refer to an actual engagement between Dr. Harry Ironside and Miss Millar.  \"Well, well,\" she said a little dryly, \"people do exaggerate. Matters may not have gone quite so far, and I can only trust that he, Tom, has not been sensible of what is in the air, though I have always understood love, while it is said to be blind in one sense, is very sharp-sighted in another. I believe every one else sees where the land lies. I saw it myself so far as the gentleman was concerned--he could not keep his eyes off her, though I was not five minutes in their company, and I was full of my poor cousin Tom. I am sure I hope they may be happy,\" gulping down the hope. \"Tom would have wished it, quite apart from her having done her duty by him, at the cost of some pain to herself, no doubt; while Dr. Ironside has been more than kind, which nobody had any call to expect. He must be a very fine young man, likely to win what he fancies. Every woman is entitled to her choice, and most people would applaud your sister's choice. The thing that puzzles me--you will forgive me for mentioning it just this once, for where is the good of discussion now?--is that as, I have been told, she did not meet Dr. Ironside till she went to her London hospital, how, when she had got no opportunity of contrasting the two men, when she had not even seen one of them, she could yet be so set against Tom's proposal, knowing him to be the man he is--was, alas! I should say. Why was she so very hard to poor Tom?\"  \"Oh, don't say that,\" besought Dora, in much agitation. \"Don't bring that forward at this moment.\"  But Miss Franklin, in the strength of her family affections, felt that she owed it to the manes of Tom Robinson to express to the disdainful damsel's sister a candid opinion that he had been summarily and severely dealt with. \"I was not in his confidence, but I could tell that something was going to happen, and that he was very much cut up when it all came to nothing.\"  \"Oh, don't say that,\" repeated Dora, clasping her hands over her eyes, and weeping behind them. \"What good can it do except to inflict needless torture?\"  \"I don't mean to reproach _you_,\" said Miss Franklin, a little bewildered, but still very hot and sore. \"You had nothing to do with it, and I am sure you could not have been so heartless. Forgive me for the reflection on your sister, who is so much thought of, whom everybody is praising, with reason, for what she has done in nursing the sick and poor. But young girls ought to be more careful. I don't mean to say that she trifled with my cousin Tom--I have no right to say that--simply that she never gave him a thought. Tom was surely deserving of a thought,\" cried Miss Franklin indignantly. \"Dr. Ironside may be all very well--I have nothing to say against him--quite the reverse. Tom is not to be compared to him in personal appearance, and the one is a professional man, while the other thought fit to continue a linen-draper like his good father before him; but that is by no means to infer that Miss Millar has chosen the better husband of the two. Girls are so foolish--they play with fire, and never look or take it into account where and whom it may burn. Tom Robinson deserved more respectful treatment in Redcross. He has never been like himself since. I used to hear him whistling and humming tunes to himself as he worked in the office--there is no more of that, or of his hearty interest in everything.\"  \"Miss Franklin, it is you who are pitiless to say this to me to-night,\" panted Dora, rising against the inhumanity, and totally forgetting that the speaker did not hold the clue which would have told her how her words scourged her listener.  \"I am not blaming _you_, Miss Dora,\" said the accuser again, more bitterly than she had yet spoken. For she was in her heart accusing Dora Millar of affectation in pretending not to be able to hear a word against her sister, and in declining to listen to the pardonable utterance of a reproach directed against what Miss Franklin called in her heart Annie Millar's arrogance and callousness. Tom Robinson's cousin was provoked, not pacified.  \"I dare say Tom would never have had this wretched fever but for the blow he got then,\" she was tempted to persist; \"or if he had caught it, he would have thrown it off without any harm done. I can bear witness to his sound constitution to begin with. Everybody knows how disappointment and mortification lower the system, and he was never over careful of himself. I cannot quite understand why he took the cool rebuff he received so much to heart; but he did so, and you see the consequence.\"  \"Spare me! spare me!\" cried Dora passionately. \"Don't say I have killed him, or I shall die myself, perhaps it is the best thing I can do.\"  Before Miss Franklin could do more than stare aghast, with a horrified inkling of the real facts of the case, and the tremendous mess she had got into, there was the sound of the soft opening of a door in the near distance, and a step rapidly approaching.  The two women who had been upbraiding each other were mute in an instant, first held their breaths, then sprang up and clung to each other, partners in sorrow, with teeth beginning to chatter, and eyes to grow large and wild. What had they been doing in the name of a gentle and manly soul, in the face of the awful news on its way, the majesty of Death investing the house?  It was only Annie, looking perfectly collected, nay, a trifle elated. \"He is the least shade better--we both think so; and the slightest improvement means so much at this stage--the right crisis, I believe. He has been really sleeping. He swallows with less difficulty. He has roused himself ever so little, but he is fearfully faint and weak. We cannot get him to take more stimulants than we have been giving him. I am afraid there is no toilet-vinegar in the house. I came to see if either of you had a smelling-bottle, which might revive him.\"  All that Miss Franklin could do was to shake her head. She was so thankful, yet she felt so guilty, so ashamed of herself.  Dora fumbled nervously in her pocket and gave Annie something, which she carried off in triumph. Miss Franklin sat down again and cried afresh between trembling joy and lively vexation. \"Oh, won't it be a mercy, for which we can never praise our Maker too much, if dear Tom gets over his illness after all?\" she managed to say; but she could do no more--even that lame speech was made awkwardly. To apologize for the heinous offence she had committed would be a greater enormity than the offence itself.  But when Miss Franklin had time to think it over afterwards, she was under the impression that Dora Millar had forgotten all about their altercation. She sat there with hands clasped, lips parted, and brimming eyes half raised to Heaven, as if in instinctive acknowledgment of a thousand piteous prayers in the act of being answered by Him who counts the stars and calls them by name, and heals the broken in heart. Miss Franklin's account of Dora's look was that, for a moment, she was positively frightened at the dear girl, Dora seemed so near another world at that moment, and as likely as not to be holding communication with it. Even Tom Robinson could not have been nearer when he was more than half way across the border-land.     CHAPTER XXII.  A SHRED OF HOPE.   Tom Robinson's recovery continued a matter of fear and trembling for a week longer before it became merely a process of time. But no sooner was it clearly established to the initiated, and only likely to be endangered by some unforeseen accident, than Annie Millar, in her delight, lost sight of her former tactics, and called on Dr. Harry Ironside to rejoice with her on their success.  \"We have been permitted to pull him through. Oh, isn't it glorious? I know we ought, as we are miserable sinners, to go down on our knees and give God the thanks, and I hope we do with all my heart; but I also want to sing and dance--don't you, Dr. Ironside?\"  Nobody could imagine that Dr. Harry Ironside was indifferent to the wonderful recovery, which was such a credit to his skill, of the man whom he had nursed as if Tom Robinson had been his brother; but Dr. Harry forgot all about his patient at that moment when he saw his opportunity and seized it.  He had never had a faint heart, young as he was, but he had been dealing with an exceedingly coy and high-spirited mistress. However, even she had not been able to defy the effect of the last month of incessant intercourse, of being engrossed in common with one object of interest, when both had hung, as it were, on a man's failing breath, and were indissolubly linked while it lasted. In the light of its fitful rising and falling, its feeble fluttering, the terrible moments when it appeared to stop and die away, how small and vain was every other consideration! But their joint work was done by God's help, as they had hardly dared to hope for a time, and now it was Harry's innings.  \"I have something to say to you, Miss Millar. I have wished to say it for a long time. You will not refuse to hear me?\"  They were alone together in the little side-room, empty but for its hospital stores, where they had so often consulted, with and without Dr. Capes, on the condition of the ward. There was no longer any fluster of doubt and hesitation in his manner. He stood there in his young comely manhood, prepared to put his fate to the test, claiming his right to do so, and challenging her to deny his claim.  In a moment Annie saw what Rose had seen some time ago, but had not taken it upon her to put in so many words for Annie's benefit. It was of this moment she had, by an unerring instinct, stood in mortal terror, from the first dawn of her acquaintance with Harry Ironside, to the afternoon when he had succeeded in getting an introduction to her in the matron's room at St. Ebbe's, soon after the scene in the operating theatre. Then he had bowed low, muttered a few words in confused greeting, and looked at her with all his man's heart in his eyes; and she had felt by a sure, swift intuition, that, as she valued her dearly held personal freedom and her allegiance to her family, there must be war to the knife between her and this self-willed young man. She must, as discretion is the better part of valour, flee from him, while refusing to own, even to herself, any more humiliating reason for the flight than her duty, the honour of St. Ebbe's, and the folly of Rose in playing into his hands.  Now Annie was caught, and had to listen to him whether she would or not, while she and not he quaked with fright and agitation. For he stood before her, like a conqueror already, in the little room with its shelves of phials, which they had all to themselves, where burly farmers and iron-gray corn-factors would soon be thronging in the course of transacting their every-day business.  But presently she forgot all about herself in the interest of the tale he had to tell, and told well in his newly-found courage and coolness, in his personal modesty and professional enthusiasm. He had just taken his degree as she knew. He and his sister Kate had inherited a competence from their parents. He might look about him till he found a lucrative and agreeable country practice in a choice neighbourhood, where he could command good society and a little hunting, shooting, and fishing in their seasons. Or he might be on the watch for a West End London practice, which, while affording him all the interests and amusements of town, ought to bring him speedily into notice, and raise him, step by step, to the height of his profession. He had begun his medical career by thinking of both these eventualities as desirable, each in its kind, and had gone on cherishing a leaning to the first, till--he must say it--her example and influence had inspired him with greater ardour in the cause of science and of humanity. He had made inquiries and had heard of a post--in fact he had got the refusing of it--in connection with a new settlement, a fresh attempt to plant a colony where the climate was favourable on one of the great African rivers. His income at first would be small, and he must take his share of the hardships and labours of those who aimed at being more than gold-diggers or miners in the diamond-fields--that is, pioneers of civilization. The prospect, so far as it referred to scientific investigations, and to a large increase to accredited stores of knowledge, was simply splendid. Farther, he was assured of the sympathy and support of the leading men among the colonists, since they had already, to their credit, sought his co-operation. Those of them who were in the van--on the spot--had gone so far as to lay the foundation of an hospital, in addition to a church, to deal alike with black men and white, to labour for their spiritual and physical healing in common. He had almost made up his mind to take the post, but he wished to ask her opinion and advice first.  She was tempted to say she was no authority, but her truthfulness forbade the subterfuge. She could not meet his grave blue eyes and put him off with an evasive answer. She spoke bravely and wisely.  \"I think it would be most right and honourable for you to go. With your ability and training you might furnish invaluable aid to a young colony; while it would be like another college course for you, with nature for your teacher. Any young man of spirit and philanthropy, with love for his calling, might well covet the chance. If the colony flourish, you and your profession, and the hospital you speak of, will flourish with it, and have as fine a future before you as you can desire. If the scheme fail, you can but return to England; and you will not have lost the time which a young man can well spare. For you will bring back all you have gained from a far wider sphere of usefulness, and from a fresher experience than you could ever hope to secure by staying at home. But if what you really want,\" Annie corrected herself, with a twinkle in her eyes and a curl of her lips, in the midst of her earnestness, \"is the shortest and safest road to growing well-to-do within the briefest space of time, you had better adopt the latter alternative. If I had been a man and a doctor, I should have tried the former.\"  \"That is enough,\" he said with conviction.  \"But what will your sister say?\" she hastened to inquire, in order to turn the conversation from ominous personalities.  \"Oh! it will be a blow to poor little Kate,\" he owned regretfully, \"because she is too young to go out with me at once, and set about keeping house for me as she has always proposed--a rough, primitive style of housekeeping it will be out there for many a day. But she is not without pluck, and she is as true as steel, though I say it. She must learn some of your fearlessness and faith, and make the best of things. She must go to one of our aunts in the meantime, and when matters are smoother and easier, and the fate of the colony is decided, perhaps she may join me. I do not believe that there is any danger to speak of from the native tribes, only it will not be drawing-room work for some time to come. You see it is not the same with a girl like Kate as it would be with a woman like you,\" he had the boldness to insinuate. \"You would be a tower of strength in yourself from the beginning; you might be the making of a newly-founded hospital.\"  \"Poor Kate!\" said Annie, hastily apostrophizing the girl she had been said to ignore, and speaking in accents of far deeper pity than she had any idea of.  \"And what do you say?\" he turned upon her.  \"I?\" she cried in much confusion. \"I have said my say.\"  \"No,\" he answered; \"unless you mean to send me away to the ends of the earth without a shred of hope. You cannot do that.\"  \"I think you are taking advantage of me,\" she protested, but quite meekly and diffidently for Annie. \"I have never been even civil to you till Tom Robinson was in danger, and then I had to put all my private feelings aside on his account. Before that I was more than rude.\"  \"And you are a little sorry now? Confess it, Annie, when I am going off all alone, so far as old friends are concerned, to Central Africa, at your bidding.\"  \"Not at my bidding,\" she declared hastily; \"it is too bad of you to say so.\"  \"And you are going to be far kinder in the end than in the beginning,\" he persisted. \"You are going to say, 'Harry Ironside, if you ever come back, whether it is to stay or to go out again to your colony, you will find me waiting for you as your earthly reward.'\"  \"Of course you will come back,\" she exclaimed vehemently, thrown off her guard; \"but _you_ had much better wait and look out for some more gracious person to welcome you.\"  \"I don't care for gracious persons,\" said the foolish fellow scornfully; \"that is, for persons who are always gracious whether they like or dislike their company. But I say,\" he went on, in an eager boyish way, which was not unbecoming or inharmonious where his young manhood was concerned, only natural and pleasant, \"I should care for the best and brightest and bonniest woman in the world being gracious to me; I would give much to make her like me, though I know I am far behind her in cleverness and goodness.\"  \"Nonsense,\" cried Annie, quite testily. \"I shall be used up in hospital service by that time,\" she remonstrated, keeping to the far future. \"A faded woman with a sharp tongue would not be a great reward.\"  \"I ask nothing better than a woman whom I could love, and who might love me.\"  \"But you deserve something better,\" she said, in a softer, lower tone.  \"Never mind what I deserve, if I get what I have wished, longed, and prayed for since the first moment I saw you--think of that, Annie.\"  \"I can't,\" she said, almost piteously, while she suffered him to take her hand. \"I meant it all to be so different. I was so proud of my independence; and I never, never will forfeit it, remember, Harry Ironside, till all my sisters are started in the world, and father and mother are made more comfortable. Oh! it would be doubly a shame in me to fail them.\"  \"I am content to wait for my prize,\" he said, daring to kiss her lovely cheek, and he was content--for the moment.  \"And you must not breathe a word of what has happened,\" she charged him.  But here he grew restive. \"I must, dearest. Why, it would be doubly dishonourable not to speak at once to Dr. Millar, confined as he is to his chair; you cannot fail to see that.\"  \"They will all laugh at me,\" sighed the subdued Annie, with comical ruefulness. \"Rose will laugh, and May. I believe even Dora and mother will laugh.\"  \"Let them.\" He gave the permission with cheerful insensibility to the ordeal, even though Annie's feelings were so much involved in it. \"It may be a warning to some of them.\" Then he was so callous as to add, \"Who cares though the whole world, including Tom Robinson, were to join in the guffaw.\"  \"Oh!\" she exclaimed, looking up with bright sweetness, \"I think I could bear it if I heard Tom's voice in the chorus. He used to have rather a foolish, nervous laugh, for so sensible and brave a man. But I am sure I should not think it foolish, or anything save delightful, if I heard it again.\"     CHAPTER XXIII.  SECOND THOUGHTS AND LAST WORDS.   Dr. and Mrs. Millar could make no objection to Dr. Harry Ironside as a suitor for their daughter. It was all the other way. They were highly satisfied with the young man's antecedents and credentials, and yet Dr. Millar was a good deal taken aback. He had grown to look on nursing as a career for Annie, and to take pride in her excellence in it, as he would have done had she been his son and a young doctor. He could not help feeling as if marriage interfered a little with his views for her. He had to recall that Ironside was a very fine young fellow, with a commendable spirit of inquiry in medical matters. He would do credit to his profession, and Annie, especially if she went with him to a new colony, might work in his company, and be his right hand.  Mrs. Millar had too much good sense and womanly experience to approve of long engagements, and she did not like the chance of Annie's going to Africa--still she would fulfil what Mrs. Millar considered the highest and happiest destiny for a woman, that of becoming the wife of a worthy man. As to Africa, the little Doctor, a fixture in his chair, told her, \"My dear Maria, we shall simply be giving hostages to Providence, for man was told to occupy the earth, and carry civilization and redemption to its utmost bounds.\"  To spare Annie's feelings, her relations kept her engagement and their laughter well in the background, while Dr. Harry Ironside, having probed the Russian fever to the bottom, and seen nearly the last of it, returned in triumph to London, to make arrangements for his medical mission.  As for Annie, in her eagerness to escape from the rallying she had provoked, she talked incessantly about going back to St. Ebbe's, where, however, she was not yet due. A longer leave of absence had been granted to her, in consideration of the fact that her holiday had been mainly spent in hard work in the impromptu hospital at Redcross. She would not have accepted the additional grant apart from the circumstance that Harry Ironside was in London. Annie admitted to herself, in the secret recesses of her heart, that now it had come to this, she would fain have passed these last precious weeks near her young lover. But she would not consent to give occasion to Rose, or any other person--not even to Harry Ironside himself--to think or say that she, Annie Millar, was already not able to live without him. Annie's wings might be clipped, but she would be Annie proud and \"plucky\" to the last; and her lover, instinctively knowing her to be true as steel, loved her the better because of her regard for what she considered his credit as well as her own. The pride was only skin deep; the pluck was part of the heroic element in Annie.  Rose had been delayed in her work. She had not found it in her heart to walk about taking sketches when the good friend who had so much to do with the commission was little likely to see its completion. But when Tom Robinson could sit up, walk into the next room, and go back to his own house, she felt at liberty to set about her delightful business, in which her father took so keen an interest. She lost no time in starting every fine day in pursuit of the selected views, to put them on canvas while their autumnal hues were still but tinges of red, russet, and gold.  Rose was mostly waited on by May, who took much satisfaction in helping to carry and set up the artist's apparatus, feeling, as she said, that she was part of a painter when she did so.  Dora had been with Rose, May, and Tray at a pretty reach of the Dewes. The elder sister was returning alone, along the path between the elms by the river, near the place where Tom Robinson had come to Tray's rescue, when she met him face to face. He was taking what \"constitutional\" he was able for, and enjoying the light breeze which was rippling the river, just as it rippled the ripe corn and fanned the hot brows of the men who were working the corn machine in the field beyond.  Dora had seen and spoken to him several times since his illness, but there had been other people present, and now the old shy dread of a _tte--tte_ again took possession of her. She would have contented herself with a fluttered inquiry after his health, and a faltering remark that she ought not to detain him. She would have hurried on, as if the errand on which she was bound demanded the utmost speed, supremely wretched while she did so, to notice how pale and worn he still looked when she saw him in the broad sunshine. She would have mourned over the circumstance that he wore no wrap, though there was always some damp by the river, and speculated in despondency whether it could be right for him, while he still looked so ill, to be walking thus by himself? What would happen if faintness overtook him, and he could not accomplish the distance between him and the town?  Tom Robinson, delicate though he looked, quiet as he was, would not let Dora have her way. He turned and walked back with her, which ought to have set one of her fears at rest. And his appearance must have belied him, for he was clearly in excellent spirits, with not the most distant intention of being overcome by faintness.  \"This is very pleasant,\" he said, with a smile, and his smile was a peculiarly agreeable one.  Dora could not tell whether he meant the day, or the road, or her company, or even her summer dress, which was fresher and better cared for than when he had encountered the family group \"place-hunting\" in London. Dora had owned more leisure lately, and, absurd as it might sound, her heart had been singing with joy, so that she could not resist making her dress in keeping with the gladness of her spirit. Her little fingers had been cleverer than they had ever shown themselves before in the manufacture of a frock and the trimming of a hat which would not have disgraced the taste and execution of Miss Franklin. Yet the materials were simple and inexpensive to the last degree--a brown holland and a shady brown hat, and about the frock and the hat some old Indian silk which in its mellowed gorgeousness of red and maize colours softly reflected the hues of Rose's parrot tulips.  Dora did not dare to ask her companion what he thought so pleasant. It seemed right to take it for granted that it was the weather, so she answered quickly, Yes, it was a fine day for the harvest, which she believed was going to be a good one this year.  \"Our present encounter is more tranquil than our last, near this very spot,\" he went on, still smiling. \"Perhaps it is as well that there are no disturbing elements of collies and terriers on the scene, for though I am getting on famously, I am not sure that I am up to the mark of dragging Tray and a giant assailant to the edge of the bank, and pitching them head-foremost into the water.\"  \"I should think not,\" said Dora briefly.  \"How 'little May' screamed, and you stood, as white as a sheet, valorously aiming your stone.\"  \"We were great cowards, both of us,\" admitted Dora, smiling too; \"and I am thankful to say Tray has been much better behaved since he was at the veterinary surgeon's.\"  \"There was room for improvement,\" Tom Robinson said, with the gravity of a judge.  \"I left him on in front, begging to May for a bit of chalk.\"  \"It is as well that it was not for a bit of beef,\" he said. Then he suddenly changed the subject. \"Do you know that I have something of yours which has come into my hands that I have been wishing to give back to you ever since I was a responsible being again?\"  As he spoke, he unfastened for the second time in their acquaintance the tiny vinaigrette case from his watch-chain, and handed it to her.  Dora flushed scarlet, and took it without a word.  \"I got it one night in the course of that fever, when I was at the worst, and I know you will like to hear that I am sure it did me good. The first thing that I recollect after a long blank, which lasted for days, I believe, was feebly fingering and sniffing at the little box, with a curious agreeable sense of old association. Then I was able to look at it, and recognize it as my mother's vinaigrette. She had let me play with it when I was a child; and when I was a boy, subject to headache from staying too long in the hot sunshine in the cricket-field, she used to lend me her vinaigrette for a cure. But I knew that I had asked you to have it, and that you had done me the favour to accept it. The fascinating puzzle was, how had it come back to me? At last I questioned Barbara Franklin. She could not tell any more than myself at first, and was equally puzzled, until she remembered your sister Annie's running into the room on the night when you were listening for news of my death, and asking for a smelling-bottle, and your fumbling for an instant in your pocket, and giving her something. That made it perfectly plain.\"  Too plain, Dora reflected in horror, for what might not Miss Franklin have suspected and communicated in addition to her cousin?  \"I was glad I had it in my pocket,\" said Dora, stammering. \"I took it up to London with me, and--and found it often refreshing in the middle of the heat and fatigue. I am thankful to hear it was of use to you, who have the best right to it.\"  \"No,\" he said emphatically, \"though it was of the greatest use. My cousin Barbara said also that you were very sorry for me. Dora, was that so?\" Tom himself blushed a little in asking the question, as if he had a guilty consciousness of having taken rather a mean advantage of Dora Millar, first by coming so near to death without actually dying, and then by listening to what his kinswoman had to say of Miss Dora Millar's state of mind at the crisis.  On Dora's part there was no denying such a manifest truth; she could only utter a tremulous \"yes,\" and turn her head aside.  \"That was good of you, though I do not know that I am repaying the goodness properly,\" he said, with another smile, very wistful this time. \"For I must add, that hearing of it tempted me to wonder once again whether you could ever learn to think of me? If you cannot, just say no, and I'll cease from this moment to tease you\" (as if he had been doing nothing else save besiege and pester her for the last year and a half!).  Dora could not say \"no\" any more than she could say \"yes\" straight out, though she was certain that to be kept any longer than was absolutely necessary in a state of acute suspense was very bad for him in his weakened health. By a great effort she brought herself to say in little breaks and gasps, \"I do not need to learn, Mr. Tom, because I have thought of you for a long time now--long before you were so good and generous to all of us--almost ever since you wished--you asked--what I was so silly and so ungrateful as to refuse.\"  He drew her hand through his arm and held it tightly; he could not trust himself to say or do more. He was almost as shy as she was in the revulsion of his great happiness.  She struggled conscientiously to continue her confession. \"I had thought hardly at all of you before then. Girls are so full of themselves, and I did not know that you wished me to think of you. I seem to see now that if you had given me more time, and let me grow familiar with the idea, even though we were 'donkeys,' as Annie and Rose say, and though we were choke-full of youthful folly----\" She stopped short without finishing her sentence, or going farther into the nature of what she seemed to see.  \"But I besought you to take time, Dora, love,\" he remonstrated. \"You forget, I urged you to let me wait for the chance of your answer's being different.\" He could not help, even in the hour of the attainment of the dearest wish of his heart, being just to his old modest, reasonable self.  \"Yes,\" she said, with the prettiest, faintest, arch smile hovering about the corners of her mouth. \"But men ought to be wiser than to take simple girls at their first word, which the girls can never, never unsay, unless the men bid them. Now I'll tell you how malicious people will view the present situation. They will say that I refused you point blank when I thought we were well off, then got you to propose again, and graciously accepted the proposal, when I knew we had not a penny in the world. I own it looks very like it, and it is partly your fault; you should not have let me go the first time. But I don't care what people say, so long as there is not a word of truth in it.\"  \"Nor I,\" said Tom undauntedly. \"They may also say that I was able to make myself useful to your family, and like a very tradesman, traded on the usefulness, buying a reluctant bride with it. But what do we care when we love each other, and God has given us to each other? 'They say,'--what do they say? Let them say.\"  There was not the shadow of a cloud the size of a man's hand on Dr. and Mrs. Millar's pleasure in their daughter Dora's marriage to Tom Robinson. For instead of going with Annie to Africa, or starting on a mission of her own to bring May's college fees from Jamaica, Dora remained at Redcross to be Tom Robinson's dear wife and cherished darling. Mrs. Millar had long seen, in her turn, that Dora could not do better. The fine old shop, and the fantastic shade of poor Aunt Penny, had both become of no account. The single thing which troubled Mrs. Millar was that the instant Lady Mary Pemberton heard of the wedding in prospect, she invited herself to come down to it.  Dora's sisters, with the charming inconsistency of young women, were not only acquiescent in her undignified fate--they were jubilant over it.  It did not arrest, though it subdued the general congratulations, when it was discovered that the event made Harry Ironside all at once both envious and aggressive. He could not see why, if Dora Millar were marrying a rich man, and he himself had a sufficient income not merely to make a satisfactory settlement on his wife, but to do his part in helping her relatives, who would also be his from the day he married her, that his marriage should not take place as soon as Dora and Tom Robinson's. In place of an indefinite engagement, with thousands of miles of land and sea, and all the uncertainties of life into the bargain, between him, Harry Ironside, and Annie Millar, would it not be much better that he should carry away with him the brightest, bravest woman who ever asked little from a new colony; who, in place of asking, would give full measure and running over? For Annie was not like poor dear little Kate--Annie would be a godsend, even though she had to go the length of learning to fire a revolver as a defence against lions and hostile natives. It would be nothing else than savage pride in Dr. Millar, Harry continued to argue, to decline to let Tom Robinson defray May's small expenses at St. Ambrose's, whether she won a scholarship or not. He was a man with an ample fortune, as well as the nicest fellow in the world, who was going to be not only May's coach, but her brother-in-law. In like manner it would be downright churlish and positively unkind to Dora if her parents refused to occupy the pleasant small house with the large garden belonging to Tom Robinson, and close to what would be their daughter's house. It was conveniently vacant, and looked as if it had been made for a couple of elderly gentle-folks, who were not rich, but were comfortably provided for. In fact, it had been fitted up by the late Mr. Charles Robinson for just such a pair, who had in the course of nature left the house empty.  With regard to Rose, she would have to submit to be more or less Harry Ironside's charge till she painted and sold such 'stunning' pictures that she could afford to look down on his paltry aid. What, not allow him to assist his own sister-in-law, when he was so thankful to think that she might be like a sister in the meantime for his poor little Kate to fall back upon? Why, the girls could go on making a home together at his good friend Mrs. Jennings's, till it was right for Kate, after she was old enough to choose, to cast in her lot with him and Annie, supposing the colony prospered. His heart was already in that strange, far-away region, which, with all its mysteries and wonders--ay, and its terrors--has such an attraction for the young and high-spirited, the typical pilgrims to a later New England.  And what did Annie think of this march stolen upon her, this attempt to extort a yard where she had only granted an inch of favour? Perhaps she was dazzled by what would have repelled many another woman, in the primitive, precarious, exciting details of the life of a young colony. Perhaps her heart and imagination were alike taken by storm when she thought of the untenanted hospital wards and the patients calling for her to go over and help them. Perhaps she was simply beginning so to identify herself with Harry Ironside that what he did seemed her doing. Anyhow Annie did not say no.  The Miss Dyers remarked oracularly, when the double marriage was announced in Redcross, that it was just what they had expected. The observation was somewhat vague, like other oracles' speeches. The general public of Redcross, including the Careys and Hewetts, were less indefinite and more cordial in their expression of satisfaction at the suitable settlement in life of the little Doctor's elder daughters.  Miss Franklin could not be too thankful and pleased that, after all, she had done no mischief to her cousin Tom by her blunder, and by what had been her only too personal reproaches and revelations addressed to his future wife on the night when he was believed to be lying dying. In fact, if she, Barbara Franklin, had not been conscious of a huge mistake, with all the deplorable consequences it might have carried in its train, if she had not thus been kept shamefacedly humble and silent as to her share in the business, she might have taken credit to herself, with greater reason than Mrs. Jennings could boast, of having united a supremely happy couple who were drifting apart. Even if Miss Franklin's part in it had been played voluntarily and advisedly, she would never have cause to regret that night's work. For Dora Robinson had no scruple in being the fast friend and affectionate cousin of her husband's forewoman. She had no more qualm than she would have felt if Miss Franklin had never condescended to trade, but had remained within the bounds of poor gentility by laboriously keeping up her halting classical music and waning foreign languages, and by continuing a finishing governess to the day of her death--or rather till she was superannuated, and had to retire to a too literal garret.  \"Oh! Jonathan\"--Mrs. Millar could not resist a long-drawn sob on the great day of the double marriage--\"it is all very well to say Annie has got a good husband--a fine disinterested young man, certain to be distinguished in his profession, you tell me. I believe that, and am very thankful for it. How could I bear the parting otherwise? But to let our eldest, our prettiest, and wittiest, with her warm heart and untiring energy--'the flower of the flock,' as people used to call her when the children were young--go out to Africa, it may be to meet unheard-of trials, like your poor Aunt Penny, it may be never to see our faces again----\" Mrs. Millar could say no more.  \"Hush! hush! Maria; you must be reasonable--you must take the bad with the good,\" enjoined the little Doctor from his arm-chair. \"Why, you are making as much commotion as you did when Annie said she would be a nurse. Is an hospital ward at home so preferable to an hospital ward in the dark continent, which is ceasing to be dark? Its sun is only too blazingly bright, its river plains too teemingly fertile, its mountains too grand even in the grander monotony of its deserts. There is gold in its dust, and its rocks are glittering with diamonds. But, thank God, that is not all. It is the great country for which Livingstone was content to spend his life, where the Moffats made the wilderness blossom like the rose, and Colenso won the wild heart of the Zulu to trust him as a brother. You will have Dora and Tom next door to you, and Rose and 'little May' will be constantly coming and going. As for Annie and Harry, how can you tell that their special gifts would not be wasted here, as I have often thought hers would have been if she had continued only a pretty, sprightly young lady, and not grown up into an hospital nurse!\"  \"Perhaps you are right, Jonathan,\" answered his wife meekly, coming round, as she did now more than ever, to his side of the question.  \"Do you think Sir John Richardson's daughter, Bishop Selwyn's wife, missed the highest calling she was capable of when, instead of presiding over a pleasant country-house or a fine London drawing-room, she consented with all her heart to be landed on an island in Melanesia, and left among the native converts to help to prepare the Malay girls for confirmation? Her husband was away in the meantime in his missionary yacht on his noble enterprise, ready to take her off the island on his return, and not fearing to trust her in the interval to their God whose work she was doing,\" argued the old man, with a note of something like exultation in his voice. \"Annie and Harry are not going out to Africa, as my Aunt Penny and poor Beauchamp of Waylands went to Australia in the days of the earlier squatters, entirely for their own hand, and because they cannot help themselves, since there is nothing left for them to do here. Our children are going to render gallant service on which their talents are well bestowed, of which we shall always be proud to hear. They are, as I told you before, our hostages in the carrying out of the great purpose of the Almighty Ruler of the universe, by which light is to take the place of darkness, and good of evil, from the rivers even to the ends of the earth.\"   THE END.\n\n"

ON THE \"EOLUS.\"   IT was on one of the cool, brilliant days which early June brings to the Narragansett country, that the steamer \"Eolus\" pushed out from Wickford Pier on her afternoon trip to Newport. The sky was of a beautiful translucent blue; the sunshine had a silvery rather than a golden radiance. A sea-wind blew up the Western Passage, so cool as to make the passengers on the upper deck glad to draw their wraps about them. The low line of the mainland beyond Conanicut and down to Beaver Tail glittered with a sort of clear-cut radiance, and seemed lifted a little above the water. Candace Arden heard the Captain say that he judged, from the look of things, that there was going to be a change of weather before long.  Captain Peleg King was a great favorite on his line of travel. He had a pleasant, shrewd face, grizzled hair, a spare, active figure; and he seemed to notice every one of his passengers and to take an interest in them.  \"Going down to Newport, Miss?\" he said to Candace, after giving her one or two quick looks.  The question was superfluous, for the \"Eolus\" went nowhere else except to Newport; but it was well-meant, for the Captain thought that Candace seemed lonely and ill at ease, and he wished to cheer her.  \"Yes, sir,\" she answered, shyly.  \"Your folks there for the summer?\" he went on.  \"No, sir; I'm going to stay with my cousin Mrs. Gray.\"  \"Mrs. Courtenay Gray you mean, I guess. Well, it's queer, but I sort er thought that you favored her a little. She's down early this year. I fetched her and the family across on my evening trip more'n two weeks ago. Mrs. Gray's a mighty nice lady; I'm always pleased when she comes aboard. Wouldn't you like to take a seat in the wheel-house, Miss? The wind's blowing pretty fresh.\"  Candace was not aware that this was a distinguishing attention which the Captain did not pay everybody, and which she owed partly to her connection with Mrs. Gray and partly to her solitary look, which had touched Captain Peleg's benevolent heart. He had a girl of his own \"over to Wickford,\" who was about the same age; and it made him \"kind of tender\" toward other girls who didn't seem to have any one to look after them. But the wind _was_ fresh, and it was pleasant to be spoken to and noticed by some one on this, the first long journey of her short life; so she thankfully accepted the Captain's invitation, and let him escort her along the deck, and assist her to mount the two steps which led into the wheel-house.  It was rather a pleasant-looking place in which she found herself. Three sides of the little enclosure were lined with windows, through which the green shores, which seemed to be rapidly drifting past them, could be seen. The fourth side was filled with a long cushioned bench. In the middle of the glassed front was the big brass wheel, shining with polish and friction, and revolving artistically in the hands of its steersman, who kept his eye fixed alternately on the water and on his compass. There seemed to be no regulation against speaking to this \"man at the wheel,\" or if there were, it was not strictly regarded; for two young ladies, who were already ensconced in one corner of the long seat, were plying him with all manner of questions.  They were rather pretty girls of that hard modern type which carries the air of knowing everything worth the knowing, having a right to everything worth the having, and being fully determined to claim that right to its fullest extent. As Candace entered, they favored her with one rapid, scrutinizing glance that took in every detail of her apparel, from the goat-skin boots which were too large for her feet to the round hat whose every bow bore witness to a country milliner, and after that they noticed her no more.  She, for her part, only too glad to be left unnoticed, looked shyly out of the corners of her eyes at them. They seemed to her inexpressibly stylish; for their tailor-made suits, though almost as plain as her own dress and jacket of blue alpaca, had that perfect fit and finish which makes the simplest dress seem all that can be desired. There was a knowing look to each little detail, from the slender silver bangles which appeared beneath the loose wrinkled wrists of their very long gloves to the tortoise-shell pins with which their hats were fastened to the tightly braided hair coiled low down on the nape of the neck. Candace's hair fell in curls to her waist. She had always worn it so, and no one had ever thought anything about it; but now, all in a moment, she felt that it was wrong and improper.  \"Been up to New York, Miss Joy?\" said the Captain.  \"No; only as far as the Junction, to meet a friend,\" replied the prettier of the two girls. \"Why weren't you on the boat this morning, Captain?\"  \"I was on the boat. I never miss a trip, except sometimes the night one in the summer-time, when the sleeping-train is a running. I don't always come over in that. Let me see, how did I come to miss you to-day?\"  \"Oh, I sat in the ladies' cabin all the way, not on deck. But I didn't see you when we landed.\"  \"Well, I don't know how it happened, I'm sure. Are your folks down for the season?\"  \"Yes: that is, mamma and I and my brother are here; my married sister won't come till next month.\" Then she turned to her friend, but without lowering her voice.  \"You can't think how dull it's been, Ethel: no men, no dinners; nothing going on as yet. The Casino is only just opened, and people haven't begun to go there. We tried to get up a tennis match, but there weren't enough good players to make it worth while. There's absolutely nothing. Mrs. Courtenay Gray had a girls' lunch on Tuesday; but that is all, and that didn't count for much.\"  \"That's Georgie Gray's mother, isn't it? Is she there?\"  \"Oh, yes,--she and Gertrude, all the Grays. They're as nice and delightful as can be, of course, but somehow they're so literary and quiet, and Mrs. Gray is awfully particular about the girls. She makes them keep on with studying all summer, and she's so exclusive,--she won't let them visit half the new people.\"  \"Gracious! why not?\"  \"Oh, I don't know,--she says they're not good form, and all that; but I'm sure she knows queer people enough herself. There is that tiresome old Miss Gisborne down in Washington Street,--the girls are forever going there; and I've seen them myself ever so many times coming out of the Hares',--and _they_ take boarders!\"  \"Fancy! How extraordinary! Oh, there are the frigates!\"  For the \"Eolus,\" leaving the wooded, wall-like bank of Gould's Island behind, and rounding a point, had now reached the small curving bay to the eastward of Coasters' Harbor, where lay the training-ships, the \"New Hampshire\" and the \"Minnesota.\" It was a beautiful sight,--the two great war-vessels at anchor, with their tall tapering spars and flying flags reflected in the water on which they floated. Lines of glinting white flashed along the decks; for it was \"wash-day,\" and the men's clothes were drying in the sun. Two or three barges were disembarking visitors at the gangway ladders, and beyond them a sail-boat was waiting its turn to do the same. On the pier a file of blue-uniformed boys were marching with measured tread. The sound of their feet came across the distance like the regular beat of a machine. A girl in a row-boat was just pushing out from the farther beach, above which rose a stone house covered with vines.  \"That's Miss Isherwood,\" said one of the young ladies. \"She's a splendid rower, and Tom says she swims as well as he does.\"  The whole scene was like enchantment to Candace, who had lived all her life among the hills of Connecticut, and had never till that day seen the ocean. She was much too shy to ask questions, but she sat like one in a dream, taking in with wide-open eyes all the details of the charming view,--the shores, broken by red-roofed villas and cottages rising from clouds of leafy greenery; the Torpedo Island with its tall flag-staff and floating banner over the dwelling of the Commandant; Fort Adams, whose steep glacis seemed powdered with snow just then from the multitude of daisies in bloom upon them; the light-houses; the soft rises of hill; and beyond, the shimmering heave of the open sea. Cat-boats and yachts flitted past in the fair wind like large white-winged moths; row-boats filled with pleasure-parties dipped their oars in the wake of the \"Eolus;\" steam-launches with screeching whistles were putting into their docks, among old boat-houses and warehouses, painted dull-red, or turned of a blackish gray by years of exposure to weather. Behind rose Newport, with the graceful spire of Trinity Church and the long bulk of the Ocean House surmounting the quaint buildings on the lower hill. The boat was heading toward a wharf, black with carriages, which were evidently drawn up to wait the arrival of the \"Eolus.\"  \"There's Mrs. Gray's team now, Miss,\" said the sharp-eyed Captain; \"come down for you, I reckon.\"  The two girls glanced at her and then at each other. They shrugged their shoulders, and Candace heard one of them whisper,--  \"Did you ever?\" and the reply, \"No; but after all, we didn't say anything very bad, and who would have dreamed that a hat like that had anything to do with the Grays?\"  She felt herself blush painfully. The hat was a new one of brown straw trimmed with dark blue ribbon. She had felt rather proud of it when it came home from the milliner's the day before, and had considered the little blue pompon with which Miss Wilson, who was authority in matters of fashion in North Tolland, had enriched the middle bow, as a masterpiece of decoration. Alas! the apple of knowledge was at her lips; already she felt herself blush at the comments of these unknown girls whose hats were so different from her own, and was thoroughly uncomfortable, though she could hardly have told why.  Captain Peleg politely carried her bag for her across the landing-plank to where the \"team,\" a glossy coup with one horse, was waiting. He beckoned to the smart coachman, who wore a dark green overcoat with big metal buttons, to draw nearer.  \"Here's your passenger,\" he said, helping Candace into the carriage. \"Good-day, Miss. I hope we'll see you again on the 'Eolus.' All right, driver.\"  \"Oh, thank you,\" cried Candace, finding voice and forgetting shyness in her gratitude; \"you've been real kind to me, Captain.\"  \"That child's got mighty pretty eyes,\" soliloquized Captain King, as he marched down the wharf. \"I wonder what relation she is to the Grays. She don't seem their sort exactly. She's been raised in the country, I expect; but Mrs. Gray'll polish her up if anybody can, or I'm mistaken. Steady there--what're you about?\" as a trunk came bounding and ricochetting across the gangway; \"this wharf ain't no skittle-ground!\"  Meanwhile the coup was slowly climbing a steep side-street which led to the Avenue. Looking forth with observant eyes, Candace noted how the houses, which at first were of the last-century build, with hipped roofs and dormer windows like those to which she was accustomed in the old hill village that had been her birthplace, gave way to modernized old houses with recent additions, and then to houses which were unmistakably new, and exhibited all manner of queer peaks and pinnacles and projections, shingled, painted in divers colors, and broken by windows of oddly tinted glass. Next the carriage passed a modern church built of pinkish-brown stone; and immediately after, the equable roll of the wheels showed that they were on a smooth macadamized road. It was, in fact, though Candace did not know it, the famous Bellevue Avenue, which in summer is the favorite drive for all fashionable persons, and thronged from end to end on every fair afternoon by all manner of vehicles, from dainty pony-wagons to enormous mail-coaches.  There were only a few carriages in sight now, though they seemed many to our little country maid. Shops were opening for the season. Men were busy in hanging Eastern rugs and curtains up to view, and arranging in the windows beautiful jars and plates of porcelain and pottery, glittering wares from Turkey and Damascus, carved furniture, and inlaid cabinets. Half a dozen florists exhibited masses of hot-house flowers amid a tangle of palms and tree-ferns; beyond was the announcement of an \"opening\" by a well-known dressmaker, whose windows were hung with more beautiful things than Candace in her small experience had ever dreamed of before,--laces, silks, embroideries.  The shops gave way to houses, each set in a court-yard gay with newly planted beds of flowers or foliage plants. Vines clustered everywhere; the trees, not yet fully in leaf, were like a tossing spray of delicate fresh green: a sense of hope, of expectation, of something delightful which was being prepared for, seemed to be in the air.  Suddenly the coup turned in between a pair of substantial stone gate-posts, and drew up before a large square house, with piazzas on two sides, and a small but very smooth lawn, whose closely cut grass looked like green velvet. It was dappled with weeping-trees and evergreens, and hedged with a high wall of shrubs which shut off the view of the street. A continuous flower-bed ran all round the house close to its walls, planted full of geraniums, heliotrope, nasturtiums, mignonette, and pansies. Every window and balcony boasted its box of ferns or flowers; and in spite of the squareness of the building, and the sombre green-gray with which it was painted, the general effect was of cheerfulness, and shade broken by color,--an effect which is always pleasant.  Candace had forgotten herself in the excitement of new sights and experiences; but her shyness came back with a rush as the carriage stopped and the door was opened by a very smart French butler.  \"Is Mrs. Gray at home?\" she asked timidly, bending forward.  \"Descendez, Mademoiselle, s'il vous plat. Madame est occupe pour le moment; il y a du monde dans le salon.\" Then, seeing the perplexed look in Candace's eyes, he explained in broken English: \"Mees is to get out. Madame is beesy with coompany for little while. Mees will please go up-stair.\"  Candace got out; the carriage drove away, and she followed the butler into the hall. He gave a low call at the foot of the stairs, which brought down a ladies'-maid with a ruffed cap perched on the back of her head.  \"This way, if you please, Miss,\" she said, and led Candace up the staircase, which was a wide one with three square turns and a broad landing, lit with a range of windows and furnished with a low cushioned seat; then came an upper hall, and she was shown into a pretty corner room.  \"If you'll please sit down and rest yourself, Miss,\" said the maid, \"Mrs. Gray'll be up as soon as some company she has is gone. Would you like to have a cup of tea, Miss?\"  \"No, thank you,\" faltered Candace; and then the maid went away, shutting the door behind her.  The room, which had no bed in it, and was, in fact, Mrs. Gray's morning-room, was so full of curious things that Candace's first thought was that it would take a week at least to see half that was in it. The sage-green walls were thickly hung with photographs, watercolors, charcoal sketches, miniatures, bits of faience, lacquered trays and discs, and great shining circles of Syrian and Benares metalwork. There were many pieces of pottery of various sorts, set here and there, on the chimney-piece, on book-shelves, on the top of a strangely carved black cabinet, with hinges and handles of wrought iron. In one corner stood an Italian spinning-wheel of ebony and silver; in another an odd instrument, whose use Candace could not guess, but which was in reality a Tyrolean zither. An escritoire, drawn near a window, was heaped with papers and with writing appliances of all sorts, and all elegant. There were many little tables covered with books and baskets of crewels and silks, and easy-chairs of every description. Every chair-back and little stand had some quaint piece of lace-work or linen-work thrown over it. It was, in fact, one of those rooms belonging distinctly to our modern life, for the adornment of which every part of the world is ransacked, and their products set forth in queer juxtapositions, to satisfy or to exhibit the varied tastes and pursuits of its occupants. To Candace it was as wonderful as any museum; and while her eyes slowly travelled from one object to another, she forgot her strangeness and was happy.  Tick, tick, tick, tick, went the little French clock on the mantelpiece. Suddenly it struck her that it was a long while that she had been left alone in this room. She glanced at the clock; it really was almost an hour. All her latent homesickness returned with fresh force. Her eyes filled with sudden tears; in another moment she would have been actually crying, but just then came a quick step, a little rustle, and she had just time to wipe away the drops when the door opened, and Mrs. Gray hurried into the room.  \"My poor child,\" she exclaimed, \"have you been alone all this time? It is quite too bad! I made sure that I should hear the carriage drive up, and at least run out and give you a welcome, but somehow I didn't; and people came so fast and thick that I couldn't get a chance to glance at the clock.\" She kissed Candace, and looked at her with a sort of soft scrutiny. It was to the full as penetrating as that of the strange girls on the steamer had been; but it did not hurt like theirs. Mrs. Gray had beautiful, big, short-sighted blue eyes with black lashes; when she smiled they seemed to brim with a sudden fascinating radiance. She smiled now, and reminded Candace somehow of a great, soft, fully opened garden rose.  \"You have something of your mother's looks, Cannie,\" she said. \"I knew her best when she was about your age. I never saw much of her after she married your father and went up to live among the hills.\" She sighed softly: there was a short pause. Then, with a sudden change of tone, she continued: \"And all this time you have never been shown your room. I can't think why they were so stupid. Who was it put you here, Cannie?\"  \"It was--a lady--in a cap,\" replied Candace, hesitatingly.  \"A lady?--cap? Oh, it must have been Elizabeth. She's my maid,--don't make such a mistake again, dear; you must learn to discriminate. Well, come with me now, and let me see you comfortably established. The girls are gone on a yachting-party to the upper end of the island. It was an old engagement, made before your aunt's letter came, or they would not have been absent when you arrived. They were very sor--\"  But in the very middle of the word came Frederic, the butler, with the announcement of new visitors; and, just taking time to lead Candace down the entry to a room whose door stood wide open, Mrs. Gray hurried away, saying rapidly: \"Take off your hat, dear. Lie down for a rest, hadn't you better? I'll be up again presently.\"  \"I wonder if everybody is always in a hurry in Newport?\" Candace thought.  She was again alone, but this time she felt no disposition to cry. Her trunk had been brought up by somebody, and stood already in its place, with the straps unloosened. She took off her hat and jacket, unpacked a little, and peeped out of the window to see where she was. The room faced the east, and across a corner of the lawn and the stable-yard she had a glimpse of the sea, which had become intensely blue with the coming of the later afternoon.  \"Oh, that is good,\" she said to herself. \"I shall see it all summer.\" She glanced about the room with a growing sense of proprietorship which was pleasant. It was not a large room, but it looked cheerful, with its simple furniture of pale-colored ash and a matted floor, over which lay a couple of Persian rugs. There was a small fireplace bordered with blue tiles which matched the blue papering on the walls; and the tiles on the washstand, and the chintz of the easy-chair and lounge, and the flower-jars on the mantelpiece were blue also. Altogether it was a pretty little chamber, with which any girl might be sufficiently well-pleased; and as Candace noticed the tiny nosegay of mignonette and tea-roses which stood on the bureau, her heart lightened with the sense that it had been put there for _her_. Some one had thought of her coming, and prepared for it.  She brushed out her curls and washed her face and hands, but did not change her dress. The blue alpaca was the newest she had, and she wished to look her best on that first evening. She sat down in the window to listen to the soft boom of the surf, which seemed to grow louder as the night drew on, and did not hear Mrs. Gray as she came down the entry. That lady stood a moment in the half-open door, surveying her young visitor.  \"What am I to do with her?\" she thought. \"I want to befriend Candace's child, but I did not quite realize, till I saw her just now, what a disadvantage she would be at among all these girls here, with their French clothes and their worse than French ideas. She's not plain. There's a good deal of beauty about that shy little face of hers, and refinement too, if only she were not so awkward. If I can once get her into a dress that fits, and do something with that mop of curls, she would look well enough. I wonder if she will take it kindly, or flare up and feel offended at every little suggestion. That would be terrible!-- You are listening to the surf, dear. I'm afraid it means rain to-morrow. That sound generally is a symptom of mischief.\"  \"Is it?\" said Candace; \"what a pity!\"  \"A pity about the rain?\"  \"No--but it's such a pretty sound.\"  \"So it is. Well, if you are ready, let us go downstairs. I expect the girls every moment. Ah, there they are now!\"  The line of windows on the staircase landing commanded a view of the gate and approach, and looking through them Candace saw a village cart with two girls on the front seat, one driving, and a third girl in the rumble behind, approaching the house. A couple of young men on horseback rode close beside the cart. One of them jumped from his horse, helped the young ladies out, there was a moment of laughter and chat; then, touching their hats, the riders departed, and the three girls came into the hall.  \"Mamma! mammy! where are you, dear?\" sang out three youthful voices.  \"Here I am, half-way upstairs,\" replied Mrs. Gray, seating herself on the cushioned bench of the landing.  \"What on earth are you doing up there? And who's that with you?\"  \"It's your cousin Candace. Come up and be introduced.\"  Up they came at a run, each trying to be the first to arrive. Candace had never known many girls, but these were of a different species from any she had seen before. They seemed full of spirits, and conveyed the idea of being, so to speak, bursting with happiness, though I suppose not one of the three but would have resented the imputation of being happier than people in general are or ought to be. Georgie, the eldest, was short and round, and had her mother's blue near-sighted eyes without her mother's beauty. Gertrude was unusually tall, and had a sort of lily-like grace; her light hair was very thick, and so fine in quality that it stood out like a nimbus round her pale pretty face. Little Marian, the youngest, two years Candace's junior, was not yet in society, but had been allowed to go to the picnic as a great favor. Her hair had a reddish tint in its chestnut, and was braided in one large plait down her back; she had brown eyes and a capable little face which was full of expression.  They all spoke kindly to Candace, they all kissed her, but she felt much less at ease with them than with their mother, whose peculiarly charming manner seemed to invite confidence from everybody. After a few questions and a few words of welcome, they plunged into a description of their picnic,--the yacht-sail, the landing, the luncheon, the general delightfulness of everything.  \"Berry Joy was not there,\" remarked Georgie. \"She had gone up to Wickford to meet some one. By the way, she must have come down on the 'Eolus' with you, Candace. Did you see her?\"  \"There were two young ladies,\" answered Candace, timidly.  \"Did you hear their names? Did you talk to them?\" asked Gertrude.  \"No--yes--no--I mean the Captain called one of them Miss Joy. I didn't talk to them, but they knew you.\"  \"Why, how could you tell that?\"  \"I heard them talking about you.\"  \"What fun! What did they say?\"  Candace hesitated. Her face grew crimson. \"I'd rather--I don't--\" she began. Then with a great effort, rallying her powers, she went on: \"I didn't like to sit there and hear them and not tell them that I was your cousin; but I was too--too--frightened to speak to them, so I thought I would never repeat what they said, and then it wouldn't be any matter.\"  \"Quite right, Cannie,\" said Mrs. Gray, quickly. Something in the girl's little speech seemed to please her very much.     CHAPTER II.  THE FIRST EVENING.   CANDACE ARDEN'S mother had not only been Mrs. Gray's cousin, but her particular friend as well. The two girls had been brought up together, had shared their studies and secrets and girlish fun, and had scarcely ever been separated for a week, until suddenly a change came which separated them for all the rest of their lives.  Pretty Candace Van Vliet went up to New Haven on her nineteenth birthday to see what a college commencement was like, and at the President's reception afterward met Henry Arden, the valedictorian of the graduating class, a handsome fellow just twenty-one years old. He came of plain farming-people in the hill country of Connecticut; but he was clever, ambitious, and his manners had a natural charm, to which his four years of college life had added ease and the rubbing away of any little rustic awkwardness with which he might have begun. Candace thought him delightful; he thought her more than delightful. In short, it was one of the sudden love-affairs with which college commencements not infrequently end, and in the course of a few weeks they engaged themselves to each other.  Henry was to be a minister, and his theological course must be got through with before they could marry. Three years the course should have taken, but he managed to do it in a little more than two, being spurred on by his impatient desire for home and wife, and a longing, no less urgent, to begin as soon as possible to earn his own bread and relieve his father from the burden of his support. No one knew better than he with what pinching and saving and self-sacrifice it had been made possible for him to get a college education and become a clergyman; what daily self-denials had been endured for his sake in that old yellow farm-house on the North Tolland hills. He was the only son, the only child; and his father and mother were content to bear anything so long as it gave him a chance to make the most of himself.  It is not an uncommon story in this New England of ours. Many and many a farm-house could tell a similar tale of thrift, hard work, and parental love. The bare rocky acres are made to yield their uttermost, the cows to do their full duty, the scanty apples of the \"off year\" are carefully harvested, every pullet and hen is laid under contribution for the great need of the moment,--the getting the boys through college. It is both beautiful and pitiful, as all sacrifices must be; but the years of effort and struggle do not always end, as in the case of the Ardens, with a disappointment and a grief so bitter as to make the self-spending seem all in vain.  For the over-study of those two years proved too much for Henry Arden's health. It was not hard study alone; he stinted himself in food, in firing as well; he exacted every possible exertion from his mind, and systematically neglected his body. The examinations were brilliantly passed; he was ordained; he received a \"call\" to Little Upshire, the village nearest to North Tolland; there was a pretty wedding in the old Van Vliet mansion on Second Avenue, at which Kate Van Vliet, herself just engaged to Courtenay Gray, acted as bridesmaid; and then the cousins parted. They only met once again, when Mrs. Arden came down from the country to see her cousin married. Henry did not come with her; he was not very well, she explained, and she must hurry back.  That was the beginning of a long wasting illness. Some spring of vitality seemed to have been broken during those two terrible years at the theological seminary; and though Henry Arden lived on, and even held his parish for several years, he was never fit for any severe study or labor. The last three years of his life were spent in the old farm-house at North Tolland, where his aunt Myra, a spare, sinewy, capable old maid, was keeping house for his father. Mrs. Arden had died soon after her son's illness began; her heart was \"kind of broken,\" the neighbors said, and perhaps it was.  And little Candace and her mother lived on with the old people after the long, sorrowful nursing was done, and another gray headstone had been placed beside the rest in the Arden lot in the North Tolland graveyard, having carved upon it, \"Sacred to the memory of the Rev. Henry Arden, aged thirty-four. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away. Blessed be His Holy name.\" There seemed nothing else for them to do but to live on where they were. Mrs. Gray was in China with her husband, who at that time was the resident partner in a well-known firm of tea-importers. Aunt Van Vliet had gone to Europe after her daughter's marriage. There was no one to come to the aid of the drooping young widow, and carry her away from the lonely life and the sad memories which were slowly killing her. For her child's sake she did her best to rally; but her strength had been severely taxed during her husband's illness, and dying was easier than living; so she died when Candace was just eight years old, and the little girl and the two old people were left alone in the yellow farm-house.  A twelvemonth later, Grandfather Arden had a stroke of paralysis.--Don't be too much discouraged, dear children; this is positively the last death that I shall have occasion to chronicle in this story. But it seemed necessary to show what sort of life Candace had lived, in order to explain the sort of girl she was.--After her grandfather died, Aunt Myra, aged sixty-nine, and little Cannie, aged nine, alone remained of the once large household; and the farm-house seemed very big and empty, and had strange echoes in all the unused corners.  It was a lonely place, and a lonely life for a child. Candace had few enjoyments, and almost no young companions. She had never been used to either, so she did not feel the want of them as most little girls would have done. Aunt Myra was kind enough, and, indeed, fond of her in a dry, elderly way; but she could not turn herself into a play-mate. It is not often that a person who is as old as sixty-nine remembers how it feels to play. Aunt Myra approved of Cannie especially, because she was \"such a quiet child;\" but I think Cannie's mother would rather have had her noisier.  \"She's a nice girl as I want to see,\" Aunt Myra was wont to tell her cronies. \"She's likely-appearing enough,--and that's better than being too pretty. And she's helpful about the house for such a young cretur, and she's not a bit forth-putting or highty-tighty. I don't know how I should have managed if Candace had turned out the sort of girl some of 'em are,--like those Buell girls, for instance, always raising Ned because they can't get down to Hartford or Bridgeport to shop and see the sights and have a good time. As if good times couldn't be had to home as well as anywhere! Why, I reckon that Miss Buell has more fuss and trouble in fitting out those girls every spring of her life than I've had with Cannie since her mother died. She never makes one mite of difficulty, or bothers with objections. She just puts on whatever I see fit to get her; and she likes it, and there's the end.\"  This was not quite as true as Aunt Myra supposed. Candace wore whatever it was ordained that she should wear, but she did not always \"like\" it. From her mother she inherited a certain instinct of refinement and taste which only needed the chance to show itself. But there was little chance to exercise taste in the old yellow farm-house, and Candace, from training and long habit, was submissive; so she accepted the inevitable, and, as her great-aunt said, \"made no difficulty.\"  Letters came now and then from \"Cousin Kate,\" far away in China, and once a little box with a carved ivory fan as fine as lace-work, a dozen gay pictures on rice paper, and a scarf of watermelon-pink crape, which smelt of sandalwood, and was by far the most beautiful thing that Cannie had ever seen. Then, two years before our story opens, the Grays came back to America to live; and a correspondence began between Mrs. Gray and Aunt Myra, part of which Candace heard about and part she did not. Mrs. Gray was anxious to know her cousin's child and be of use to her; but first one thing and then another delayed their meeting. The first winter the Grays spent at a hotel looking for a house; the second, they were all in Florida on account of Mr. Gray's health. These difficulties were now settled. A town house had been chosen, a Newport cottage leased for a term of years, and Cannie was asked for a long summer visit.  It was Mrs. Gray's secret desire that this visit should lead to a sort of adoption, that Cannie should stay on with them as a fourth daughter, and share all her cousins' advantages of education and society; but before committing herself to such a step, she wished to see what the girl was like.  \"It's so much easier to keep out of such an arrangement than to get out of it,\" she told her husband. \"My poor Candace was an angel, all sweetness and charm; but her child has the blood of those stiff Connecticut farmers in her. She may be like her father's people, and not in the least like her mother; she may be hopelessly stupid or vulgar or obstinate or un-improvable. We will wait and see.\"  This secret doubt and question was, I think, the reason why Mrs. Gray was so pleased at Cannie's little speech about Miss Joy and her friend.  \"That was the true, honorable feeling,\" she thought to herself; \"the child is a lady by instinct. It wasn't easy for her to say it, either; she's a shy little thing. Well, if she has the instinct, the rest can be added. It's easy enough to polish a piece of mahogany, but you may rub all day at a pine stick and not make much out of it.\"  As these thoughts passed rapidly through her mind, she stole her arm across Candace's shoulders and gave them a little warm pressure; but all she said was,--  \"Dinner in twenty minutes, children. You would better run up at once and make ready. Cannie, you and I will go to the library,--you haven't seen my husband yet.\"  The library was a big, airy room, with an outlook to the sea. There were not many books in it, only enough to fill a single low range of book-shelves; but the tables were covered with freshly cut magazines and pamphlet novels; there was a great file of \"Punch\" and other illustrated papers, and that air of light-reading-in-abundance which seems to suit a house in summer-time. A little wood-fire was snapping on a pair of very bright andirons, and, June though it was, its warmth was agreeable. Beside it, in an enormous Russia-leather armchair, sat Mr. Gray,--an iron-whiskered, shrewd-looking man of the world, with a pair of pleasant, kindly eyes, and that shining bald spot on his head which seems characteristic of the modern business man.  \"Court, here is our new child,\" said Mrs. Gray; \"poor Candace's daughter, you know.\"  Mr. Gray understood, from his wife's tone, that she was pleased with her little visitor so far, and he greeted her in a very friendly fashion.  \"You have your mother's eyes,\" he said. \"I recollect her perfectly, though we only met two or three times, and that was seventeen--let me see--nearly eighteen years ago it must have been. Her hair, too, I should say,\" glancing at Cannie's chestnut mop; \"it was very thick, I remember, and curled naturally.\"  \"Aunt Myra always says that my hair is the same color as mother's,\" replied Candace.  \"It is almost exactly the same. Do you remember her at all, Cannie?\" asked Mrs. Gray.  \"Just a little. I recollect things she used to wear, and where she used to sit, and one or two things she said. But perhaps I don't recollect them, but think I do because Aunt Myra told them to me.\"  \"Is there no picture of her?\"  \"Only a tin-type, and it isn't very good. It's almost faded out; you can hardly see the face.\"  \"What a pity!\"  \"Le dner est servi, Madame,\" said the voice of Frederic at the door.  \"We won't wait for the girls. They will be down in a moment,\" said Mrs. Gray, as she led the way to the dining-room. The sound of their feet on the staircase was heard as she spoke; and down they ran, the elder two in pretty dresses of thin white woollen stuff, which Candace in her unworldliness thought fine enough for a party.  People in North Tolland did not dine in the modern sense of the word. They took in supplies of food at stated intervals, very much as a locomotive stops for wood and water when it cannot go on any longer without such replenishment; but it was a matter of business and necessity to do so rather than of pleasure.  Candace, who had sat down opposite Aunt Myra every day as long as she could remember at the small pine table in the yellow-painted kitchen, with always the same thick iron-stone ware plates and cups, the same little black tray to hold the tea-things, the same good, substantial, prosaic fare, served without the least attempt at grace or decoration, had never dreamed of such a dinner as was usual at the Grays'. She said not a word to express her astonishment; but she glanced at the thick cluster of maiden-hair ferns which quivered in the middle of the table from an oval stand of repouss brass, at the slender glasses of tea-roses which stood on either side, at the Svres dishes of fruit, sweet biscuits, and dried ginger, and wondered if this were to be all the dinner. Did fashionable people never eat anything more substantial than grapes and crackers? She felt very hungry, and yet it seemed coarse not to be satisfied when everything was so pretty.  \"Consomm, Mademoiselle?\" murmured Frederic in her ear, as he placed before her a plate full of some clear liquid which smelt deliciously, and offered a small dish of grated cheese for her acceptance.  \"Oh, thank you, sir,\" said Candace, wondering confusedly if cheese in soup was the correct thing.  Mrs. Gray's quick ear caught the \"sir.\" She did not even turn her head, but she mentally added another to the hints which must be administered to Candace as soon as she was sufficiently at home to bear them.  Spanish mackerel was the next course. Candace inadvertently took up the steel knife placed beside her plate, instead of the silver one meant for use with fish. The result was that when the saddle of mutton was served, she had no usable knife. Mr. Gray observed her difficulty, and directed Frederic to bring a steel knife for Mademoiselle, which Frederic did, first casting a scrutinizing glance about as if in search of something; and again Candace felt that she was somehow out of the way.  The climax of her discomfort came with the pretty tinted fruit plates and finger-bowls. Candace's tumbler was empty, and without particularly thinking about the matter she took a drink out of her finger-bowl, which she mistook for some sort of lemonade, from the bit of lemon which floated in the water.  The moment after, she was conscious of her blunder. She saw Georgie dabbling her fingers in her bowl. She saw Gertrude with difficulty keeping back a smile which would flicker in her eyes, though her lips were rigidly grave. Little Marian giggled outright, and then relapsed into a frightened solemnity. Candace felt utterly miserable. She looked toward Mrs. Gray apprehensively, but that lady only gave her an encouraging smile. Mr. Gray put a bunch of hot-house grapes on her plate. She ate them without the least idea of their flavor. With the last grape a hot tear splashed down; and the moment Mrs. Gray moved, Candace fled upstairs to her own room, where she broke down into a fit of homesick crying.  How she longed for the old customary home among the hills, where nobody minded what she did, or how she ate, or \"had any manners in particular,\" as she phrased it to her own mind, or thought her ignorant or awkward. And yet, on sober second thought, did she really wish so much to go back? Was it not better to stay on where she was, and learn to be graceful and low-spoken and at ease always, like her cousin Kate, if she could, even if she had to undergo some mortification in the process? Candace was not sure.  She had stopped crying, and was cooling her eyes with a wet towel when she heard a little tap at the door. It was Mrs. Gray herself.  \"Where are you, Cannie?\" she said, looking about the room with her short-sighted eyes. \"You are so dark here that I cannot see you.\"  \"I'm here by the washstand,\" faltered Candace; and then, to her dismay, she began to cry again. She tried to subdue it; but a little sob, which all her efforts could not stifle, fell upon her cousin's observant ear.  \"My dear child, you are crying,\" she exclaimed; and in another minute Candace, she scarcely knew how, was in Mrs. Gray's arms, they were sitting on the sofa together, and she was finishing her cry with her head on the kindest of shoulders and an unexpected feeling of comfort at her heart. Anything so soft and tender as Cousin Kate's arms she had never known before; there was a perfume of motherliness about them which to a motherless girl was wholly irresistible. Gertrude declared that mamma always stroked people's trouble away with those hands of hers, and that they looked just like the hands of the Virgin in Holbein's Madonna, as if they could mother the whole world.  \"Now, tell me, Cannie, tell me, dear child,\" said Mrs. Gray, when the shower was over and the hard sobs had grown faint and far between, \"what made you cry? Was it because you are tired and a little homesick among us all, or were you troubled about anything? Tell me, Cannie.\"  \"Oh, it's only because I'm so stupid and--and--countrified,\" said Candace, beginning to sob again. \"I made such horrid mistakes at dinner, and Gertrude wanted to laugh,--she didn't laugh, but I saw her want to,--and Marian did laugh, and I felt so badly.\"  \"Marian is such a little girl that you must forgive her this once,\" said Mrs. Gray, \"though I am rather ashamed of her myself. I saw all your 'mistakes,' as you call them, Cannie, even one or two that you didn't see yourself. They were very little mistakes, dear, not worth crying about,--small blunders in social etiquette, which is a matter of minor importance,--not failures in good feeling or good manners, which are of real consequence. They did not make anybody uncomfortable except yourself.\"  \"Cousin Kate,\" Candace ventured to ask, \"will you tell me why there is such a thing as etiquette? Why must everybody eat and behave and speak in the same way, and make rules about it? Is it any real use?\"  \"That is rather a large question, and leads back to the beginning of things,\" said Mrs. Gray, smiling. \"I don't suppose I quite understand it myself, but I think I can make you understand a part of it. I imagine, when the world was first peopled, in the strange faraway times of which we know almost nothing except the hints we get in the Bible, that the few people there were did pretty much as they liked. Noah and his family in the ark, for instance, probably never set any tables or had any regular meals, but just ate when they were hungry, each one by himself. Savage tribes do the same to this day; they seize their bone or their handful of meat and gnaw it in a corner, or as they walk about. This was the primitive idea of comfort. But after a time people found that it was less trouble to have the family food made ready at a certain time for everybody at once, and have all come together to eat it. Perhaps at first it was served in one great pot or dish, and each one dipped in his hand or spoon. The Arabs still do this. Then, of course, the strongest and greediest got the most of everything, and it may have been some weak or slow person who went hungry in consequence, who invented the idea of separate plates and portions.\"  \"But that is not etiquette,\" objected Cannie. \"People have plates and set tables everywhere now,--in this country, I mean.\"  \"Yes, but can't you imagine a time when to have a bowl or a saucer to yourself was considered finical and 'stuck up,' and when some rough Frank or Gaul from the mountains looked on disapprovingly, and said that the world was coming to a pretty pass if such daintiness was to be allowed? A bowl to one's self was etiquette then. All sorts of things which to us seem matter of course and commonplace, began by being novelties and subjects for discussion and wonderment. Remember that tea, potatoes, carpets, tobacco, matches, almost all our modern conveniences, were quite unknown even so lately as four or five hundred years ago. As the world grew richer, people went on growing more refined. The richest folks tried to make their houses more beautiful than the houses of their neighbors. They gave splendid feasts, and hired sculptors and artists to invent decorations for their tables, and all kinds of little elegant usages sprang up which have gradually become the custom of our own day, even among people who are not rich and do not give feasts.\"  \"But do they mean anything? Are they of any real use?\" persisted Cannie.  \"I confess that some of them do not seem to mean a great deal. Still, if we look closely, I think we shall find that almost every one had its origin in one of two causes,--either it was a help to personal convenience, or in some way it made people more agreeable or less disagreeable to their neighbors. We have to study, and to guess a little sometimes, to make out just why it has become customary to do this or that, for the original reason has been forgotten or perhaps does not exist any longer, while the custom remains.\"  \"I wonder,\" said Cannie, whose mind was still running on her own mishaps, \"why people mustn't cut fish with a steel knife. I read in a book once that it was not genteel to do so, and I couldn't think why. And then to-night I didn't see the little silver one--\"  \"I imagine that in the first instance some old _gourmet_ discovered or fancied that a steel knife gave a taste to fish which injured it. So people gave up using knives, and it grew to be said that it was vulgar and a mark of ignorance to cut fish with them. Then, later, it was found not to be quite comfortable always to tear your bit of fish apart with a fork and hold it down with a piece of bread while you did so, and the custom arose of having a silver knife to cut fish with. It is a convenient custom, too, for some reasons. Waiting on table is quite an art, now-a-days, when there are so many changes of plates, and a good waiter always tries to simplify what he has to do, by providing as much as possible beforehand. You can see that if each person has beside his plate a silver knife for fish and a steel knife for meat and two forks these two courses will go on more easily and quietly than if the waiter has to stop and bring a fresh knife and fork for each person before he helps to the dish, whatever it is.\"  \"But why is there nothing on the table but flowers and pretty little things? And why do they put lemon-peel in the bowls of water?\"  \"Well, the lemon is supposed to take the smell of dinner away from the fingers. And it isn't always lemon. Frederic is apt to drop in a geranium leaf or a sprig of lemon-verbena, and those are nicer. As for the other thing, it is more convenient for many reasons not to have the carving done on the table; but aside from that, I imagine that in the first instance the custom was a matter of economy.\"  \"Economy!\" repeated Candace, opening wide her eyes.  \"Yes, economy, though it seems droll to say so. In the old days, when the meat came on in a big platter, and the vegetables each in its large covered dish, people had to put more on table than was really wanted, for the sake of not looking mean and giving their neighbors occasion for talk. Now, when everything is carved on a side-table and a nice little portion carried to each person, you are able to do with exactly what is needed. There need not be a great piece of everything left over for look's sake. One chicken is enough for four or five people if it is skilfully carved, but the chicken would look rather scanty on a platter by itself; don't you think so?\"  \"Yes,\" said Cannie, with a little laugh. She had forgotten her troubles in the interest of the discussion.  \"A dish containing one mutton-chop and a spoonful of peas for each person would be called a stingy dish in the country, where every one sees his food on the table before him,\" continued Mrs. Gray; \"but it is quite enough for the single course it is meant to be at a city dinner. There is no use in having three or four chops left over to toughen and grow cold.\"  \"I see,\" said Cannie, thoughtfully; \"what else did I do that was wrong, Cousin Kate?\"  \"You called Frederic 'sir,'\" replied her cousin, with a smile. \"That was not wrong, but not customary. Servants are expected to say 'sir' and 'ma'am' to their employers as a mark of respect; and people not servants use the word less frequently than they formerly did. They keep such terms for elderly or distinguished persons, to whom they wish to show special deference.\"  \"But Aunt Myra always _made_ me say 'sir' and 'ma'am' to her and grandpapa. She said it was impolite not to.\"  \"She was quite right; for she and your grandfather were a great deal older than yourself, and it was only respectful to address them so. But you need not use the phrase to everybody to whom you speak.\"  \"Not to you?\"  \"Well, I would quite as soon that in speaking to me you said, 'Yes, Cousin Kate,' as 'Yes, ma'am.' That is what I have taught my children to do. They say, 'Yes, mamma;' 'Did you call me, papa?' I like the sound of it better; but it is only a matter of taste. There is no real right or wrong involved in it.\"  Candace sat for a moment in silence, revolving these new ideas in her mind.  \"Cousin Kate,\" she said timidly, \"will you tell me when I make little mistakes, like that about the knife? I'd like to learn to do things right if I could, and if it wouldn't trouble you too much.\"  \"Dear Cannie,\"--and Mrs. Gray kissed her,--\"I will, of course; and I am glad you like to have me. Your mother was the sweetest, most refined little lady that I ever knew. I loved her dearly; and I should love to treat you as I do my own girls, to whom I have to give a hint or a caution or a little lecture almost every day of their lives. No girl ever grew into a graceful, well-bred woman without many such small lessons from somebody. If your mother had lived, all these things would have come naturally to you from the mere fact of being with her and noticing what she did. You would have needed no help from any one else. But are you sure,\" she went on, after a little pause, \"that you won't end by thinking me tiresome or interfering or worrisome, if I do as I say?\"  \"No, indeed, I won't!\" cried Candace, to whom this long talk had been like the clearing up after a thunder-shower. \"I think it would be _too_ mean if I felt that way when you are so kind.\"     CHAPTER III.  A WALK ON THE CLIFFS.   IT is always an odd, unhomelike moment when one wakes up for the first time in a new place. Sleep is a separation between us and all that has gone before it. It takes a little while to recollect where we are and how we came there, and to get used to the strangeness which had partly worn away, but has come on again while we dreamed and forgot all about it.  Candace experienced this when she woke in the little blue room the morning after her arrival in Newport. She had gone to bed, by Mrs. Gray's advice, when their long talk about manners and customs was ended, and without going downstairs again.  \"You are very tired, I can see,\" said Cousin Kate. \"A long night's sleep will freshen you, and the world will look differently and a great deal pleasanter to-morrow.\"  Candace was glad to follow this counsel. She _was_ tired, and she felt shy of Mr. Gray and the girls, and would rather put off meeting them again, she thought, till the morning. Ten hours of unbroken sleep rested her thoroughly, but she woke with a feeling of puzzled surprise at her surroundings, and for a few moments could not gather up her thoughts or quite recollect where she was. Then it all came back to her, and she was again conscious of the uncomfortable sensations of the night before.  She lay a little while thinking about it, and half wishing that she need not get up at all but just burrow under the blanket and hide herself, like a mouse or rabbit in his downy hole, till everybody had forgotten her blunders, and till she herself could forget them. But she said to herself bravely: \"I won't be foolish. Cousin Kate is just lovely; she's promised to help me, and I'm sure she will. I will try not to mind the others; but, oh dear! I wish I were not so afraid of the girls.\"  She jumped out of bed resolutely and began to dress, taking her time about it, and stealing many glances out of the open window; for she knew it must be early, and as yet there were no sounds of life about the house. After her hair was curled, she stood for some time at the door of the closet, debating what dress she should put on.  The choice was limited. There were only a brown plaided gingham, a blue calico, and a thick white cambric to choose from. The latter seemed to her almost too nice to be worn in the morning. It was the first white dress she had ever been allowed to have, and Aunt Myra had said a good deal about the difficulty of getting it done up; so it seemed to Candace rather a sacred garment, which should be reserved for special state occasions.  After hesitating awhile she put on the brown gingham. It had a little ruffle basted round the neck. Candace tried the effect of a large blue bow, and then of a muslin one, very broad, with worked ends; but neither pleased her exactly. She recollected that Georgie and Gertrude had worn simple little ruches the night before, with no bows; and at last she wisely decided to fasten her ruffle with the little bar of silver which was her sole possession by way of ornament, for her mother's few trinkets had all been sold during her father's long illness. This pin had been a present from the worldly-minded Mrs. Buell, who so often furnished a text to Aunt Myra's homilies. She had one day heard Cannie say, when asked by one of the Buell daughters if she had any jewelry, \"Are napkin-rings jewelry? I've got a napkin-ring.\" Mrs. Buell had laughed at the droll little speech, and repeated it as a good joke; but the next time she went to Hartford she bought the silver pin for Cannie, who was delighted, and held it as her choicest possession.  Her dressing finished, Candace went softly downstairs. She paused at the staircase window to look out. Cousin Kate's storm had not come after all. The day was brilliantly fair. Long fingers of sunshine were feeling their way through the tree-branches, seeking out shady corners and giving caressing touches to all growing things. A book lay on the window-bench. It was \"A York and a Lancaster Rose,\" which little Marian had been reading the night before. It looked interesting, and, seeing by a glance at the tall clock in the hall below that it was but a little after seven, Candace settled herself for a long, comfortable reading before breakfast.  Mrs. Gray was the first of the family to appear. She swept rapidly downstairs in her pretty morning wrapper of pale pink, with a small muslin cap trimmed with ribbons of the same shade on her glossy black hair, and paused to give Cannie a rapid little kiss; but she looked preoccupied, and paid no further attention to her, beyond a kind word or two, till breakfast was over, the orders for the day given, half a dozen notes answered, and half a dozen persons seen on business. The girls seemed equally busy. Each had her own special little task to do. Georgie looked over the book-tables and writing-tables; sorted, tidied, put away the old newspapers; made sure that there was ink in the inkstands and pens and paper in plenty. After this was done, she set to work to water the plant boxes and stands in the hall and on the piazza. Gertrude fell upon a large box of freshly cut flowers, and began to arrange them in various bowls and vases. Little Marian had three cages of birds to attend to, which, as she was very particular about their baths and behavior, took a long time. Candace alone had nothing to do, and sat by, feeling idle and left out among the rest.  \"I think I shall put you in charge of the piazza boxes,\" said Mrs. Gray, noticing her forlorn look as she came back from her interview with the fishmonger. \"See, Cannie, the watering-pot is kept _here_, and the faucet of cold water is just there in the pantry. Would you like to take them as a little bit of daily regular work? They must be sprinkled every morning; and if the earth is dry they must be thoroughly watered, and all the seed-pods and yellow leaves and dead flowers must be picked off. Do you feel as if you could do it?\"  \"Oh, I should like to,\" said Cannie, brightening.  \"Very well. Georgie has plenty to attend to without them, I imagine. She will be glad to be helped. Georgie, Cannie has agreed to take the care of all the outside flower-boxes in future. You needn't have them on your mind any more.\"  \"That's nice,\" said Georgie, good-naturedly. \"Then I will look after the plants on your balcony, mamma. Elizabeth doesn't half see to them.\"  \"Oh, mightn't I do those too?\" urged Cannie. \"I wish you would let me.\"  \"Well, you can if you like. They are all watered for to-day, though. You needn't begin till to-morrow.\"  \"That is just as well,\" said Mrs. Gray; \"for now that I am through with the orders and the tradesmen, I want Cannie to come up to the morning-room for a consultation. Georgie, you may come too. It's about your hair, Cannie. Those thick curls are very pretty, but they look a trifle old-fashioned, and I should think must be rather hot, like a little warm shawl always on your shoulders all summer long.\" She stroked the curls with her soft hand, as she spoke. \"Should you dislike to have them knotted up, Cannie? You are quite old enough, I think.\"  \"No, I shouldn't dislike it, but I don't know how to do my hair in any other way. I have always worn it like this.\"  \"We'll teach you,\" cried Georgie and Gertrude, who had joined them while her mother was speaking. \"Let us have a 'Council of Three' in the morning-room, and see what is most becoming to her.\"  So upstairs they went, and the girls pounced on Cannie, and put a towel over her shoulders, and brushed out her curls, and tried this way and that, while Mrs. Gray sat by and laughed. She would not interfere,--though Cannie at times resisted, and declared that they were pulling her hair and hurting her dreadfully,--for she was anxious that the cousins should grow intimate and familiar with each other. In fact, Cannie's shyness was quite shaken out of her for the moment; and before the experiments were ended, and it was decided that a little bang on the forehead, and what Marian called a \"curly knot\" behind, suited her best, she felt almost at home with Georgie and Gertrude.  \"There,\" said Georgie, sticking in a last hair-pin, \"come and see yourself; and if you don't confess that you are improved, you're a very ungrateful young person, and that is all I have to say.\"  Candace scarcely knew her own face when she was led up to the looking-glass. The light rings of hair lay very prettily on the forehead, the \"curly knot\" showed the shape of the small head; it all looked easy and natural, and as if it was meant to be so. She smiled involuntarily. The girl in the glass smiled back.  \"Why, I look exactly like somebody else and not a bit like myself,\" she cried. \"What _would_ Aunt Myra say to me?\"  \"I am going out to do some errands,\" said Mrs. Gray; \"will you come along, Cannie, and have a little drive?\"  Mrs. Gray's errands seemed to be principally on behalf of her young companion. First they stopped at Seabury's, and after Mrs. Gray had selected a pair of \"Newport ties\" for herself, she ordered a similar pair for Candace. Then she said that while Cannie's shoe was off she might as well try on some boots, and Cannie found herself being fitted with a slender, shapely pair of black kid, which were not only prettier but more comfortable than the country-made ones which had made her foot look so clumsy. After that they stopped at a carpet and curtain place, where Cannie was much diverted at hearing the proprietor recommend tassels instead of plated rings on certain Holland shades, for the reason that \"a tossel had more poetry about it somehow.\" Then, after a brief pause to order strawberries and fresh lettuce, the carriage was ordered to a milliner's.  \"I want to get you a little hat of some sort,\" said Cousin Kate. \"The one you wore yesterday is rather old for a girl of your age. I will retrim it some day, and it will do for picnics and sails, but you need more hats than one in this climate, which is fatal to ribbons and feathers, and takes the stiffness out of everything.\"  So a big, shady hat of dark red straw, with just a scarf of the same color twisted round the crown and a knowing little wing in front, was chosen; and then Mrs. Gray spied a smaller one of fine yellowish straw with a wreath of brown-centred daisies, and having popped it on Cannie's head for one moment, liked the effect, and ordered that too. Two new hats! It seemed to Cannie's modest ideas like the wildest extravagance; and after they returned to the coup she found courage to say,--  \"Cousin Kate, please, you mustn't buy me too many things.\"  \"No, dear, I won't. I'll be careful,\" replied Mrs. Gray, smiling. Then, seeing that Cannie was in earnest, she added, more seriously: \"My child, I've no wish to make you fine. I don't like finery for young girls; but one needs a good many things in a place like this, and I want to have you properly dressed in a simple way. It was agreed upon between Aunt Myra and myself that I should see to your summer wardrobe after you got here, because Newport is a better shopping-place than North Tolland; and while we are about it, we may as well get pretty things as ugly ones. It doesn't cost any more and is no more trouble, and I am sure you like them better, don't you?\"  \"Oh, yes, indeed,\" replied Cannie, quite relieved by this explanation. \"I like pretty things ever so much--only--I thought--I was afraid--\" She did not know how to finish her sentence.  [Illustration: THE OLD STONE MILL.  It was a roofless circular tower, supported on round arches.--PAGE 73.]  \"You were afraid I was ruining myself,\" asked her cousin, looking amused. \"No, Cannie, I won't do that, I promise you; and in return, you will please let me just settle about a few little necessary things for you, just as I should for Georgie and Gertrude, and say no more about it. Ah! there is the old Mill; you will like to see that. Stop a moment, John.\"  The coup stopped accordingly by a small open square, planted with grass and a few trees, and intersected with paths. There was a music-stand in the centre, a statue on a pedestal; and close by them, rising from the greensward, appeared a small, curious structure of stone. It was a roofless circular tower, supported on round arches, which made a series of openings about its base. Cannie had never heard of the Stone Mill before, and she listened eagerly while Mrs. Gray explained that it had stood there since the earliest days of the Colony; that no one knew exactly how old it was, who built it, or for what purpose it was built; and that antiquarians were at variance upon these points, and had made all sorts of guesses about its origin. Some insisted that it was erected by the Norsemen, who were the first to discover the New England shores, long before the days of Columbus; others supposed it to be a fragment of an ancient church. Others again--and Mrs. Gray supposed that these last were probably nearest the truth--insisted that it was just what it seemed to be, a mill for grinding corn; and pointed out the fact that mills of very much the same shape still exist in old country neighborhoods in England. She also told Cannie that the mill used to be thickly overhung with ivies and Virginia creepers, and that it had never been so pretty and picturesque since the town authorities, under a mistaken apprehension that the roots of the vines were injuring the masonry, had torn them all away and left the ruin bare and unornamented, as she now saw it.  \"Did you never read Longfellow's 'Skeleton in Armor'?\" she asked; and when Cannie said no, she repeated part of the poem, and promised to find the rest for Cannie to read when they got home. Then they drove on; and Cannie's head was so full of \"Lief the son of Arnulf,\" the \"fearful guest,\" and the maiden whose heart under her loosened vest fluttered like doves \"in their nest frighted,\" that she could hardly bring herself back to real life, even when Cousin Kate stopped at a famous dress-furnisher's in the Casino Block, and caused her to be measured for two dresses. One was of white woollen stuff, like those which Georgie and Gertrude had worn the night before; the other, a darker one, of cream-and-brown foulard, which Mrs. Gray explained would be nice for church and for driving and for cool days, of which there were always plenty in the Newport summer. She also bought a little brown parasol for Cannie, and a tightly fitting brown jacket to match the foulard; and altogether it was a most exciting and adventurous morning. Cannie, as she took off her hat at home and fluffed the newly constructed \"bang\" into shape with gentle finger-touches, asked herself if it could be really only a day and a half since she said good-by to Aunt Myra in North Tolland; and if in fact it were really herself, little Candace Arden, to whom these wonderful things belonged, or was it some one else? Perhaps it was all a dream, and she should presently wake up. \"If it be I, as I believe it be,\" was the tenor of her thought, as of the old woman in the nursery rhyme; only Cannie had no little dog at hand to help her to a realization of her own identity.  Into Candace's bare little cradle in the hill country had been dropped one precious endowment. From both her father and her mother she inherited the love of reading. If old tales were true, and the gift-conferring fairies really came to stand round a baby's bed, each with a present in her hand, I think out of all that they could bestow I should choose for any child in whom I was interested, these two things,--a quick sense of humor and a love for books. There is nothing so lasting or so satisfying. Riches may take wing, beauty fade, grace vanish into fat, a sweet voice become harsh, rheumatism may cripple the fingers which played or painted so deftly,--with each and all of these delightful things time may play sad tricks; but to life's end the power to see the droll side of events is an unfailing cheer, and so long as eyes and ears last, books furnish a world of interest and escape whose doors stand always open. Winds may blow and skies may rain, fortune may prove unkind, days may be lonely and evenings dull; but for the true lover of reading there is always at hand this great company of companions and friends,--the wisest, the gentlest, the best,--never too tired or too busy to talk with him, ready at all moments to give their thought, their teaching, to help, instruct, and entertain. They never disappoint, they have no moods or tempers, they are always at home,--in all of which respects they differ from the rest of our acquaintance. If the man who invented sleep is to be blessed, thrice blessed be the man who invented printing!  There were not many books in the old yellow farm-house at North Tolland; but all that there were Cannie had read over and over again. Shakspeare she knew by heart, and \"Paradise Lost,\" and Young's \"Night Thoughts,\" and Pollock's \"Course of Time.\" She had dipped into her dead father's theological library, and managed to extract some food for her imagination, even from such dry bones as \"Paley's Evidences\" and \"Edwards on the Will and the Affections.\" Any book was better than no book to her. Aunt Myra, who discouraged the practice of reading for girls as unfitting them for any sort of useful work, used to declare that the very sight of a book made Cannie deaf and blind and dumb.  \"You might as well be Laura what's-her-name and have done with it,\" she would tell her; \"only I don't know where to look for a Dr. Howe or a Dr. anybody, who will come along and teach you to develop your faculties. I declare, I believe you'd rather read a dictionary any day than not read at all.\"  \"I don't know but I would,\" said Cannie; but she said it to herself. She was rather afraid of Aunt Myra.  With this strong love of reading, the girl's delight may be imagined when Mrs. Gray, true to her promise, put into her hands a great illustrated volume of Longfellow, and left her free to dip and select and read as long as she chose. She curled herself up on the staircase bench, and was soon so deep in \"The Skeleton in Armor\" as to be quite oblivious to all that went on below. She did not hear the bell ring, she did not see various ladies shown into the drawing-room, or notice the hum of conversation that followed. She never lifted her eyes when Georgie Gray and a friend, who was no other than the identical Miss Joy of the \"Eolus,\" stood at the staircase foot for some moments and held a whispered conversation; nor was she conscious of the side glances which the visitor now and then cast up toward the brown gingham skirt visible above. It was not till            \"_Skoal!_ to the Northland! _skoal!_\"  ended the poem, that her dream ended, and she roused herself to find the callers gone and luncheon on the table.  Mrs. Gray was wont to say that they always had a meal at noon and a meal at night; and when her husband was at home, the first was called lunch and the second dinner, and when he was away the first was called dinner and the second supper; and that the principal difference between them was that at one there was soup and at the other there was not. Candace did not particularly care what the meal was called. Under any name she was glad of it, for sea-air and a morning drive had made her very hungry; and this time she was on her guard, watched carefully what others did, and made no serious blunders.  \"What are you girls going to do this afternoon?\" asked Mrs. Gray.  \"Berry Joy has asked me to drive with her,\" replied Georgie; \"she wants to take her friend over to the Fort to hear the band play. You have no objection, have you, mamma?\"  \"No; none at all. And you, Gertrude?\"  \"I haven't made any particular plan.\"  \"Then suppose you and Candace take a walk on the Cliffs. I have to take Marian to the dentist; but Cannie has not seen the sea yet, except at a distance, and you both ought to have a good exercise in the fresh air, for I am almost sure it will rain by to-morrow. You might take her to the beach, Gertrude, and come home by Marine Avenue.\"  \"Very well, mamma; I will, certainly,\" said Gertrude. But there was a lack of heartiness in her tone. Like most very young girls she had a strong sense of the observant eyes of Mrs. Grundy, and she did not at all approve of the brown gingham. \"I wonder why mamma can't wait till she has made Cannie look like other people,\" she was saying to herself.  There was no help for it, however. None of Mrs. Gray's children ever thought of disputing her arrangements for a moment; so the two girls set forth, Cannie in the despised gingham, and Gertrude in a closely fitting suit of blue serge, with a large hat of the same blue, which stood out like a frame round the delicate oval of her face, and set off the feathery light hair to perfection.  Their way for a little distance was down a sort of country lane, which was the short cut to the Cliffs. It ended in a smooth greensward at the top of a wall of broken rocks; and, standing on the edge, Cannie called out, \"Oh!\" with a sense of sudden surprise and freedom.  Before her was a bay of the softest blue, with here and there a line of white surf, where long rollers were sweeping in toward the distant beach. Opposite, stretched a point of land rising into a low hill, which shone in the yellow afternoon sun; and from its end the unbroken sea stretched away into a lovely distance, whose color was like that of an opal, and which had no boundary but a mysterious dim line of faintly tinted sky. Sails shone against the moving water; gulls were dipping and diving; a flock of wild-ducks with glossy black heads swam a little away out from the shore. Beyond the point which made the other arm of the little bay rose an island, ramparted by rocks, over which the surf could be seen to break with an occasional toss of spray. There was a delicious smell of soft salty freshness, and something besides,--a kind of perfume which Candace could not understand or name.  \"Oh, what is it; what can it be?\" she said.  \"What?\"  \"The smell. It is like flowers. Oh, there it is again!\"  \"Mamma makes believe that it is the Spice Islands,\" answered Gertrude, indifferently, \"or else Madeira. You know there is nothing between us and the coast of Africa except islands.\"  \"Really and truly? How wonderful!\"  \"Well, I don't see how it is so very wonderful. It just happens so. I suppose there are plenty of sea-side places where they can say the same thing.\"  \"Perhaps,--but I never saw any sea-coast but this. It is all new to me.\"  \"I suppose so,\" responded Gertrude, with a little yawn. She looked to right and to left, fearing that some acquaintance might be coming to see her in company with this rather shabby little companion. \"Would you like to walk up the Cliffs a little way, or shall we go down to the beach?\" she asked.  \"Oh, let us just go as far as that point,\" said Candace, indicating where, to the right, past a turnstile, a smooth gravel path wound its way between the beautifully kept borders of grass. The path ran on the very edge of the Cliff, and the outer turf dipped at a steep incline to where the sharp rock ran down perpendicularly, but to the very verge it was as fine and as perfectly cut as anywhere else. Candace wondered who held the gardeners and kept them safe while they shaved the grass so smoothly in this dangerous spot, but she did not like to ask. Gertrude's indifferent manner drove her in upon herself and made her shy.  A hundred feet and more below them the sea was washing into innumerable rocky fissures with a hollow booming sound. The cliff-line was broken into all sorts of bold forms,--buttresses and parapets and sharp inclines, with here and there a shallow cave or a bit of shingly beach. Every moment the color of the water seemed to change, and the soft duns and purples of the horizon line to grow more intense. Candace had no eyes but for the sea. She scarcely noticed the handsome houses on her right hand, each standing in its wide lawn, with shrubberies and beds of dazzling flowers. Gertrude, on the contrary, scarcely looked at the sea. It was an old story to her; and she was much more interested in trying to make out people she knew at the windows of the houses they passed, or on their piazzas, and in speculating about the carriages which could be seen moving on the distant road.  \"How good it is of the people who own the places to let everybody go through them!\" exclaimed Candace, when it was explained to her that the Cliff walk was a public one.  \"Oh, they can't help themselves. There is a right of way all round the Island, and nobody would be allowed to close it. Some owners grumble and don't like it a bit; but mamma says it is one of the best things in Newport, and that it would be a great injury to the place to have it taken away. The Cliff walk is very celebrated, you know. Lots of people have written things about it.\"  \"Oh, I should think they would. It is the most beautiful place I ever saw.\"  \"You haven't seen many places, have you?\" observed Gertrude, rather impolitely.  \"Oh no, I never saw anything but North Tolland till I came to Newport.\"  \"Then you can't judge.\"  They had now turned, and were walking eastward toward the beach. Its line of breaking surf could be distinctly seen now. Carriages and people on horseback were driving or riding along the sands, and groups of black dots were discernible, which were other people on foot.  \"There is Pulpit Rock,\" said Gertrude, stopping where a shelving path slanted down toward a great square mass of stone, which was surrounded on three sides by water. \"Would you like to go down and sit on top for a little while? I am rather tired.\"  \"Oh, I should like to so much.\"  Down they scrambled accordingly, and in another moment were on top of the big rock. It was almost as good as being at sea; for when they turned their backs to the shore nothing could be seen but water and sails and flying birds, and nothing heard but the incessant plash and dash of the waves below.  \"Oh, how perfectly splendid!\" cried Cannie. \"I should think you would come here every day, Gertrude.\"  \"Yes, that's what people always say when they first come,\" said the experienced Gertrude. \"But I assure you we don't come every day, and we don't want to. Why, sometimes last summer I didn't see the Cliffs for weeks and weeks together. It's nice enough now when there are not many people here; but after the season begins and the crowd, it isn't nice at all. You see all sorts of people that you don't know, and--and--well--it isn't pleasant.\"  \"I can't think what you mean,\" declared Cannie, opening her eyes with amazement. \"I'd just as soon there were twenty people on this rock, if I needn't look at them and they didn't talk to me. The sea would be just the same.\"  \"You'll feel differently when you've been in Newport awhile. It's not at all the fashion to walk on the Cliffs now except on Sunday, and not at this end of them even then. A great many people won't bathe, either,--they say it has grown so common. Why, it used to be the thing to walk down here,--all the nicest people did it; and now you never see anybody below Narragansett Avenue except ladies'-maids and butlers, and people who are boarding at the hotels and don't know any better.\"  \"How funny it seems!\" remarked Candace, half to herself, with her eyes on the distance, which was rapidly closing in with mist.  \"What is funny?\"  \"Oh, I was--I was only thinking how funny it is that there should be a fashion about coming down to such a beautiful place as this.\"  \"I don't see how it is funny.\"  \"Yes,\" persisted Candace, who, for all her shyness, had ideas and opinions of her own; \"because the Cliffs are so old and have always been here, and I suppose some of the people who make it the fashion not to walk upon them have only just come to Newport.\"  \"I really think you are the queerest girl I ever saw,\" said Gertrude.  A long silence ensued. Each of the two girls was thinking her own thoughts. The thickening on the horizon meanwhile was increasing. Thin films of vapor began to blow across the sky. The wind stirred and grew chill; the surf on the beach broke with a low roar which had a menacing sound. Suddenly a wall of mist rose and rolled rapidly inland, blotting out all the blue and the smile of sky and sea.  \"Gracious! here's the fog,\" cried Gertrude, \"and I do believe it's going to rain. We must hurry home. I rather think mamma's storm is coming, after all.\"     CHAPTER IV.  THE MANUAL OF PERFECT GENTILITY.   MRS. GRAY'S storm had indeed come. All the next day it rained, and the day after it rained harder, and on the third day came a thick fog; so it was not till the very end of the week that Newport lay again in clear sunshine.  The first of the wet days Cannie spent happily in the society of Miss Evangeline and Mr. Hiawatha, two new acquaintances of whom she felt that she could scarcely see enough. Marian found her sitting absorbed on the staircase bench, and after peeping over her shoulder at the pictures for a while, begged her to read aloud. It was the first little bit of familiar acquaintance which any of the younger members of the Gray family had volunteered, and Candace was much pleased.  Marian was not yet quite fourteen, and was still very much of a child at heart and in her ways. Her \"capable\" little face did not belie her character. She was a born housekeeper, always tidying up and putting away after other people. Everything she attempted she did exactly and well. She was never so happy as when she was allowed to go into the kitchen to make molasses candy or try her hand at cake; and her cake was almost always good, and her candy \"pulled\" to admiration. She was an affectionate child, with a quick sense of fun, and a droll little coaxing manner, which usually won for her her own way, especially from her father, who delighted in her and never could resist Marian's saucy, caressing appeals. It required all Mrs. Gray's firm, judicious discipline to keep her from being spoiled.  Georgie, who was nearly nineteen, seemed younger in some respects than Gertrude, who was but three months older than Candace. Georgie, too, had a good deal of the housekeeper's instinct, but she was rather dreamy and puzzle-headed, and with the best intentions in the world was often led into scrapes and difficulties from her lack of self-reliance, and the easy temper which enabled any one who was much with her to gain an influence over her mind.  Gertrude--but it is less easy to tell what Gertrude was. In fact, it was less important just then to find out what she was than what she was likely to be. Gertrude reminded one of an unripe fruit. The capacities for sweetness and delightfulness were there within her, but all in a crude, undeveloped state. No one could predict as yet whether she would ripen and become mellow and pleasant with time, or remain always half-hard and half-sour, as some fruits do. Meanwhile she was the prettiest though not the most popular of the Gray sisters, and she ruled over Georgie's opinions and ideas with the power which a stronger and more selfish character always has over a weaker and more pliable one.  Marian was less easily influenced. She and Gertrude often came into collision; and it was in part the habit of disputing Gertrude's mandates which led her to seek out Candace on that rainy afternoon. In the privacy of her own room that morning, Gertrude had made some very unflattering remarks about their newly arrived relative.  \"It's really quite dreadful to have a girl like that come to spend the whole summer with one,\" she said to Georgie. \"She hasn't a bit of style, and her clothes are so queer and old-timey; and she's always lived up on that horrid farm, and hasn't an idea beyond it. Everything surprises her so, and she makes such a fuss over it. You should have heard her yesterday when we were out walking; she said the Cliffs had been there always, and some of the fashionable people had only just come.\"  \"What _did_ she mean?\"  \"I'm sure I don't know. She says the queerest things. And she looks so funny and so different from the other girls; and of course everybody will know that she is our cousin.\"  \"Mamma has ordered her some dresses from Hollander's,\" observed Georgie; \"and that was a real pretty hat that came home last night.\"  \"I don't care. They won't look like anything when she puts them on.\"  \"Gertrude Gray, I think it's real mean to talk so about your own cousin,\" cried Marian, who, with the instinct of a true \"little pitcher,\" had heard every word. \"It isn't Cannie's fault that she has always lived on a farm. She didn't have anywhere else to live. Very likely she would have preferred Paris,\" with fine scorn, \"or to go to boarding-school in Dresden, as you and Georgie did, if anybody had given her the choice. She's real nice, I think, and now that her hair is put up, she's pretty too,--a great deal prettier than some of the girls you like. I'm going down now to sit with her. You and Georgie don't treat her kindly a bit. You leave her all alone, and very likely she's homesick at this moment; but I shall be nice to her, whatever you do.\"  Whereupon Miss Marian marched out of the room with her nose in the air, and devoted herself to Candace for the rest of that day, much to the lonely little visitor's contentment.  They grew quite at home with each other over \"Evangeline.\" Birthday books had just come into fashion. Somebody had given Marian one; and she now brought it and asked Candace to write in it.  \"June 17,\" she said, as Cannie sought out the right page; \"why, that is next Saturday.\"  \"So it is, though I shouldn't have remembered it if it hadn't been for your book.\"  \"Why, how funny!\" cried Marian, opening her eyes wide. \"Don't you keep your birthdays?\"  \"Keep them?\" repeated Candace, in a tone of perplexity.  \"Yes; keep--celebrate them? Don't people ever give you presents? Didn't you ever have a cake?\"--her voice increasing in dismay, as Candace in answer to each question shook her head.  \"Cake--on my birthday, you mean? No, I don't think I ever did. Aunt Myra doesn't believe in cake. She says she liked it when she was young; but since she was converted to cracked wheat and oatmeal at the age of thirty-three, she has hardly ever touched it. We never had any at North Tolland, except gingerbread sometimes.\"  \"What a dreadful kind of aunt for a girl to have!\" remarked Marian, meditatively. She sat for some time longer on the floor, with her head on Candace's knee; but she seemed to be thinking deeply about something, and said she didn't feel like being read to any longer. At last she went away \"to speak to mamma,\" she said.  Candace had forgotten all about this birthday discussion before Saturday morning dawned dimly out of the still persistent fog. All the time she was dressing, her eyes were on \"The Golden Legend\" which lay open on the bureau beside her; and her thoughts were so much occupied with Prince Henry and poor pretty Elsie, for whom she felt so very sorry, that she had none to spare for the comparatively unimportant fact that she, little Candace Arden, had that day turned the corner of her seventeenth year.  It was all the more a delightful surprise, therefore, when she went down to breakfast and found a pile of dainty, white, ribbon-tied parcels on her plate, a glass of beautiful roses beside it, and was met with a special kiss from Cousin Kate, and a chorus of \"Many happy returns\" from the rest of the family.  The little softnesses and prettinesses of life, the gifts and surprises, the sweet words, the being made much of on special occasions, were quite unknown to the old farm-house in North Tolland. Aunt Myra was a stanch Presbyterian. She disapproved on principle of Christmas day, as belonging to popery and old superstition. She didn't see that one day was any better than any other day. It was just an accident on what day of the year you were born, and it was no use to make a fuss about it, she said. There were plenty of people in the world before you came, and there would have been plenty if you had never come at all. Such was Aunt Myra's _dictum_.  With these views, it may be supposed that Candace's idea of an anniversary was not a very lively one. For a moment she scarcely took in the meaning of what she saw, but stood regarding the plate-ful of parcels with a bewildered look on her face.  \"It's your birthday, you know,\" exclaimed little Marian. \"Many happy returns! Don't you recollect that it's your birthday? We shouldn't have found it out, though, if it hadn't been for my book.\"  \"I'm not so sure about that,\" said Mrs. Gray, smiling at her. \"I had the date of Cannie's birthday put down securely somewhere, and I've been keeping a special gift for it. It's something that I brought you from Geneva, Cannie; but as it had waited so long before getting to you, I thought it might as well wait a little longer and come on your anniversary.\"  \"Oh, thank you,\" said Candace, glancing shyly at the parcels.  \"Please do begin to open them!\" urged Marian. \"It is such fun to see people open presents. That's mamma's; open it first.\"  It was a flat squarish bundle, tied with a rose-colored ribbon. Cannie's fingers shook with excitement as she undid the knot. Breakfast meantime was at a stand-still. The girls were peeping over her shoulders, Mr. Gray watching from behind his newspaper; even Frederic, with a plate of hot toast in his hand, had paused, and out of one discreet eye was observing her movements.  Inside was a flat case of gray polished wood, with a little silver ornament in the middle. It opened with a snap. Cannie pressed the spring, the lid flew up, and there, on a cushion of blue velvet, lay the prettiest little Swiss watch imaginable, with C. V. A. enamelled on its lid. There was a slender gold chain attached, a little enamelled key,--nothing could be more complete.  \"A watch! for me! to be my own!\" cried Candace, hardly able to believe her eyes. \"I never thought I should have a watch, and such a darling beauty as this. Oh, Cousin Kate!\"  \"I am glad it pleases you,\" said her cousin, with another kiss. \"You should have had it two years ago; but I thought you rather young to be trusted with a watch then, so I kept it till we should meet.\"  \"Oh, do make haste and open another! It's such fun to see you,\" pleaded Marian.  One by one, the other parcels were unfastened. There was a little ring of twisted gold from Georgie, a sachet of braided ribbons, dark and light blue, from Gertrude, a slender silver bangle from Marian, and from Mr. Gray a long roll of tissue paper in which lay six pairs of undressed kid gloves in pretty shades of tan color and pale yellow. There was besides a big box of candy. This, Mr. Gray declared, was his real present. Cousin Kate was responsible for the gloves, but he knew very well that there never yet was a girl of seventeen who did not have a sweet tooth ready for a sugar-plum.  One bundle remained. It was tied with pink packthread instead of ribbon. Cannie undid the string. It was a book, not new, bound in faded brown; and the title printed on the back was \"The Ladies' Manual of Perfect Gentility.\"  \"Who on earth gave you that?\" demanded Marian.  Mrs. Gray looked surprised and not very well pleased.  \"It is a joke, I suppose,\" she said. \"Georgie, Gertrude,--which of you has been amusing yourself in this odd way?\"  \"Not I, mamma,\" said Georgie. Gertrude felt the reproof in her mother's manner, but she tried to laugh the matter off.  \"Oh, I put it there just for fun,\" she said. \"I thought the more parcels the better, and I happened to see that queer old thing, and thought it would make Cannie laugh.\"  This explanation was not quite sincere. Gertrude had put the book on the table, hoping to tease Cannie. She had overheard something which her mother was telling Candace the day before,--an explanation about some little point of manners,--and it had suggested the idea of the old volume. Her shaft had missed its mark somehow, or, like the boomerangs used by the Australian blacks, had returned again to the hand that aimed it; for Cannie did not seem to mind at all, and Mrs. Gray, though she said no more at the moment, was evidently meditating a lecture. It came after breakfast, and was unexpectedly severe, hurting Gertrude a great deal more than her maliciously intended gift had hurt Candace.  \"You are inclined to despise your cousin as countrified and unused to society,\" said Mrs. Gray. \"I grant that she is not up in all the little social rules; but let me tell you, Gertrude, that Cannie has the true instinct of ladyhood in her, and after the occurrence of this morning I am beginning to fear that you have not. Good manners are based on good feeling. Cannie may be shy and awkward; she may not know how to face a room full of strangers gracefully,--such things are not hard to learn, and she will learn them in time; but of one thing I am very sure, and that is, that if you were her guest at North Tolland instead of her being yours at Newport, she would be quite incapable of any rudeness however slight, or of trying to make you uncomfortable in any way. I wish I could say the same of you, Gertrude. I am disappointed in you, my child.\"  \"Oh, mamma, don't speak so!\" cried Gertrude, almost ready to cry; for she admired her mother as well as loved her, and was cravingly desirous to win her good opinion. \"Please don't think I meant to be rude. It really and truly was a joke.\"  \"My dear, you meant a little more by it than that,\" replied Mrs. Gray, fixing her soft, penetrating look on Gertrude's face. \"You haven't begun quite rightly with Candace. I have noticed it, and have been sorry,--sorry for you even more than for her. She is an affectionate, true-hearted girl. You can make a good friend of her if you will; and you can be of use to her and she to you.\"  \"Now, what did mamma mean by that?\" thought Gertrude, after she had gone upstairs. \"I can't, for the life of me, see what use Cannie could be to me. I might to her, perhaps, if I wanted to.\"  The \"Manual of Perfect Gentility\" was destined to excite more attention than its donor had intended, in more ways than one. Candace and Marian fell to reading it, and found its contents so amusing that they carried it to the morning-room, where Georgie was taking a lesson in china-painting from her mother, who was very clever at all the minor art accomplishments. Gertrude came in at the same time, in search of some crewels to match an embroidery pattern; so they were all together.  \"Mamma, mamma, please listen to this!\" cried Marian, and she read:--            \"'_Directions for entering the room at an evening           party._--Fix your eye on the lady of the house on           entering, and advance toward her with           outstretched hand, looking neither to the right           nor to the left, until you have interchanged the           ordinary salutations of the occasion. When this is           done, turn aside and mingle with the other           guests.'  Now, mamma, just imagine it,--marching in with your hand out and your eye fixed!\" And Marian, relinquishing the Manual to Cannie, flew to the door, and entered in the manner prescribed, with her eyes set in a stony glare on her mother's face, and her hand held before her as stiffly as if it had been a shingle. No one could help laughing.  \"I don't think the hand and the glare are necessary,\" said Mrs. Gray; \"but it is certainly quite proper to speak to the lady of the house, when you come in, before you begin to talk to other people.\"  \"Here's another,\" cried Marian, hardly waiting till her mother had done speaking. \"Just listen to these--            \"'_Directions for a horseback ride.           Mounting._--The lady should stand on the left side           of the horse, with her right hand on the pommel of           her saddle, and rest her left foot lightly on the           shoulder of her gentleman attendant, who bends           before her. When this is done, the gentleman will           slowly raise himself to the perpendicular           position, and in doing so lift the lady without           difficulty to the level of her seat.'\"  \"My gracious! suppose he didn't,\" remarked Georgie, looking up from her painting. \"There she would be, standing on his shoulder, on one foot! Imagine it, on the Avenue!\" And the four girls united in a peal of laughter.  \"But there is something here that I really want to know about,\" said Candace. \"May I read it to you, Cousin Kate? It's in a chapter called 'Correspondence.'\"  \"Oh, my!\" cried Marian, who still held fast to one side of the Manual. \"It tells how to refuse gentlemen when they offer themselves to you. Here it all is. You must say,--            \"'SIR,--I regret extremely if anything in my           manner has led to a misapprehension of my true           feelings. I do not experience for you the           affection which alone can make the marriage           relation a happy one; so I--'\"  \"No, no,\" interrupted Candace, blushing very pink, and pulling the book away from Marian; \"that isn't at all what I wanted to ask you about, Cousin Kate. It was--\"  \"Oh, then perhaps you meant to accept him,\" went on the incorrigible Marian, again getting possession of one side of the \"Manual of Gentility.\" \"Here you are:--            \"'DEAR FRIEND,--Your letter has made me truly           happy, breathing, as it does, expressions of deep           and heartfelt affection, of which I have long felt           the corresponding sentiments. I shall be happy to           receive you in my home as an accepted suitor, and           I--'\"  \"Cousin Kate, make her stop--isn't she too bad?\" said Cannie, vainly struggling for the possession of the book.  \"'And I'--let me see, where was I when you interrupted?\" went on Marian. \"Oh, yes, here--            \"'And I am sure that my parents will give their           hearty consent to our union. Receive my thanks for           your assurances, and believe--'\"  But Candace had again got hold of the volume, and no one ever learned the end of the letter, or what the lover of this obliging lady was to \"believe.\"  \"_This_ is what I wanted to ask you about, Cousin Kate,\" said Candace, when quiet was restored. \"The book says:--            \"'The signature of a letter should depend upon the           degree of familiarity existing between the writer           and the person addressed. For instance, in writing           to a perfect stranger a lady would naturally use           the form,--                                  Yours truly,                                    Mrs. A. M. Cotterell.'\"  \"Oh! oh!\" interrupted Georgie. \"Fancy any one signing herself 'Yours truly, Mrs. A. M. Cotterell.' It's awfully vulgar, isn't it mamma?\"  \"That is a very old-fashioned book,\" observed Mrs. Gray; \"still I don't think, even at the time when it was published, that well-bred people used a signature like that. It may not be 'awfully vulgar,' but it certainly is not correct; nothing but the Christian name should ever be used as a signature.\"  \"But suppose the person you were writing to did not know whether you were married or not,\" said Candace.  \"Then you can add your address below, like this;\" and she wrote on the edge of her drawing-paper,--                                              \"Yours truly,                                                   \"CATHERINE V. GRAY.   \"MRS. COURTENAY GRAY,      \"Newport, R. I.  That is what I should do if I were writing to a stranger.\"  \"Then there is this about the addresses of letters,\" went on Candace:--            \"'In addressing a married lady, use her maiden as           well as her married name; for example, in writing           to Miss Sarah J. Beebe, who is married to George           Gordon, the proper direction would be                             Mrs. Sarah B. Gordon,                                  Care of George Gordon,                                         Oshkosh,                                             Michigan.'  Is that right, Cousin Kate?\"  \"No; that is decidedly _wrong_. When Miss Beebe married, she became not only Mrs. Gordon, but Mrs. George Gordon, to distinguish her from any other Mrs. Gordons who might happen to exist. She should _sign_ herself 'Sarah B. Gordon,' but her letters and cards should bear her married name, 'Mrs. George Gordon.'\"  \"But people do write to widows in that way, don't they?\" asked Gertrude. \"I recollect, when I went to the post-office with Berry Joy one day, there was a letter for her mother, directed to Mrs. Louisa Bailey Joy.\"  \"Yes; people do, but not the people who know the right way,\" her mother replied dryly. \"A man's Christian name doesn't die with him any more than his surname. I often see letters addressed to Mrs. Jane this and Mrs. Maria that, but it never seems to me either correct or elegant. It is a purely American custom. English people have never adopted it, and it seems very odd to them.\"  \"Well, about cards,\" continued Marian, who was turning over the leaves of the \"Manual of Gentility.\" \"See what a funny little card this is; and the writer of the book says it is the kind we ought to have.\" She pointed to a page on which appeared a little oblong enclosure bearing the name            +----------------------+           |                      |           |  _Fannie C. Jones._  |           |                      |           +----------------------+  \"That isn't nice a bit, is it, mamma?\"  \"No, I confess that it does not look to me at all right. Girls old enough to need cards are old enough to have 'handles to their names.' If I were that young woman I should spell 'Fanny' without the _ie_, and call myself 'Miss Frances C. Jones' on my card, and keep my pet name for the use of my friends, and not print it.\"  \"I think I've learned a good deal to-day,\" said Candace. \"The funny old book isn't right in what it says, but Cousin Kate knows; so it comes to the same thing in the end. I'm glad you gave it to me, Gertrude.\"  Gertrude had the grace to feel ashamed, as she saw Candace's perfect freedom from shame.  \"Oh, dear! how much there is to learn!\" continued Candace, with a sigh. She was still deep in the \"Ladies' Manual of Perfect Gentility.\"  \"Put away that book, Cannie,\" said her cousin; \"or give it to me, and I will hide it where Gertrude shall not find it again. Good breeding can be learned without printed rules.\"  \"Can it, mamma?\"  \"Yes; for, as I was saying this morning to Gertrude, good manners are the result of good feeling. If we really care about other people, and want to make them happy, and think of them and not of ourselves, we shall instinctively do what will seem pleasant to them, and avoid doing what is disagreeable. We shall refrain from interrupting them when they are speaking. We shall not half listen to what they say, while our eyes are roving about the room, and our attention wandering to other things. We shall be quick to notice if they want anything that we can get for them. We shall not answer at random, or giggle, or say the wrong thing. We shall not loll back in our chairs, as Georgie is doing at this moment, with one foot cocked over the other knee, and a paint-brush in our mouths.\"  \"Mamma!\" And Georgie hastily recovered the upright position, and took her paint-brush from between her lips.  \"We shall not drum idly on window-panes, as Gertrude was doing just now, for fear that the little noise will be disagreeable to our neighbors.\"  \"Now, mamma!\"  \"We shall not walk carelessly between any one and the fire, because we shall be afraid of making them cold; nor shall we upset a work-basket while doing so, as Marian upset mine just now.\"  \"Mamma, I do believe you are giving us all a scolding; I shall just stop you.\" And Marian flung her arms round her mother's neck, and gave her half a dozen enormous kisses.  \"We shall consider a kiss as a favor,\" went on Mrs. Gray, inexorably, holding Marian off at arm's length, \"not a punishment to be inflicted whenever we happen to feel like it. We shall never trot one foot when we are nervous, and shake the table.\"  \"Cannie, that's you. I thought it would be your turn soon,\" said Marian.  \"Oh! did I trot?\" said Cannie. \"Please excuse me, Cousin Kate. I have such a bad habit of doing that. Aunt Myra says it's my safety-valve.\"  \"If it's a safety-valve, it's all very well,\" replied her cousin. \"I didn't know. In short, my dears, as the poet says,--            'Manners are not idle, but the fruit            Of noble nature and of lofty mind.'  The instinct of self-control, of gentleness, of consideration and forethought and quick sympathy, which go to make up what we call good breeding; the absence of noise and hurry, the thousand and one little ways by which we can please people, or avoid displeasing them,--are all taught us by our own hearts. Good manners are the fine flower of civilization. And everybody can have them. I always say that one of the best-bred men of my acquaintance is Mr. Jarvis, the mason. I have known him come up out of a cistern to speak to me, dressed in overalls and a flannel shirt; and his bow and his manner and the politeness of his address would have done credit to any gentleman in the world.\"  \"Mamma, how funny you are,\" said Georgie, wonderingly; but Gertrude caught her mother's meaning more clearly.  \"I rather like it,\" she said slowly. \"It sounds like something in a poem or a storybook, and it would be nice if everybody felt like that, but people don't. I've heard Mrs. Joy speak quite rudely to Mr. Jarvis, mamma.\"  \"Very likely. I never have considered Mrs. Joy as a model of manners,\" replied Mrs. Gray, coolly. \"And that reminds me to say just one other word about good breeding toward servants and people who work for us, or are poor and need our help. Gentleness and politeness are even more important with them than they are with other people.\"  \"Why more, mamma?\"  \"Because their lives are harder than ours, and we owe them all the little help that courtesy can give. Because, too, we are their models, consciously or unconsciously, and if we are polite to them they will in return be polite to us. And besides, they meet us at a disadvantage. If a servant 'answers back,' she is called impertinent and discharged; but I should think it must be rather hard _not_ to answer back to some mistresses.\"  \"Is that why you are always so very polite to Jane?\" asked Gertrude. Jane was the cook.  \"Yes, partly that; and partly because I want Jane to be very polite to me; and she always is.\"  \"There is the sun at last, I do declare,\" cried Marian, springing up. \"Hurrah! I should think it was time. Now we shall have some nice weather, Cannie. Newport is lovely after a fog. It looks so nicely washed, and so green. Mamma, couldn't we have a long drive this afternoon in the wagonette, across the beaches and way round by the windmill? I like that drive so much.\"  \"Yes; and at dinner we will eat Cannie's health in her birthday cake. It is making now, and Jane has the seventeen little pink candles all ready. How the fog is rolling away! It will be a charming afternoon.\"     CHAPTER V.  DOWN TO BEAVER TAIL.   SUNDAY morning brought the fresh, lovely stillness which Sundays in early summer seem always to possess in Newport. Later in the season the roll of wheels and the jingle of plated harnesses come to mar this peacefulness; but till the very end of June it endures, and is one of the sweet things of the place.  The Joys were at breakfast. It was one of the points in which Mrs. Joy took most pride, that this meal was served in a special apartment known as the breakfast-room, and not, as with most families, in the room where they dined. The breakfast-room was not large, but sumptuous in all its appointments. A critical taste might have objected that the plush curtains which shaded the windows were too heavy for summer; that the begilded wallpaper \"swore\" a little at its own dado and frieze, as well as deadened the effect of the pictures which hung against it; and that the drapery of lace and velvet which veiled the fireplace made a fire inconvenient and almost impossible, however cold the weather might be. But a critical taste might have found the same faults with the whole house. The general effect was of costliness and magnificence; but the details were at variance, and comfort and homelikeness had been sacrificed in the effort to make everything fine. There was a library, with almost no books in it; a ball-room, which was used only for balls, and looked bare and shut up on ordinary days; a huge drawing-room, full of costly toys,--tables loaded with Svres cups, other tables with processions of pug-dogs in precious china, snuff-boxes, patch-boxes; chimney-piece crowded with porcelain figures and bits of old Dresden ware; there was a great deal of carving and _or-moulu_,--but it all had the air of being created and kept for company use, and deserted the moment company went away. Mrs. Joy had only got so far in her art education as this, that she bought everything which cost a great deal of money and which her neighbors bought, and she never stopped to reason about such minor points as taste, fitness, convenience, or the adaptation of an article to her own particular needs.  Mrs. Joy was the very image of a prosperous woman, as she sat behind her heavy silver coffee-pots and cream-jugs, reading the Sunday paper, to get which her groom had ridden a couple of miles before breakfast. Her very black hair was trained into a line of formal rings across her forehead, which as yet scarcely showed a wrinkle. Her tightly laced figure was almost as slender as her daughter's; and the hand sparkling with diamonds, which held the paper, was white and youthful. Handsome she certainly was; and people called her agreeable, for she talked a great deal, in a noisy, lively way, and had a caressing manner for all persons whom she thought it worth her while to caress. But her face was hard; and when the society smile died out of it, it was neither intelligent nor kindly. Mrs. Joy had been extremely pretty in her youth. Berenice was like her; but Tom Joy the son resembled his father, who had died three or four years before the opening of this little story.  Berry and her friend Ethel Curtis were talking about a sailing party which they had planned for the next day.  \"The Grays and the Halletts, and Julia Prime, that makes seven; mamma for matron, eight; then there's Tom and George Rivington, and the two Fosters. I can't think where we are to get the other three men.\"  \"It isn't like a dinner party. The numbers need not be exactly equal,\" suggested Ethel.  \"That's true, but it's a great deal better fun to have them equal. Men hate to talk to two girls at once, and the girls who haven't any men to talk to feel left out. Carrol Benton is coming up the end of the week; I wish he were here now.\"  \"I guess you'd better look up some other matron, and let me off,\" said Mrs. Joy, laying down her newspaper. \"I don't care much for sailing. I'm so apt to feel a little sick, and that spoils all the pleasure of it. Ask Mrs. Freddy Allen; she is young, and likes to go everywhere, and Freddy will go along and make another gentleman.\"  \"That will do nicely if you really don't want to go, mamma. We'll invite them all as we come out of church, and save the bother of writing notes. It's easier to explain when you see people than to write down everything.\"  \"Yes, that's one of the conveniences of going to church,\" remarked Mrs. Joy, calmly. \"I've often had as many as three or four invitations, coming out of Trinity on a Sunday morning in the season. These muffins are horrid. James, tell the cook she ought to be ashamed of herself to send up such things. They're as tough as leather, and burned besides--as black as my shoe, I do declare.\"  \"Yes, 'm.\"  And James departed to incense the cook with the unsoftened message. The cook declared that when ladies came down an hour late for breakfast, they must expect tough muffins; and for her part she didn't care whether they were good or not; she didn't think much of the place anyway, and didn't mean to stay on. There'd be plenty of people coming in a week or two, and plenty of places to pick and choose from. Mrs. Joy was always having little difficulties with her servants.  Trinity Church looked cool and shady, as the party entered it from the dazzle of the outer sunshine. Berenice Joy was perfectly well-trained in the outward forms of devotion. She called herself \"High Church;\" and nothing could be more graceful than the manner in which she glided up the aisle, bowed to the chancel, and sank on her knees, for what was supposed to be a short interval of silent prayer. But her eyes went straight to the Grays' pew the moment she rose, and from thence to the Halletts', and she whispered to Ethel, \"They're all here. That's nice.\" Then she indulged in a long stare at Candace, who had come to church with her cousins, and who, in her new cream-and-brown foulard, with the daisy-trimmed hat, and a pair of the birthday gloves on her slender hands, looked quite differently from the ill-dressed little passenger of the \"Eolus\" the Monday before.  \"Do look! That's the very girl we saw on the boat,\" went on Berenice, in the same low whisper. \"Did you ever! Hasn't Mrs. Gray done her over nicely? I wonder where she got that hat?\"  \"I wonder what she has done with the old one?\"  \"Given it to the cook, or sold it to the rag-and-bottle man,\" retorted Berry. Then came a suppressed giggle, which ended in sudden, forced gravity as the opening words of the service fell on their ears, and they rose with the rest of the congregation.  Candace was not conscious that she was being looked at. She had only once or twice in her life been in an Episcopal church, and never before in an old one. Trinity seemed to her as wonderful and picturesque as some of the churches she had read about in books. She looked at the square pews where people sat sideways, instead of fronting the chancel as in ordinary churches. She noted the tall wands with gilded tops, which marked the places of the junior and senior wardens; the quaint, swinging chandeliers of old brass; the tablets on the walls, two or three bearing inscriptions in honor of dead rectors or other departed worthies, one to the memory of a young girl, with a beautiful flying figure in bas-relief, carved in white marble. She gazed with amazement at the pulpit,--one of the ancient \"three-decker\" pattern, which is rarely seen now-a-days, with a clerk's desk below, a reading-desk above, above that a lofty pulpit for the clergyman, to which a narrow flight of stairs gave access, and suspended over all an enormous extinguisher-shaped sounding-board. It looked large and heavy enough to crush any clergyman who should be caught by its fall while in act of preaching; and Candace watched its slight oscillations with an apprehensive fascination, till she recollected that it must have hung there for a hundred years at least, so there was no reason to suppose that it would drop on this particular Sunday.  By turning her head a very little she could get a glimpse of the organ-loft, with its quaint little organ bearing two gilded mitres and a royal crown on top, and below, the inscription, \"The Gift of George Berkeley, late Lord Bishop of Cloyne.\" She wondered who George Berkeley could have been, and resolved to ask Cousin Kate as they went home if there was any story about him.  There was no whispering or giggling in Mrs. Gray's pew. The girls were too well trained for such irreverence; and except that Georgie interchanged one little smile with Berry Joy as she came in, not one of them looked away from the clergyman till the sermon was over and the benediction pronounced. It had been an impressive service to Candace, who was used to the barer forms of the Congregational church; and she was surprised to perceive how little solemnizing effect it seemed to have on the congregation in general.  The moment people rose from their knees, a low buzz of conversation began. Berry Joy seized on Georgie and Gertrude, and began to unfold the sailing plan as they walked down the aisle. Mrs. Joy took possession of Cousin Kate. Everybody seemed to have something to say to somebody. Candace caught scraps of half-a-dozen different conversations before she reached the door, and not one of them related in any way to the sermon or to anything religious. She overheard one invitation to dinner, another to drive, an inquiry about a dressmaker, a bit of gossip about a new engagement, a request for a recipe for mayonnaise. She supposed it must be the right thing to chatter thus, since all these delightful-looking people did it; still it seemed to her country notions rather queer.  The carriage was waiting in Spring Street, a little farther up the hill. She did not like to get in till the others were ready, so she stepped aside among the gravestones, and looked up to where the white, slender spire of the old church towered against the blue. She was trying to make out the Episcopal mitre surmounted by the gilded weather-vane, when Mrs. Gray saw and beckoned to her.  She was still talking with Mrs. Joy, and that lady was saying, \"I may possibly not be able to go myself, but if I am prevented I will see that the young folks have a proper matron. And then, my dear, there's Captain Davis, you know. I never let Berry sail with any one else. He's so safe and so careful, and the weather promises to be perfect.\"  \"It certainly is perfect to-day,\" said Mrs. Gray. \"Candace dear, I want to introduce you to Mrs. Joy. My cousin, Miss Arden, Mrs. Joy; or rather my niece, for her mother was like my own sister. She has come to spend the summer with me. Cannie, Mrs. Joy is the mother of the young lady who came down with you in the 'Eolus.'\"  \"Ah, indeed, the girls did not tell me about that,\" said Mrs. Joy. \"Well, my dear,\"--Mrs. Joy would have said \"my dear\" to Queen Victoria or the Empress of China, if she had ever had the chance of an interview with those potentates,--\"you've come to a charming place and to charming relatives, I'm sure, and you can't fail to enjoy your summer. You must come with your cousins to-morrow to this sailing-party which my young folks are getting up. They'll be delighted, I'm sure.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Candace, timidly, glancing at Mrs. Gray.  \"That will be very nice,\" said her cousin. \"Cannie has not been on the water yet. It is a new pleasure for her. At four o'clock, you said, Mrs. Joy?\"  \"Yes, dear, at four. And don't trouble to send down for the girls. It's impossible to tell exactly when they will get in, as it depends on the wind, and Berry will have the beach-wagon, and can bring them all up as well as not. Good-by, dear.\" And Mrs. Joy sailed toward her carriage, where the two girls were already seated.  \"I've asked that Miss Arden who's staying with the Grays to go out sailing with you to-morrow,\" she said, as she took her seat. \"You'll want another gentleman, Berry.\"  \"Oh, mamma, what _did_ you do that for? She's the pokiest little thing. We didn't want her at all.\"  \"Well, Mrs. Gray introduced her, and said she was almost her niece, and I thought it seemed to be expected. Mrs. Gray is always polite to our visitors, you know, and I don't like to seem to slight any of hers. What's the matter with the girl?\"  \"Oh, nothing's the matter, only she's poky, and doesn't seem to fit in somehow. You would understand if you had seen her the day she came. Mrs. Gray has dressed her up, as you might be sure she would; but then she looked like the backwoods, didn't she, Ethel?\"  \"She seemed nice-appearing enough to-day. You'll have to make the best you can of it, I guess; for Mrs. Gray accepted for her.\"  \"It doesn't really signify,\" said Berry, discontentedly; \"only it throws the party all out of shape. And she's younger than any of the rest, only just seventeen, Georgie says. She'd a great deal better stay at home with Marian.\"  It was fortunate that Candace did not guess how unwelcome her company was to the getters-up of the party, for the idea of the sail was most delightful to her. She had never been out in a boat in her life, not even on the smallest pond; and she had just discovered the strong fascination of the sea. She longed to get nearer to it, to know it better; and in her innocent little heart she thought, \"How very kind it was in Mrs. Joy to invite me.\"  Sunday was always a particularly pleasant day at the Grays'. Mrs. Gray was wont to declare that though she did not believe in the Jewish Sabbath, she did with all her heart believe in the Christian day of rest; and she took pains to make it a happy one for all under her roof. She gave her servants as much liberty as she could, simplified their work, and provided a plenty of good reading for such of them as stayed at home. Her own time was much more at the service of her family than it could be on ordinary days. She always took a walk with the girls in the cool of the afternoon, if the day were pleasant, and kept some book of a thoughtful kind to read aloud in the evenings. This Sunday it happened to be that wonderful little prose poem of Mrs. Oliphant's, \"A Beleaguered City.\" Cannie found it absorbingly interesting, and even Mr. Gray laid aside his newspaper and listened to the very end.  The reading done, Candace found a chance to ask her question about George Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne, the donor of the organ. There was a story about him, as it turned out, and a very interesting one. Mrs. Gray told how, when Dean of Derry in Ireland, the project of establishing a college in Bermuda for the education of English boys and of Indian youths to act as missionaries to their own people, had taken possession of his mind; and he had given up his preferment, and crossed the sea with his family to engage in this chosen work. She described their landing in Newport on a Sunday morning when everybody was at church, and how the clergyman stopped in the middle of his sermon, and with all his congregation following him, hurried down to the water-side to receive the distinguished guest. She promised to take Candace out some day to see Whitehall,--the house which he built on the island, and in which he lived for some years, till the impossibility of carrying out his scheme for Bermuda drove him back again to Ireland; and also the rocky shelf still called \"Bishop Berkeley's Rock,\" where he is said to have composed the lines which begin            \"Westward the course of empire takes its way.\"  Then she looked up a photograph from Smibert's picture of Dean Berkeley and his family to show them, and by that time the girls had all grown interested; and when Marian said that she, too, wanted to go to see Whitehall, Georgie and Gertrude begged to be included also, and Mrs. Gray promised to take them all.  \"One of the Dean's little children is buried in Trinity churchyard, Cannie,\" she ended; \"you can look up the stone some day. It has 'Lucia Berkeley' carved upon it.\"  \"I should like to,\" said Cannie. \"It has been so nice to hear about him. How many interesting things have happened in Newport! I shall care a great deal more about that funny little organ, next Sunday.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Newport Harbor shone all blue and silver in the sun, as the party stepped on board the cat-boat \"Cornelia\" at sharp four on Monday afternoon. Mrs. Fred Allen, a tall, graceful brunette, seemed as much of a girl as any of the party which she was nominally to \"matronize;\" but \"she _was_ married though she didn't look it,\" as Berry Joy remarked, and so was qualified to fill the place. There was a fair wind, which sent the boat smoothly along with little or no motion as they glided past the long sunken shoal off the end of Goat Island, and opened the view of Brenton's Cove, with the wreck of the old slaver lying in the deep shadow under one bank, opposite the ribs of the other stranded bark; while from beyond in the laughing bay, white-winged boats flitted to and fro, and seemed to beckon and make tempting signals to the poor defeated barks who might never sail or enjoy the sea again. Candace ventured to ask Gertrude in a whisper, \"What are those?\"  \"Oh, only some old wrecks,\" replied Gertrude, carelessly; and she turned from Candace to talk to Tom Joy, who sat next to her.  The \"Cornelia\" was now running on the favoring wind between Fort Adams and the Conanicut shore. On one hand lay Newport, which looked like a dream city in the soft shine of the afternoon; on the other was the long hill line of the island, green with grasses, except where broken now and then by rocky cliffs, and indented with innumerable little coves and inlets,--some ending in strips of pebbly beach, others in stony shelves overhung by sea-weeds. The water was beautiful in color,--here pale flashing green, there purple in the shadow, with gleams of golden light and a low reach of shimmering blue toward the horizon. On sped the boat till they could almost touch the ledges. The rounded outline of the old fortification on the upper hill towered above their heads. Then suddenly she curved and wheeled off on the other tack, with the sharp line of Castle Hill and the Agassiz Point full in view.  Candace gazed with delighted eyes to left and right. Her mind was full of questions, but there seemed no one of whom she could ask them. Georgie and Berry were perched on the extreme point of the bow, with a young man stretched at their feet. Mrs. Fred was on the cabin roof amidships, with quite a little court of girls and young men about her. The couples who sat opposite and beside her seemed quite absorbed in each other. No one had spoken to Candace since the first introductions, and she was too shy to open a conversation with anybody.  \"How I wish I knew!\" she sighed to herself, half aloud.  Looking up, she met the shrewd, twinkling eyes of the Captain. Perhaps he had caught the words, for he asked encouragingly, \"Did you speak, Miss?\"  \"No,\" said Candace, \"I don't think I spoke. But I was wondering about that--that--_thing_ up there,\" pointing to the Fort.  \"That? That's Fort Dumpling, as folks call it. It is a kind of a queer old place, ain't it? They don't use it now for no war purposes, but it makes a pretty p'int in the landscape, and folks go there for picnics and such in the summer season.\"  \"When was it built?\" asked Candace, charmed to find somebody able and willing to satisfy her curiosity.  \"Wa'al, I reckon it was about 1812, when we was a-tackling the British for the last time. 'Tain't very much of a fort to look at; but if you was to mount some of them powerful guns they make now on the walls, them and the others over at Fort Adams yonder would protect the channel pretty well. The shot'd reach clear across. Why, you hardly think it perhaps, but not more'n four or five years ago, there was some folks who had come on a kind of an excursion, taking their lunches up there by Fort Dumpling, and some soldiers was firing at a long-range target over there to Fort Adams, and one of the balls came over and hit a young lady.\"  \"How dreadful!\" said Candace, her eyes measuring the long distance between the two points. \"And it seems so far away. I suppose the young lady felt perfectly safe. I am sure I should have. Did it kill her?\"  \"Oh, no! they thought at first it had, but it didn't turn out so bad as was expected. The soldiers, they felt mighty mean, I expect. You see, they didn't intend a mite of harm to her or anybody; but it just shows how far them big guns carry now-a-days. A war-ship now, unless she was some kind of a monitor or that, would stand a fair chance of being stove and sent to the bottom before she could get in to attack Newport.\"  \"What a fanny little house that is close down to the water!\" remarked Candace, looking off to the opposite shore.  \"That's Professor Agassiz's laboratory. Do y' see that kind of a cove which sets in there near by the building, and a little black thing sticking up out of it? That's the pipe of his steam-launch. He and the rest go out in it and dredge for fish and such like, and then they experiment on them inside.\"  \"What do they do that for?\" asked Candace.  \"Wa'al, they want to find out about 'em, I reckon. I was in there once and saw them at work, but I couldn't make nothing out of it, and there wasn't anybody I could ask.\"  \"Oh, what is that?\" cried Candace, as the \"Cornelia,\" tacking again, opened one of the little bays on the south end of Conanicut, where a small steam vessel was lying. Two boats, which seemed to belong to her, were rowing in a parallel line with each other, and behind them appeared a long line of bobbing points which she could not at all understand.  \"That's one of the fishing steamers, and the boats are drawing her nets,\" explained the Captain. \"Didn't you ever see a seine drawn before? Wa'al, I declare! I'm mighty glad we happened just in time, for it's a cur'us spectacle. I guess we'll kind of hang about till they get the nets in, and then I'll take the 'Cornelia' up near enough for you to see.\"  \"Captain, there are the seine-boats out,\" called Tom Joy at the same moment. \"Let's sail up and see what they've caught.\"  The two boats began to near each other as they reached the limits of the long elliptical curves which made their course; and presently a great number of scintillating specks were seen in the space enclosed between them. There were the leaping fish, just conscious that they were crowded into a confined place, and desirous of escape. When they were quite close to one another, the boats turned and began to row for the steamer. The \"Cornelia\" followed; and the Captain with a twist of the tiller threw her into the wind just beyond the great net, which by that time was being rapidly hauled in.  It was a wonderful thing to see,--the heavy mass of floundering fishes pouring over into the steamer's hold. Thousands and thousands of quivering silvery shapes of all kinds, from the fat, oily-bodied menhaden, to weird horned monsters with gaping mouths, and strange, half-translucent blocks like jelly, which seemed to have no mouths at all. Large and small, pinky white, black, blue,--in they poured. Now and then some fish more lucky than his fellows would splash over the side of the net and escape to liberty and the deep sea; now and then a fisherman with a sudden dash of his hand would single out a specimen choicer than the rest, a blue-fish, a chicken cod, or a sea-bass.  The little company in the sail-boat shared all the excitement of the catch. The young men left their flirtations for the boat's side, where they could get a better view. A great deal of chaff went on between Captain Davis and the captain of the menhaden steamer. Tom Joy amused himself by bargaining for blue-fish, and actually bought three big flapping specimens for a dollar and a quarter. They were deposited on the bottom of the \"Cornelia,\" where they leaped painfully up and down, while the girls retreated for refuge to the upper deck, till Captain Davis at last caught the fish and stowed them away in his little cabin. It was not till the last loop of the seine was emptied, the last fish secured, and the boats were making ready for another cast, that the \"Cornelia\" finally glided away; and by that time a soft crimson glow had gathered in the west and the sun was nearing the horizon edge. The wind blew more freshly now, and with a zest and coolness which it had not had earlier in the afternoon.  Captain Davis pointed out to Candace the light-ship anchored in the offing between Point Judith and Brenton's Reef, and told her how the men who lived on board of her did not see a face from land for weeks together sometimes, when winds were stormy and waves rough. Candace listened eagerly. The rest of the party had gone back to their old places, but there was not so much chatter now. The dreamy influences of the hour were felt by every one. Dick Foster was quoting Tennyson in a low voice to pretty Julia Prime. Berry Joy and Georgie still kept up a fitful conversation with their cavalier; but Gertrude had grown silent, and Tom Joy was whistling softly to himself, with his eyes fixed on the sunset.  The \"Cornelia\" sped silently seaward. Suddenly they were in the shadow of a deep cove at the very end of Conanicut; and close by them rose out of the sea an immense square table of rock, over which, still as it was, the surge was constantly flinging showers of white spray. The whole top of this rock was black with large sea-birds. Candace had never imagined such a sight. The birds seemed crowding each other on every inch of space. Each moment some of them would rise, wheel in air with wild cries and screams, and then settle again to dispute for room, while the seething foam splashed over them; and the incessant flutter of their wings, the dashing spray, and the long wash of waves at the base of the rock gave to their place of refuge the effect of movement, so that it seemed to sway and float in the sea.  \"Oh, what a wonderful place!\" cried Candace. \"Such big birds, and so many of them,--what do you call them, Captain?\"  \"Wa'al, they're mostly cormorants and gulls, I reckon. That's what we call them down to Newport. They ain't no good for eating, so they don't get shot; and they do increase powerfully, though it seems to me I never did see quite so many on the Kettle Bottom before as this afternoon.\"  \"Is that the name of the rock?\"  \"Yes, the Kettle Bottom Rock; that's what it's called. It's a queer place. There was a painter here last summer, and he made a picter of it, with them birds all flying over it, which folks said was as like as like.\"  The line of hotels on Narragansett Beach was now plainly in sight. They were almost off Beaver Tail, and the sea was rougher.  \"Captain, we may as well put about,\" said Tom Joy. \"The sun's going down, and there's rather more motion hereabouts than the ladies like.\"  So they put about and sped harborward, helped by the tide which was now running swiftly in. Frank Rivington began to sing in a mellow tenor voice little barcarolles and Venetian boat-songs, which were full of a measured rhythmic movement like oar-strokes and the beat of waves. The pink in the west deepened after the sun went down to a vivid orange red, and flamed higher and higher till the zenith caught the glow; and a little crescent moon, which was climbing up, swung like a tiny silver boat on a crimson tide. It was all like a dream, to which the noiseless speed of the boat offered no interruption.  \"Good-night, Captain,\" said Candace, gently, as the \"Cornelia\" touched the wharf, at the upper end of which the carriages were waiting for them. \"I'm so much obliged to you for telling me all about the things.\"  \"You're welcome, I'm sure,\" replied the hearty Captain. \"It's been nothing but a pleasure so far as I'm concerned. Hope I may take you out sailing again, Miss.\"  \"Oh, I hope so. I think sailing is lovely.\"  \"Good-by, Miss Arden. I hope you have enjoyed it,\" said Mrs. Allen, as she was borne off by her husband. It was the sole remark addressed by the \"matron\" of the party to the little stranger under her care during that afternoon; but Candace had not felt neglected.  \"Oh, yes; very much, thank you,\" she replied. Tom Joy, who had waked up to the sense that \"the little girl in the red hat\" had not had much attention paid her on the sail, tried to get up a conversation as the beach-wagon climbed the hill; but Candace had but little small talk at her command, and they did not get on very fluently.  \"I've had a lovely time, Miss Joy,\" she said shyly, as they were set down at home.  \"I'm sure I'm glad. Good-night, Miss Arden.\" And that was all the notice which Berenice Joy took of her youngest guest, beyond the necessary good-afternoon when they first met on the wharf.  Candace was too unexacting, and too much accustomed to think of herself as a child to whom no particular attention was due, to realize or resent being treated with this scant courtesy. She told Cousin Kate about the sail and the seine steamer, and all the Captain's tales and explanations, with a glow of enjoyment which surprised Gertrude, and perhaps pricked her conscience somewhat; for that night, at hair-brushing time, she surprised Georgie by the observation, \"After all, Cannie is quite a sweet little thing.\"  \"So she is, sweet enough; but what makes you think of it just now?\"  \"Why, we rather left her out this afternoon, I am afraid. Hardly anybody said a word to her, except the Captain. It was rude enough of Berry, for it was her party; but I think it was worse for us. Any other girl would have been hurt and cross, and showed it; but Cannie never seemed to mind a bit, and enjoyed everything, and was just as nice and pleasant as if she had been the belle of the party.\"  \"Well, it _was_ too bad,\" said Georgie, penitently. \"I never thought about it, and I sat ever so far off from her, and Arnold Foster was so funny--in fact, I forgot Cannie. I took it for granted that she was being entertained, somehow.\"  \"I'm afraid both of us find it pretty easy to forget Cannie,\" remarked Gertrude. \"Well, I shall try to do better another time.\"     CHAPTER VI.  A TALK ABOUT SHYNESS.   \"CANNIE,\" said Mrs. Gray, a few days after the sailing-party, \"would you like to study French this summer, with Marian for company?\"  \"Y-es,\" replied Cannie; but she said it more because she saw that a yes was expected of her, than because of any real pleasure at the idea. Like most girls who have had scanty or poor teaching, she liked to read a great deal better than she liked to study.  \"Do you know any French at all?\" continued her cousin.  \"No, not any. There wasn't anybody at home who taught it; and if there had been, I don't believe Aunt Myra would have let me learn. She thinks English is a good enough language for anybody. I did study Latin a little while, though. Aunt Myra consented to that, because we had papa's Latin books in the house, and she said they might as well be useful.\"  \"Well, your Latin won't come amiss to your French,\" said Mrs. Gray, laughing to herself over this thrifty reason for learning a language. \"Marian is, of course, far ahead of you in speaking, for she learned it by ear, as they say of music, during the year we spent in France on our way home; but she knows but little of the rules and grammar. I think you will do very well together; for her fluency will tempt you on to talk, and your perseverance will keep her up to the exercises and conjugations, which are sad drudgery, but very needful if you are ever really to know anything of the language. You are persevering, are you not, Cannie?\"  \"I don't know whether I am or not,\" replied Candace, inly resolving to justify Cousin Kate's good opinion.  \"I have confidence in you,\" said Mrs. Gray, smiling kindly at her. \"And another thing I wanted to say is, that I think both you and Marian will enjoy the summer a great deal better for having one regular study to prepare for. It gives a sort of backbone to your lives, don't you see? Clear fun is like clear honey,--it cloys and loses its charm; but when it is mixed with occupation it keeps its flavor, and you don't get tired of it.\"  \"I can understand that,\" said Candace, thoughtfully. \"I recollect how nice Saturday afternoons used to seem when Aunt Myra had kept me busy darning stockings all the morning. I think I _would_ like the French lessons, Cousin Kate; only I am afraid the teacher will think me very stupid.\"  Candace's fears were not realized. As a beginner, her first steps were necessarily slow; but she took pains, and had no bad habits or evil accents to unlearn, and after a while she \"got hold\" of the language and went on more rapidly. Marian's fluent chatter stimulated her to try to talk as fast also, though Mademoiselle Bougereau, their teacher, found a great deal of fault with Marian, and said that many of the phrases which came so glibly out of her mouth partook of the nature of slang, and were not finished or elegant French. Still, with all drawbacks, the little class of two made fair progress; and Candace realized that what Mrs. Gray had said was true, and that all the bits of amusement and pleasure which came in her way were doubly enjoyed by reason of the little \"backbone\" of real work thus put into her days.  Another pleasure which she and Marian shared in common was a surf-bath before breakfast. Berry Joy had got up an omnibus party of girls, which she called \"The Early Dip Club,\" in which all four of Mrs. Gray's young people were included. Punctually at a quarter before seven on every fair morning the omnibus rattled up the Avenue; and the \"Club\" set out, under the care of an old experienced maid of Mrs. Joy's, who had nursed Berry, and could be trusted to see that none of the young ladies did anything very imprudent,--such as staying too long in the water or standing about in their wet bathing-dresses. At that early hour there were no loungers to stare at the party. The beach, cleanly swept by the tide of the night before, had scarcely a footprint to mar its smooth, firm sands. There was something delightful in the perfect freshness of the hour and place. Some of the girls had taken lessons in the \"School of Natation\" in the lower bay, and could swim very well. Candace could not swim, and made no attempt to learn; but she soon acquired the art of floating, under the tuition of Alice Frewen, who, next to Marian and herself, was the youngest of the party, and to whom she had taken a great fancy. The three \"children,\" as Berenice Joy called them, made common cause, and generally kept together, a little apart from the others, holding each other's hands and splashing up and down in the rollers with great enjoyment.  Bathing over, the \"Early Dippers\" returned home in their omnibus about the time that other people were waking up, bringing with them such cheeks and such appetites as were a satisfaction to their families, and did great credit to the powers of the Newport surf.  So the days sped on. It was full summer-tide now; yet the weather never seemed hot, except perhaps for an hour or two at a time. Morning after morning the sun would rise in a blaze of yellow, which anywhere else would have betokened a scorching day; and just as people had begun to say, \"What a sultry morning!\" lo, in one moment the wind would set in from the sea, strong, salty, fresh, invigorating; and, behold, it was cool! Or if the afternoon seemed for a little while oppressive in the streets of the old town, it was only necessary to go down to the end of the Avenue to find a temperature cool enough to be called chilly. Nobody ever thought of driving without a shawl, and the shawl was almost always needed. Mrs. Gray was wont to say that Newport had three different climates,--a warm one and a cold one and an in-between one,--and it had them all three every day, and people could take their choice, which was much more convenient than having only one.  The large places on the Cliffs were all open and occupied now. The flower-beds, newly planted when Candace came, made wonderful spaces of color everywhere in the emerald turf. Geraniums seemed as universal as grass, and their splendid reds and pinks were such as are seldom seen anywhere except in Newport. Foliage plants grew into enormous crimson or golden mats, which showed not one break in their luxuriant fulness. In the more ornate places were beds planted to look like Turkish carpets or Indian shawls, the pattern reproduced by hundreds of small plants of carefully adjusted hues, kept closely shaven so as to lie as flat as the objects they simulated. Roses were everywhere; and the soft drifting mists which now and again blew in from the sea, and the constant underlying moisture of the climate kept everything in a state of perfect freshness.  The Casino balls and lawn-tennis matches had begun. Visitors were pouring into the Ocean House; and every day increased the number of carriages, drags, dog-carts, pony phaetons, and village carts, which on all bright afternoons thronged the Avenue from end to end. Dinners and lawn-parties were of frequent occurrence, and during calling-hours the bell seemed always in vibration at the Gray cottage.--\"Cottage\" I call it; for in Newport everything that is not a \"villa\" is styled a \"cottage,\" no matter how big or square or uncompromising its appearance may be.  Candace was rather too young to be taken into general society, and she saw much less of these entertainments than Georgie; less even than Gertrude, who, by reason of her intimacy with Georgie's set, was often included in their parties, though not yet formally \"out.\" Mrs. Gray, however, thought it good for Candace to share a little of what was going on; and she took pains to have her invited now and then with the others to lawn-parties, excursions, or afternoon teas. If Mrs. Gray herself was present on these occasions, Cannie did pretty well; for she invariably got behind her cousin or beside her, made no attempt to talk, and just amused herself by watching what went on. But when Mrs. Gray did not go, and she was left to the tender mercies of Georgie and Gertrude, she was apt to feel lonely and unfriended; for with all the better resolutions of these pleasure-loving young people, they still found it \"easy to forget Cannie.\"  \"What are you going to do this morning, children?\" asked Mrs. Gray, one day at breakfast. \"Is the great tennis-match that we have heard so much about to come off, or have I forgotten the date?\"  \"No, this is the eventful day,\" replied Gertrude; \"and I am so nervous about it that I don't feel as if I could play at all.\"  \"Nonsense! you played beautifully yesterday,\" said Georgie.  \"There wasn't anything depending on me yesterday. It is queer how people never do their best when it is important that they should. I feel as if I were going to be all thumbs this morning.\"  \"Oh, you won't. You'll get excited and forget about the thumbs,\" remarked Georgie, consolingly. \"Mamma, aren't you coming to see us?\"  \"Yes, I think I shall; and I will bring Cannie with me. She hasn't seen the Casino yet.\"  Candace had become familiar with the street side of the pretty Casino building, and admired greatly its long faade, with the quaintly shingled curves and balconies, and the low gables, ornamented with disks and half suns in dull gilding,--all looking, Mrs. Gray said, as old as if it had stood there for a couple of centuries, instead of for three or four years only. But the street side, picturesque as it is, had by no means prepared her for what she saw as she followed her cousin through the entrance hall and into the quadrangle beyond.  What did she see? An open space of greenest turf, broken only by two long curving beds of foliage plants and a stone basin from which a fountain threw up a cool jet to refresh the air. On either hand, and on the side from which they had entered, was a line of low buildings, with balconies and _grilles_ of quaintly designed wood-work, windows filled with oddly tinted glass, and at one point a clock tower of rough masonry, over which vines were clustering. Connecting the buildings to right and left, was a raised covered gallery, semi-circular in shape, with a second gallery overhead; and on these ladies in fresh morning toilettes were sitting, some with pieces of embroidery in their hands, others collected in knots for conversation or to listen to the music of the band.  Beyond this gallery lay another and much larger quadrangle, with lines of trees and shrubs to veil its boundaries, on which lawn-tennis was being played in five or six courts at once. At the back of this quadrangle was another long low building, in the same picturesque style as the rest, which, Mrs. Gray explained, contained on one side a charming little theatre which could also be used as a ball-room, and on the other an admirable bowling-alley and racket-court for the use of the members. The band was playing gay music; a hum of conversation filled the air; pretty girls in white or blue or rose color were moving about; the wind drew with delicious coolness through the galleries; altogether it would have been hard to find on a summer morning a prettier place or a livelier scene.  Mrs. Gray was too much of a favorite not to be at once sought out. She was soon the centre of a little group of friends; and Candace sat beside her, silent as usual, but gazing with enchanted eyes at the animated figures on the tennis ground, at the gables and loggias of the restaurant building, at the curious clock-tower, with the heavy iron rings depending above the base, and its top like a bellflower. It was all like a fairy tale to her. Her imagination was actively at work, but no one would have guessed it from her quiet little face; and when Mrs. Gray introduced her to one person and another, she shrank into herself, and after her shy little bow and \"How do you do?\" relapsed again into stillness, and made no attempt to keep up a conversation. People were kind; but it is always easy to secure solitude in a crowd, and Cannie soon found herself let alone to her heart's content.  Gertrude was playing her best. Her nervousness had disappeared in the excitement of the game, as Georgie had predicted that it would, and some of her strokes were so clever as to win a little volley of applause from the by-standers. Candace did not know the game well enough to appreciate fine points of play, but she could perfectly appreciate the fun of winning; and when Gertrude, flushed and radiant, came to show her mother the prize she had won, a lace pin of gold filigree in the form of a racket, Cannie's face lighted up with a bright sympathy which was pleasant to see. A lady who had been watching her whispered to Mrs. Gray, \"What a sweet face that little niece of yours has!\"  \"So she has,\" replied Mrs. Gray; \"only she is so very timid. She never does herself justice.\"  \"Is it timidity? I had a fancy that she had an unhappy temper, or was troubled about something. Her face has always seemed so sad and overcast till just now, when it lit up at Gertrude's good fortune, and then I caught the true expression.\"  Mrs. Gray recollected this remark as she drove home with Candace, who, perfectly at ease now that she was alone with her cousin Kate, chattered and laughed like any other girl, and showed herself the happy young thing that she was. At home, even when with Georgie and Gertrude, she was no longer shy; but the moment a stranger came in, all was changed. It was like an evil spell cast by some enchanter. The pleasant smile and simple childish manner vanished, and Cannie became stiff, cold, awkward even; for her discomfort made her feel constrained in every limb and muscle. Her manner grew frigid, because she was frightened and wanted to hide it. If she had to shake hands, she did it without smiling and with downcast eyes; she was too ill at ease to be cordial. People thought that she was out of humor or troubled about something, and set her down as dull and unattractive; and with a natural reaction, Cannie felt that they did not like her, and that made her more uncomfortable than ever.  Mrs. Gray pitied Cannie very much, and had tried various methods to shake her out of her shyness and teach her confidence in herself. None of them so far had done any good. She now began to wonder if her analysis of the case was not wrong; if shyness was not a fault rather than a misfortune, and needed to be disciplined accordingly. She watched Candace for a day or two, and then she made up her mind. \"It will be kill or cure,\" she thought, as she ordered the coup and proposed to Cannie to take the ocean drive. Marian wanted to go too, and protested that there was plenty of room on the little let-down seat, and that she wouldn't crowd them a bit; but her mother was quite firm, and despatched her on an errand in the other direction without any compunctions.  \"I must have Cannie all to myself,\" she thought.  It was not till they were out of the Avenue and rolling along the smooth road beyond Bailey's Beach, with the fresh-water ponds on one hand and on the other the points and indentations of the coast, that Mrs. Gray led to the subject which was on her mind. The sea was intensely blue that afternoon, with shoots of creamy foam over every rock and ledge, and for a while they talked of nothing but the beauty of the day and the view. Finally Mrs. Gray began,--  \"How did you like Mrs. Endicott?\"  Mrs. Endicott was one of various visitors who had called that morning. Candace had been sent for, and had been more than usually awkward and unresponsive.  \"I liked her pretty well,\" said Candace. \"She didn't talk to me but a little while.\"  \"I know she didn't. It was on her account specially that I sent for you to come down,\" continued Mrs. Gray. \"Did she tell you that she was at school with your mother when they were quite little girls?\"  \"No!\" said Candace, surprised.  \"Yes; they were great friends, and she wrote to me before she came up that she was looking forward to seeing you. Shall I tell you why she so soon stopped talking to you? She told me afterward. She said: 'I wanted to talk to your niece about her mother, and to ask her to come to me for a visit; but she looked so frightened and seemed so stiff and shy and hard to get at, that I thought the kindest thing I could do would be to let her alone for the moment, till she was a little more used to me, and to talk to some one else. Next time I come, we shall get on better, I hope.'\"  Candace looked much mortified.  \"Was I stiff?\" she asked. \"I didn't know it. I didn't mean to be.\"  \"You are almost always stiff with strangers,\" said her cousin. \"I know you do not mean it, and you are not conscious of the effect of your own manner; but all the same it is stiff. Now, Cannie, will you promise me not to be hurt at what I am going to say?\"  \"Why, of course I won't,\" said Cannie, looking at her with trustful eyes.  \"Well then, listen! If I didn't know you,--if you were not my own dear little Cannie, whose warm heart I am sure of, and whose good intentions I know all about,--if I met you for the first time and judged of you merely from your manner, as all strangers must judge,--do you know what I should think?\"  \"What?\"  \"I should think you rather a cold-hearted girl, who didn't like people and didn't mind letting them know it.\"  \"Oh, Cousin Kate!\"  \"Or else, if I were more charitably inclined, I should think you a dull girl who did not take much interest in what went on about her.\"  \"Oh, Cousin Kate!\"  \"Or,\" continued her cousin, relentlessly, \"if I were a real angel, and disposed to make the very best of everybody, I should say to myself, 'The poor thing is so shy that she can't show what she really is.' Unluckily, there are few perfect angels in this world, and a great many of the other sort. And even as a perfect angel, my dear Cannie, I don't think I should consider you exactly agreeable.\"  \"But what can I do?\" demanded Candace, looking very unhappy. \"I can't make myself not shy.\"  \"No; but you can mend matters by forcing yourself to hide your shyness. I have been meditating on the subject, Cannie, and I have made up my mind that shyness is one form of selfishness.\"  \"Cousin Kate, how can you say that? I thought selfishness was doing what you liked and what is pleasant. I'm sure I don't _like_ to be shy.\"  \"Oh, it's not that kind of selfishness,\" said Mrs. Gray, smiling. \"There is nothing pleasant about shyness; that I am quite ready to admit. But can't you see that it is self-occupation, the being absorbed with your own sensations and feelings, and with trying to imagine what people are thinking about you, that makes you so miserable? If you could forget and occupy yourself with others, this shyness would go. Now, this morning, had you been full of Mrs. Endicott, and what she was like, and what she wanted to talk about, instead of little Candace Arden, and what Mrs. Endicott considered her like, it would all have been different, and much pleasanter for both of you.\"  \"Oh, if I only could,\" said Candace, with a catch in her voice, \"I would give anything I have in the world! I hate to seem so awkward and dull. But you've no idea how uncomfortable I feel, Cousin Kate. The moment I come downstairs and see that roomful of company, my face twitches and my cheeks burn, and I can't think of anything to say, and I keep wishing I could run upstairs again and hide somewhere.\"  \"Yes, because, as I said, your mind is full of yourself. If instead of coming in with this miserable self-consciousness full upon you, you could look upon the roomful as just so many people to whom you owe the little duties of politeness and cordiality, for whom you have the chance to do something kind or pleasant, you would forget your face and your cheeks and the desire to run away. You would be thinking of them, and in thinking of them you would forget to be shy.\"  Candace did not reply.  \"You are a conscientious child,\" her cousin went on. \"I think that you sincerely wish to do what is right, and to make God's rule the rule of your life. And, Candace, in my opinion you should consider it a part of religious duty to try to get rid of this false shame, this bondage to the idea of self, and to learn to live for others instead.\"  Candace looked up, with the dawn of a new idea in her face.  \"How do you mean?\" she asked.  \"You cannot always run away,\" continued her cousin. \"Big as it is, the world is not big enough to furnish hiding-places for all the people who are afraid to face their fellow-men. And since you cannot run away, your plain duty is to be brave and make the best of it. Now, Cannie, there are two things which may help you to do this, two thoughts which you can keep in mind; and I wish you would try to remember them when you feel a fit of fright or of stiffness coming on.\"  \"What are they?\"  \"One is, that you are but one little insignificant atom among thousands. People are not thinking about you or noticing you very particularly. You are not of much consequence except to yourself and the few friends who love you. This would be a mortifying fact, if vanity were your trouble; but as it is not, it is a comfortable one. And just as nobody notices you specially, so all the world is not engaged afterward in recollecting all your little mistakes and the stupid things you have said. Unless you have done something _very_ queer, they forget about you as soon as they lose sight of you. I know what miseries sensitive girls undergo in thinking over their foolish speeches and actions, and imagining that every one remembers them as distinctly as they themselves do.\"  Cannie couldn't help smiling. \"Cousin Kate, how can you know about all those things?\" she asked.  \"Because I was a girl myself once, and as foolish as any of the rest of you; and I have not forgotten how it feels to be a girl,\" said her cousin, gayly. \"That is the use of growing old, Cannie. You can show the way to younger people, and make the road you have walked over a little easier for them.--But to go back to what we were talking about, our own insignificance is one helpful thought, as I said; the other is, that kindliness is one of the Christian virtues, and it is just as much a duty to practise it as it is to be honest and temperate.\"  Candace drew a long breath.  \"It would be perfectly delightful to keep thinking like that always,\" she said; \"the only thing is that I am afraid I should forget when the time came. I wish you could give me an exact rule, Cousin Kate, just what to say and how to act. I would try ever so hard to follow it.\"  \"I know you would,\" said Mrs. Gray; \"but there is no exact rule that I can give, except the Golden one, to do to others just as you would like them to do to you. If you feel stiff, be sure to look cordial. Smile, and shake hands as if you meant it. Try to look interested in what people are saying to you. A good listener helps on conversation as well as a good talker. If you are friendly and warm in your manner, other people will warm to you instinctively. Try it, Cannie, and see if I am not right. And now we will not talk any more about ourselves or our shyness, but drive into the Fort and listen to the music. I caught a strain from the Band just then, and I recollect that this is a 'Fort Day.'\"  So in they drove, clattered between walls and embankments, and over a steep paved incline beneath a great arch, and found themselves in an open square, with buildings of solid masonry on all sides, in the midst of which the band was stationed. Other carriages were drawn up to listen to the music, and officers in uniform were coming and going, and talking to the ladies in the carriages. One of these officers, a nice old Major, with a bald spot under his gold-banded cap, knew Mrs. Gray, and came to welcome her. His \"girls\" were gone over to Newport to a lawn-party, he said; but he insisted on taking Mrs. Gray and Cannie in to see their quarters, which were in a casemate, in close neighborhood to one of the great guns. Here he brewed them a delicious cup of tea; and afterward, at Mrs. Gray's request, he took Candace to see the magazines, and some of the curious underground passages which connect one side of the Fort with the other. Cannie thought these extremely interesting, and like all the caves on desert islands which she had ever read about; for they were narrow, dark, and mysterious, they smelt very close, and all sorts of odd funguses and formations were growing on the roofs overhead.  These adventures chased the worry from her mind and the anxious puckers from her forehead; and she went home quite happily, without recurring again to the subject of their late conversation. But she did not forget it, and it bore fruit. Mrs. Gray noted, without seeming to be on the watch, the efforts which Candace thenceforward made to overcome her shyness. She saw her force herself to come forward, force herself to smile, to speak, when all the time she was quaking inwardly; and she felt that there was real power of character required for such an effort. Quiet Candace would always be; modest and retiring it was her nature to be: but gradually she learned not to seem cold and stiff; and when her cousin saw her, as she sometimes did, forgetting herself in talking to some one, and lighting up into her easy, natural, bright manner, she felt that the rather hard lesson administered that afternoon on the ocean drive had not been in vain. Rome was not built in a day, and ease of manner is not acquired in a moment; but Candace had at last got hold of a right idea, and there was hope that with time people less charitable even than \"perfect angels\" might pronounce her \"agreeable.\"     CHAPTER VII.  TWO PICNICS.   IT was while Candace was still doing battle with her shyness, sometimes getting the better of it and then again yielding and letting it get the better of her, that Georgie and Gertrude sent out invitations to another luncheon party of girls. It was the third they had given since coming to Newport. Mrs. Gray certainly did a great deal for the pleasure of her daughters, although Berenice Joy did consider her so \"strict.\"  Candace had her share in this entertainment, as one of the three young ladies of the house. The party was mainly composed of the \"Early Dippers,\" who were not as formidable to her imagination as entire strangers would have been. She and Georgie and Gertrude wore their white woollen dresses, which were almost exactly alike, and \"looked like triplets,\" as Marian rather spitefully observed. Marian herself was not asked to the party, and was out of humor in consequence. Her crossness did not extend to Candace, however. She evinced this by coming in just as Candace had finished dressing, with a long-stemmed pink rose in her hand, which she pinned on the shoulder of the white gown, just under Candace's cheek.  \"That looks sweet,\" remarked Marian. \"I am really quite pleased at your appearance; you're every bit as pretty as Gertrude, and heaps better looking than that old Georgie, who wouldn't let me come to her party. Now, take my advice: hold your head up, and don't let any of the girls bully you. If Berry Joy tries it, sit down hard on her.\"  \"I don't know how to sit down hard,\" laughed Candace; but she kissed Marian for the sweet rose, and went downstairs feeling quite brave. Marian watched her over the balusters; made a face at Berry Joy, who was just sailing into the drawing-room; shook her dimpled fist at Georgie's back, visible through the open door; and then went to sit with her mother, who also was \"not invited.\"  There is no prettier entertainment than a lunch-party of girls. The flowers, the confections, all the graceful little fripperies of the feast, seem to suit with the bright young faces, to whom daylight is a becoming and not a dangerous test. Frederic had taken great pains in ornamenting the table for his young ladies. There was a nosegay for each guest, and no two nosegays were alike. One was made up of roses and daisies, another of roses and heliotrope, another of roses and violets; and each was tied with a satin ribbon of corresponding color, which had the name of the girl for whom it was intended, and the date, painted in gold letters on the ends. In the middle of the table stood a large square pan of glass, in which floated a mass of waterlilies, pink and white; and winding in and out among the little dishes of crystallized fruits, clairs, apricots, and hot-house grapes, was a continuous curving wreath of pansies of every color. It appeared to lie directly on the white tablecloth; but the stems of the flowers were really set in shallow semi-circles of tin, not over half an inch high, which were filled with wet sand.  For the more substantial part of the meal appeared a succession of appetizing little dishes, hot and perfectly served; and the wind-up of the whole was, of course, unlimited ice-cream and water-ices, those national delicacies dear equally to the heart of every American girl the country over, whether she consumes her saucer-full in uppermost Maine or southernmost Florida.  Luncheon over, the party went out to the piazza, where coffee was served; and then Berry Joy began to tell of a picnic at Southwick's grove which she had attended the day before. None of the other girls had, as it happened, been present; so she had the field of narrative to herself.  \"It was perfectly splendid,\" she said. \"There were five coaches with four ladies and a lot of men in each, and ever so many other carriages. We made a sort of procession down the Island. I went in Lawrence Jones's coach, with Sue Tucker and Maude and Mrs. Freddy. You should have seen the country people rush out to look at us when all the horns blew at once. I tell you it was exciting.\"  \"And what did you do after you got to the grove?\"  \"Oh, we had the most wonderful spread that ever was seen. You know, everybody takes a dish and a bottle of wine to these picnics; and there is always a great competition as to who shall bring the best things. I never saw such a luncheon in my life; everything was perfectly delicious.\"  \"But what did you _do_?\"  \"Do? Why, we didn't do anything but that. There was no time for anything else. It took ever so long to get lunch ready. Some of the things had to be cooked after we got there, you know, and the coffee and the mayonnaise made. The servants lit fires and fussed about, and the rest of us sat round and talked a little; but I was so ravenous that I couldn't think of anything but lunch, and I rather think the others were in the same condition. Then, as soon as we had done, it was time to start for home.\"  \"What do you think that horrid Mr. Deane said?\" she continued, after a short pause. \"You know, he's always trying to be satirical. Some one was saying something about the grove's being such a nice place for picnics, and Mr. Deane interrupted, in that disagreeable dry way of his which some people call funny: 'Well, yes, perhaps so; but in my opinion the proper place for a picnic of this kind is--a gorge!'\"  There was a universal giggle.  \"How did he dare?\" observed Julia Prime.  \"Oh, he dares to say just what he likes. He doesn't mind anybody. But I know one thing, and that is that Gorham Allerton didn't like it a bit. He looked absolutely black, and I saw him talking to Mrs. Jackson Tainter about it afterward; and I'll wager something handsome that old Deane will find himself left out of the next picnic. I'm sure, if he does, it will only serve him right for being so rude.\"  \"I don't believe he'll mind it if he isn't invited,\" remarked Gertrude. \"He dined with papa last night; and I heard him say that it was the dullest affair he ever was at in his life, and only fit for the 'companions of Ulysses.'\"  \"What _did_ he mean?\"  \"I don't know. Something about General Grant, I suppose.--Candace, what _are_ you laughing at?\"  \"Oh, nothing,\" said Cannie, composing her face as well as she could. A little old translation of the Odyssey had been among the books in the North Tolland library, and she was more \"up\" in the \"companions of Ulysses\" than the rest of the party.  \"How different picnics now-a-days are from those which we used to have in Newport when I was a girl,\" remarked Mrs. Gray from the drawing-room window, where she had been standing unperceived for a moment or two.  \"Oh, Mrs. Gray, are you there?\" and the girls hastened to the window. Some of them kissed her; and all, except perhaps Berry Joy, looked glad to see her, for she was a general favorite with her daughters' friends.  \"Tell us about the picnics you used to have when you were young,\" said Julia Prime, balancing herself on the window-sill and keeping fast hold of Mrs. Gray's hand.  \"There is not much to tell, Julia. They would seem tame affairs enough to you modern young people, I suppose. We hadn't any men with us as a general thing, except an occasional brother or cousin, and we didn't carry half as much to eat as seems to be considered necessary now-a-days. Then we did all the work ourselves instead of taking cooks and footmen to do it for us; but for all that, we thought them most delightful. For one thing, we always went to some really interesting place, such as the Glen, or the Dumpling Rocks, or the Paradise Valleys.\"  \"Where are the Paradise Valleys?\" inquired Julia.  \"Oh, I know what they are,\" said Maud Hallett. \"They are lovely places hidden in behind Bishop Berkeley's Rock. I went there once with Aunt Edith. She knows all the nooks and corners of Newport better than anybody else.\"  \"Mamma, you must take us there some day,\" said Georgie.  \"Oh, do, and let me go with you,\" pleaded Maud. \"I should like so much to see them again.\"  \"Won't you take me too?\" said Belle Jeffrys.  \"We should all like to go,\" remarked Julia, slyly. \"Oh, Mrs. Gray, dear, I have such a lovely idea! Give us a picnic yourself, one of the nice old-fashioned sort that you used to have when you were young, in the Paradise Valley; won't you, dear Mrs. Gray? Oh, do!\"  \"You needn't coax so hard, Julia; I'm very easy to persuade when I like to do a thing,\" said Mrs. Gray, with a laugh. \"I'll give you a picnic with pleasure; only I must make one stipulation, that it shall be exclusively a girl-party. I don't think the young men of the present day would enjoy the kind of thing I mean, or know what to make of it.\"  \"Girls!\" cried Julia, \"just listen to what this dear angel says! She's going to take us to Paradise Valley, all by ourselves, with no men to bother and distract our attention.--Men _are_ out of place in Paradise anyway; just think how Adam behaved! (this in a parenthesis).--It is to be a real old-fashioned \"goloptious\" picnic. Now, who would like to go besides myself?\"  \"I, I, I,\" cried the girls, with gratifying unanimity.  \"Now, what day shall it be?\" continued Julia. \"Let's make Mrs. Gray settle the time at once, and then she can't back out.\"  \"I don't want to back out,\" said Mrs. Gray. \"I enjoy the idea as much as you do.\"  So, after some comparing of engagements, the next Thursday was fixed upon.  \"You had better make this the rendezvous,\" said the giver of the picnic. \"I shall have room for one girl in my wagonette besides my four. You must all wear something stout, which won't spoil with scrambling over rocks, and you need not bring any luncheon-baskets. I will see to all that. This is to be an old-fashioned picnic, you know, and I shall provide exactly the sort of things that we used to take            'When I was young and charming, many years ago.'\"  \"You are just as charming as you can be now,\" declared Belle, enthusiastically.  \"I do hope there won't be a fog,\" said Julia Prime, as she walked up the Avenue with the others.  \"I sha'n't care if there is,\" replied Berry. \"I must say it sounds to me like a very stupid plan,--no men, and nothing in particular to eat. It's just like Mrs. Gray. Her ideas are so queer, as mamma says.\"  \"I wonder you go if you feel that way about it,\" retorted Julia.  \"I dare say I sha'n't. I have a strong presentiment that on that particular day I shall have a headache.\"  And Berry did,--a \"distracting\" headache, as she wrote Georgie over-night. She was the only member of the Early Dip Club who missed the picnic. Headaches are sad but convenient things.  Eleven o'clock brought the girls to the Grays' front door, all ready for their start, in various village carts and victorias. There was a little re-distribution: Georgie and Gertrude fitted in with some of their cronies, and Mrs. Gray took three girls besides Marian and Candace in her wagonette. Frederic and the coachman stowed many small baskets and a heap of wraps into the different rumbles and box seats, and they set forth under the bluest of blue skies. It was a beautiful day, just warm enough and not too warm; for a fragrant wind was blowing softly in from the sea.  They had passed the first beach, which at that hour was black with bathers and by-standers, and had climbed the hill-slope which separates it from the second beach, when Marian suddenly cried, \"Mamma, here we are close to Purgatory; can't we stop just a minute and show it to Candace?\"  Mrs. Gray looked at her watch.  \"Your minute will be at least a quarter of an hour, Marian,\" she said; \"but I think there is time enough. Would any of the rest of you like to go?\"  Girls always \"want to go.\" There was a general disembarkation; and Mrs. Gray led the way through a gate and across a rough field which stretched along the top of a line of cliffs, steeper and bolder than those on the Newport Point, and cut here and there into sudden sharp fissures.  The scanty grass, yellow with August sun, was broken everywhere by lumps and boulders of that odd conglomerate which is known by the name of \"plum-pudding stone.\" Golden-rod and the early blue aster were flowering everywhere. A flock of sheep fled at their approach, with a low rushing sound like the wind in boughs.  [Illustration: PURGATORY.  The name of \"Purgatory\" seemed to her to suggest some terrible sort of place.--PAGE 188.]  Candace walked along with the rest, in a little shiver of expectancy. The name of \"Purgatory\" seemed to her to suggest some terrible sort of place. Presently she saw the girls ahead, as they reached a particular point, diverge sharply to the right with little cries and exclamations; and when she advanced, she found herself on the edge of a chasm deeper and darker than any of those which they had passed. It cut the cliff from its highest point to the sea-level; and the wall-like sides receded toward their base, leaving vaulted hollows beneath, into which the eye could not penetrate. Only the ear caught the sound of thunderous murmurs and strange gurgles and hisses of spray echoing from unseen recesses far underground; and it was easy to imagine that these sounds came from some imprisoned sea-creature, hemmed in by the tide, with no chance of escape, and vexing the air with its groans.  Candace shrank away from the brink with a sensation of affright. \"What an awful place!\" she said, drawing a long breath. \"Do you suppose any one ever fell down there?\"  Every member of the party had some tradition of the sort to relate; but none of the stories seemed to rest on a very secure foundation.  \"Anybody who did must be killed, I should think. I don't wonder they named it Purgatory,\" said Marian.  There was a fascination of horror about the spot. The girls lingered and leaned over the brink and turned back, until Mrs. Gray had to call them away; and they were all rather silent as they walked across the field to their carriages. But the impression was soon dispelled; for as they drove down the incline toward the second beach, they came upon an unexpected scene of brilliant and animated life.  The tide and the wind together were bringing ashore quantities of seaweed of the kind used in manuring fields, and all the farmers of the neighborhood had assembled to secure this heaven-planted harvest. The long curves of yellow sands which stretch from the Purgatory rocks to Sacluest Point were alive with people. Teams of mild mouse-colored or white oxen stood harnessed to heavy wagons, ready to drag the seaweed home. Out in the plunging surf men were urging horses seaward, or swimming them toward the shore, with long rake-like implements in their wake, which gathered and bore along masses of the glittering brown and rosy kelp. The splash and foam of the waves, the rearing horses, the cries of the men and of the seagulls, who seemed to resent this intrusion upon their haunts, made a vivid and fascinating picture, which seemed in keeping with the beauty of sea and sky and the freshness of the sun-warmed wind.  Then, passing the beach, the carriages drove along a smooth country road for a short distance, and turned into a narrow lane running up hill, which presently brought them to a small farm-house built on the very edge of a ravine.  \"Here we take to our feet,\" said Mrs. Gray, jumping out of the wagonette.  The farmer and his wife, who seemed to be old acquaintances, came out to speak to her. The baskets were collected, and the carriages sent back to town, with orders to return to the same place at six o'clock.  \"Oh, why six? why not stay and go home by moonlight?\" urged Julia.  \"My dear child, if you were in the habit of reading either the almanac or the heavens, you would know that there will be no moon to-night till after eleven o'clock,\" said her chaperone. \"These roads will be as black as pitch by half-past seven. Now, girls, each of you take your own shawl and one of the baskets, and we will _descend_ into Paradise. It sounds paradoxical, but you shall see.\"  She led the way down a steep narrow pathway on the hill-side into the valley below. The path was overhung with trees. It was necessary to put the boughs aside here and there; brambles reached from the thicket to catch at the girls' skirts as they went by; but when they had passed these trifling obstacles they found themselves safely on the level floor of a little valley below.  Such a choice little valley! It was enclosed between the line of hill from which they had just descended and another parallel line, whose top was of solid granite and whose base was walled by trees. This double barrier kept off all cold winds, and let the sunshine in from east to west to flood and foster the valley growths. To the east the eye saw only the winding of the leafy glade; the west stood open to the sea, and gave a wide vista of glittering ocean and yellow surf-fringed beach.  The ground was carpeted with the softest grass. Thickets of wild roses showed here and there a late blossom, and other thickets of alders glittered with coral-red berries. Apple-trees loaded with small crimson apples made spots of color on the hill-side. Wild-flowers grew thickly in damp spots, and mosses clustered among the stones. Birds chirped and flew from every bush and tree. All was shaded and peaceful and still. Newport, with its whirl and glitter, seemed immeasurably far away. The Paradise Valley might to all appearance have been hidden in the heart of the Alleghanies, instead of being within three miles of the gayest watering-place in America!  Mrs. Gray, with accustomed feet, led the way straight across the glade to where an old cedar-tree stood commanding the oceanward view, with a square block of stone at its foot.  \"This is where we used always to come,\" she said, in a dreamy voice.  \"What a delicious place!\" cried Julia; \"to think that I should have spent seven summers in Newport and never have seen it before! What shall we do with the baskets, Mrs. Gray, dear?\"  \"Put them here in the shade, and when you all feel hungry we will open them.\"  \"Hungry! why, I am as hungry as a wolf at this moment. I have a gift at being ravenous. Girls, what do you say? Don't you agree with me that no time is like the present time for lunch? Hold up your hands if you do.\"  \"Very well,\" said Mrs. Gray, laughing, as every hand flew up. \"We will have lunch at once, then; but I warn you that there is a good deal to be done first. There,\" pointing to a blackened spot against a rock, \"is where we always boiled our kettle. If some of you will collect some dry sticks, we will see if the present generation is capable of making a fire. I meanwhile will fetch the water.\"  She took a bright little copper kettle from one of the baskets, and mounted the hill with elastic footsteps, calling out, as she went,--  \"Make haste, and be sure that the sticks are dry.\"  \"I'm not sure that I know a dry stick when I see it,\" whispered Maud Hallett to Julia; but instinct, as often happens, took the place of experience on this occasion, and Mrs. Gray found quite a respectable pile of fuel awaiting her when she came back with her kettle full of spring water.  \"Now I will show you how to swing a pot over the fire,\" she said; and in three minutes a rustic crane of boughs was constructed, the kettle was hanging from it, and the wood piled artistically underneath. A box of matches appeared from Mrs. Gray's pocket, which; as Marian said, was every bit as good as the \"Bag\" of the Mother in the \"Swiss Family Robinson,\" and seemed to hold almost as great a variety of useful things. Presently a gay little fire was crackling and snapping against the face of the rock, and adding its smoke to the blackened stains left by those other smokes of long ago. The girls stood about, watching the blaze and listening for the first hiss of the kettle; but Mrs. Gray informed them that there was still work to be done.  \"I want some new potatoes to roast, for one thing,\" she said. \"Maud and Georgie, you might run up to the farm and ask Mr. Bacon to send me a few, say eighteen or twenty large ones,--oh, and a couple of dozen fresh eggs.\"  While they were absent on this errand, the other girls, under Mrs. Gray's direction, unpacked the baskets and arranged their contents on the rock beneath the cedar-tree. Mrs. Gray had taken pains to provide, as far as was possible, the same sort of food which twenty-odd years before it had been customary to take to picnics. Out of one basket came a snow-white table-cloth and napkins; out of another, a chafing-dish, a loaf of home-made brown bread, and a couple of pats of delicious Darlington butter. A third basket revealed a large loaf of \"Election Cake,\" with a thick sugary frosting; a fourth was full of crisp little jumbles, made after an old family recipe and warranted to melt in the mouth. There was a pile of thin, beautifully cut sandwiches; plenty of light-buttered rolls; and a cold fowl, ready carved into portions. By the time that these provisions were unpacked, Maud and Georgie were seen descending the hill at a rapid walk, which, at sight of the festive preparations below, changed to what Julia Prime called \"a hungry gallop.\" By this time exercise and fresh air had made everybody so desperately hungry that it seemed impossible to wait another moment; so, while Mrs. Gray heated the coffee and dropped the large pink potatoes into their bed of embers to roast, the younger members of the party fell to work on the sandwiches, just to take off the fine edge of their appetites till something better was ready.  When the coffee was hot, Mrs. Gray seated herself by the rock, lit the lamp under her chafing-dish, dropped in a bit of butter, sprinkled with pepper and salt, and proceeded to \"scramble\" a great dish of eggs. Did any of you ever eat hot scrambled eggs under a tree when you were furiously hungry? If not, you can form no idea of the pleasure which the \"Early Dippers\" took in theirs. But it was not the eggs only; it was everything: never was a luncheon so delicious, the girls protested. New potatoes roasted in the ashes were a feast for the gods; and as for the grandmother's cake with which the repast wound up, it baffled analysis and description.  Mrs. Gray had made this cake with her own hands, \"in order to carry out the historic verities,\" as she said. It used to be part of the religion of New England, especially of Connecticut, she explained; and she told them how once, when she was a girl, making a visit to an old aunt in Wethersfield, she had sat up nearly all night over a \"raising\" of Election cake.  \"But why did you do that?\" asked the girls.  \"Well, you see, my aunt had a sudden attack of rheumatism in her arm. She was going to have the sewing-society meet at her house; and such a thing as a sewing-society without Election cake was not to be dreamed of. So I offered to make it; and I was bound that it should be good. The peculiarity of this particular cake is that it must rise twice before it is baked. You mix half the butter and sugar, and so on, with the yeast; and when that is light, you put in the other half. Now, my first half refused to rise.\"  \"What did you do?\"  \"Oh, I sat beside it with one of Scott's novels, and I waited. It was rather poky; for my aunt and her servant had gone to bed, and there were queer creaks and noises now and then, as there always are in old houses. Midnight struck, and one, and two, before the first bubbles appeared on the surface of the cake; and I had fallen asleep over my book more than once, before I could be quite sure that it was safe to stir in the remainder of the spice and fruit, and go to bed. It was just four o'clock when I finally put out my lamp; and very sleepy I was next day, as you may imagine: but the cake turned out a great success, and I had many compliments about it from the crack housekeepers in the neighborhood, when they found that it was of my making.\"  \"Wasn't it a dreadful trouble to have to make cake and things like that at home?\" asked Maud Hallett. \"I think I would rather have had it not quite so good, and got it from the confectioner's, than to have all that fuss and bother.\"  \"My dear, there _were_ no confectioners in those days except in two or three of the largest cities, and none even then who would be thought worth speaking of in our time. It was a case of home-made cake or none; and though it was certainly a great deal of trouble, the cake was better than any confectioner's cake that I ever tasted. People took great pride in it; and recipes were copied and handed about and talked over with an interest which would be impossible now-a-days, when everything comes to hand ready made, and you can order a loaf of sponge cake by postal card, and have it appear in a few hours, sent by express from central New York, as some of us have been doing this summer.\"  The last crumb of the Grandmother's loaf had now disappeared, and Mrs. Gray proposed that the girls should go for a scramble on the hills while she repacked the baskets. But this division of labor was not permitted. The girls insisted that they must be allowed to stay and help, and that the scramble would be no fun at all without their matron. Julia seized the coffee-pot and chafing-dish, and ran up the hill to rinse them at the spring; the others collected forks and plates; and, many hands making light work, in a very short while all was in order, and Mrs. Gray in readiness to head the walking party.  She guided them to the top of the granite ridge which is visible from Newport, and made them observe the peculiarity of the rock lines, and the contrast between their bareness and the fertility of the little intervening glades, for which they serve as a natural conservatory. Then they dipped down into the thickets of the farther side, finding all manner of ferns and wild-flowers and shy growing things, and so to the sandy flats above the third beach, with their outlook across the river-like strait to Little Compton and up the curving shore of Newport Island, set with old farm-houses and solemn orchards of gnarled apple-trees. From thence a short walk brought them to the end of the ridge and to Bishop Berkeley's seat, with its ponderous projecting roof of rocks; and they all sat down to rest just where he is said to have sat with his books and pen, looking off toward far Bermuda, and dreaming of the \"star of empire.\" At that time no ugly brick chimneys or artificial water-basin existed to mar the foreground; and nothing sweeter or more peaceful could be imagined than the view from the rocky shelf,--the breadth of ocean lit with clear sun, the shining capes to right and left, the yellow sand-dunes and winding creek bordered with brown grasses and patches of mallow or green rushes, and over all the arch of blue summer sky. One or two carriages rolled along the distant road as they sat there; but otherwise; the stillness was unbroken save by the twitter of birds in the woods behind them, the chirp of sand-peeps or the scream of gulls on the beach, and the soft intermittent boom of the surf.  It had been a perfect afternoon, and a great success, all the picnickers voted, as they parted in the dusk on the gravel-walk in front of Mrs. Gray's door. Yet, after all, there was much to be said for Newport and civilization, and they were not sorry to come back to them. It was all very well to play at being old-fashioned for a day; but modern times have their distinct charms and conveniences, and if the girls, on sober second-thought, preferred their own share of the centuries to any other, no one need count them blameworthy.     CHAPTER VIII.  BRIC-A-BRAC.   ONE afternoon in August, Candace happened to be alone in the drawing-room with Mrs. Gray when Mrs. Joy was announced.  \"My dear,\" began that lady, after administering the two hard, rapid little kisses which were her idea of a cordial greeting, \"I've come to see if you don't want to go down to the Point with me. There's an old woman there, I hear, who has a lot of wonderful old china and some mahogany arm-chairs which she wants to sell, and I'm going to look at them. Do put your things on, and come. I hate to drive alone; and there's no fun in this sort of expedition unless there's some one along with you.\"  \"You are very kind,\" said Mrs. Gray; \"but I have promised Mr. Gray to go with him at four to call on some friends who have just arrived at Bateman's, so it's quite impossible for me to go with you. Who is the old woman? Do you recollect her name?\"  \"Oh, Collishan or Collisham,--some name like that. She lives in Third Street.\"  \"It must be old Miss Colishaw. Are you sure she wants to sell her china?\" asked Mrs. Gray, who as a child had spent many summers in Newport before it became a fashionable watering-place, and knew the townspeople much better than did Mrs. Joy.  \"I believe so; why shouldn't she? She's as poor as a church mouse, they tell me; and what use can such things be to her? She would rather have the money, of course. You can't go, then? I'm awfully sorry. But you'll let me have one of the girls, dear, won't you? I absolutely can't do it alone.\"  \"Georgie has gone to drive with Berry, and I am sorry to say that Gertrude is on the sofa with a headache.\"  \"Well, here's Miss Candace; she hasn't a headache, I'm sure: perhaps she will take pity on me.--You'll come, won't you? that's a dear. Run and put on your hat. It's a splendid afternoon, and the Point's a very interesting place if you happen to like old things. I don't care for them myself; but they're all the fashion now, you know, and I dare say you've caught the fever with the rest of the folks.--She can come, can't she, dear Mrs. Gray?\"  \"I don't think she has any engagement,\" replied Mrs. Gray, trying not to smile at the struggle with dismay that was going on in Candace's countenance; \"she likes driving, and it is a beautiful afternoon.--You can go, can't you, Cannie?\"  It was impossible on the spur of the moment to frame any excuse. Mrs. Joy's eyes were full upon her; Cousin Kate gave no help; there seemed nothing to do but to comply. Candace murmured something about \"Certainly,--very kind,--very happy,\" and went away to put on the red hat, which went very well with the dress of red and white linen that she happened to have on. It was a new one, which Mrs. Gray had bought for warm days, and which Elizabeth had fitted and made. She wore a red rose in her breast, and had a pair of gray gloves, and she looked very fresh and girlish in this simple costume; but Mrs. Joy did not quite approve of it.  \"Why don't they fix the little thing up better?\" she was thinking to herself as she got into the carriage. \"It's too bad. She'd be quite nice-looking if she were a little more stylish. A light silk, now, or a surah in two shades, like Berry's blue, would make quite a different thing of her.\"  \"You've been down on the Point before now, I suppose,\" she said as they rolled smoothly along the Avenue.  \"Yes, once I did. Cousin Kate took me with her one day to call on a friend of hers, Miss Gisborne.\"  \"Oh, yes, that queer old maid. I know they're very intimate, though I confess I never could see what Mrs. Gray finds in her to like. She's so eccentric, and so different from other people, and she wears such extraordinary clothes.\"  \"But she's very nice, and she tells the funniest stories, and her house is ever so pretty,\" said Candace, rather at a loss to know what she ought to say.  \"Ah, indeed, is it? Inside, you mean. I don't think it amounts to much outside, though people who have a mania for old houses rave about it, I believe. I'm afraid I'm dreadfully modern in my tastes. I can't, for the life of me, see any beauty in ceilings so low that you bump your head against them, and little scraps of windows filled with greenish glass that you can't see through, and which make you look like a mouldy fright, if any one looks through from the outside.\"  \"Miss Gisborne's window-panes _are_ green,\" admitted Candace. \"Some of them are so old that they have colors all over them like mother-of-pearl,--red and blue and yellow. I liked to see them; and she told us that last summer an architect who was going by the house stopped and looked at them a long time, and then rang the bell and offered to give her new sashes with great big panes in them if she would exchange; but she wouldn't.\"  \"The more fool she!\" rejoined Mrs. Joy, frankly. \"My! what a splendid big house that is going to be! That's the kind of thing I like.\" And she pointed to an enormous half-finished structure of wood, painted pumpkin color and vermilion, which with its size, its cottage-like details, and the many high thin chimneys which rose above its towering roofs, looked a happy mixture of an asylum, a factory, and a Swiss chlet.  \"But what a little bit of ground there is about it for such a big house!\" said Candace, whose country eyes were often struck by the disproportion between the Newport edifices and the land on which they stood.  \"Yes; land is so dreadfully dear now that people can't afford large places.\"  \"I wonder why this is called 'Farewell Street,'\" said Candace, looking at the name painted on the corner of a street into which they were turning.  \"Some people say it's because this is the street by which funerals come away from the Cemetery,\" replied Mrs. Joy. \"There's the Reading-room down there. You've seen that, I suppose. Mrs. Gray comes down to the mothers' meetings sometimes, I know.\"  \"Yes; and she has promised to take me with her some day, but we haven't gone yet.\"  The carriage now turned into a narrow street, parallel with the Bay, but not in sight of it; and Mrs. Joy indicated to her footman a low dormer-windowed house, shabby with weather-stains and lack of paint, whose only ornament was a large and resplendent brass knocker on its front door.  \"That's the place,\" she said. \"Just look at that knocker. I know for a certainty that lots of people have offered to buy it, and the absurd old creature to whom it belongs won't sell. She declares that it's been there ever since she can remember, and that it shall stay there as long as she stays. So ridiculous, when things of the kind bring such an enormous price now, and she really needs the money!\"  The carriage now stopped. Mrs. Joy got out, and Candace with her. The footman seized the shining knocker, and gave a loud rap.  \"Go back to the carriage, Wilkins,\" said Mrs. Joy. Then she added in a low voice to Candace: \"Get close to the door, dear. These people are so queer. I often have to push my way in, but I can always manage them in the end.\"  The door was opened a very little way by a very little girl.  \"Is Miss Collisham at home?\" asked Mrs. Joy, at the same time inserting her foot deftly between the door and the door-frame, to insure that the door should not be closed against her.  \"No, 'm,\" said the child. \"She's gone out.\"  \"Dear me, what a shame! where is she?\" demanded the visitor, in an aggrieved tone, as if Miss Colishaw had no right to be out when wanted by the owner of such a fine equipage.  \"She's over to old Miss Barnes's. She's sick,\" replied the little girl.  \"Who's sick?--old Miss Barnes? And where does she live?\"  \"Just over there in First Street,\" said the child, staring at Candace, whose big red hat had caught her fancy. \"'Tain't but a little way,\" she added.  \"Ah, indeed!\" said Mrs. Joy, pushing her way into the entry. \"Well, then, you just run over to this place, dear, and tell Miss Collisham that there's a lady waiting to speak to her on business. Be quick, that's a good little girl! This young lady and I will sit down here and wait till you come back.\"  The small maiden looked uncertain and rather frightened; but Mrs. Joy marched resolutely into the little parlor on one side of the hall, and seated herself; so, after a pause of hesitation, the child seized a sun-bonnet which lay on a chair, and set off at a run in the direction indicated. The moment she was gone Mrs. Joy jumped briskly up.  \"Such a piece of good luck!\" she cried. \"One so rarely gets the chance to examine a place like this without the bother of a family standing by to watch everything you do.\" Then, to Candace's horror and astonishment, she walked straight across the room to a cupboard which her experienced eye had detected in the side of the chimney, opened the door, and took a survey of the contents.  \"Nothing there,\" she remarked, locking it up, \"only medicine bottles and trash. Let's try again.\" She opened a closet door, and emitted a sigh of satisfaction.  \"These must be the very plates I heard of,\" she said. \"Let me see,--five, six, eight,--a complete dozen, I declare, and all in good order,--and a platter, and two dishes! Well, this _is_ a find; and such lovely china, too,--I must have it. Mrs. Kinglake's,--that she's so proud of--isn't half so handsome; and _she_ has only eight plates. Now, where are those chairs that they told me about, I wonder?\"  Candace was sitting in one of the very chairs, as it proved; the other Mrs. Joy presently discovered in a little back-room which opened from the parlor, and which she lost no time in rummaging. She had just unlocked another closet door, and was standing before it with a pitcher in her hand, when the mistress of the house appeared,--a tall, thin, rather severe-looking woman, whose cheeks still wore the fresh color which cheeks retain till old age in the Narragansett country.  Candace, who had remained in her chair in a state of speechless and helpless dismay, watching Mrs. Joy's proceedings through the open door, saw her coming, but had no time to warn Mrs. Joy.  \"You wanted to see me on business?\" said Miss Colishaw, fixing a pair of wrathful eyes on Mrs. Joy, the pitcher, and the open door of the closet.  \"Oh, is it Miss Collisham?\" replied that lady, neither noticing nor caring for the very evident indignation of look and tone. \"Your little girl was so kind as to say that she would go and call you; and while we were waiting we thought we would look at this curious old--\"  \"We! are there more of you, then?\" demanded Miss Colishaw, glaring into the closet as if she expected to see other audacious visitors concealed in its depths. Finding none, she closed the door and turned its stout wooden button with a good deal of energy.  \"If you've any business with me, ma'am,\" she said, \"perhaps you'll be so kind as to step into the parlor and say what it is.\"  \"Certainly,\" responded Mrs. Joy, airily. \"But before we go do tell me about this curious old jug. It's Spode, is it not? I'm almost sure that it must be Spode, or some other of the very old English wares. Do you know about it?\"  \"I know that it was my mother's yeast-pitcher, and that's all that I care to know,\" replied Miss Colishaw, grimly, taking it out of her hand. \"I use it to keep corks in.\"  \"Corks! How amusing! But it's really a nice old piece, you know. I'd like to buy it if you don't care any more for it than that. You could put your corks in something else just as well.\"  \"It ain't for sale,\" said Miss Colishaw, decidedly, putting the pitcher again into the closet, and leading the way into the parlor.  Candace, who had heard all, and was feeling awkward and guilty to the last degree, rose as they entered, and courtesied to Miss Colishaw. Perhaps her face showed something of the shame and annoyance with which her heart was filled; for Miss Colishaw's iron expression relaxed a little, and the \"Good-afternoon\" she vouchsafed her sounded a shade less implacable.  \"Oh, I forgot!\" said Mrs. Joy, turning back to the rear room. \"There's this old chair, Miss Collisham.\"  \"_Colishaw_'s my name,\" interposed her hostess.  \"I beg your pardon, I'm sure; so it is, of course. Well, as I was saying, I noticed a delightful old arm-chair in this room,--ah, there it is! It exactly matches some without arms which I bought at Sypher's. If you'd like to part with this and the other in the front room, Miss--Miss Collishall, I should be glad to buy them; and I'd give you a very good price for them because of the match.\"  Miss Colishaw made no answer.  \"Then there's some china that I _observed_ in another closet,\" went on Mrs. Joy, returning again to the parlor, and opening the door of the closet in question. \"This red and blue, I mean. I see you have a good deal of it, and it's a kind I particularly fancy. It's like some which my dear old grandmother used to have.\" Mrs. Joy's tone became quite sentimental. \"I'd give almost anything for it, for the sake of old associations. I wish you'd fix a price on this, Miss Collisham.\"  \"Very well, then, I will,--one million of dollars,\" replied Miss Colishaw, losing all command over her temper. \"No, ma'am, I'm not joking. One million of dollars!--not a cent less; and not even that would pay me for my mother's china, and the chair my father used to sit in when he was old. They ain't for sale; and when I've said that once, I've said it for always.\"  \"But, my dear Miss Collishall--\"  \"I ain't your dear, and my name ain't Collishall. Colishaw's what I'm called; and it's a good old Newport name, though you don't seem to be able to remember it.\"  \"I beg your pardon,\" said Mrs. Joy, loftily. \"It's rather an unusual name, and I never happened to hear it till to-day. Then you don't care to sell any of these old things?\"  \"No, ma'am, not one thing.\"  \"Well, I must say that I consider you very foolish. This sort of old stuff won't always be the fashion; and the minute the fashion goes out, they won't be worth anything. Nobody will want to buy them.\"  \"They'll be worth just the same to _me_ then that they are now,\" responded Miss Colishaw, more gently. She evidently saw the hopelessness of trying to impress her point of view on Mrs. Joy.  \"I dare say you have an attic-full of delightful old spinning-wheels and things,\" remarked that lady, quick to mark the change of tone and hoping to profit by it. She glanced toward the stair-foot as she spoke. Miss Colishaw quickly stepped in front of the stairs, and stood there with the air of an ancient Roman defending his household gods.  \"Yes, ma'am, I _have_ an attic,\" she said dryly. \"It's a very good attic, and it's stuffed full of old things. There's a fender and two pairs of fire-dogs--\"  Mrs. Joy's eyes sparkled. \"Oh, do let us go up and see it!\" she cried.  \"No, you don't!\" said Miss Colishaw, taking a firmer grasp of the baluster. \"There's a wool-wheel, and a flax-wheel, and a winder, and three warming-pans--\"  \"Dear me! What a delightful place!\" put in Mrs. Joy.  \"There's lots and lots of old truck,\" continued the implacable Miss Colishaw. \"It all belonged to my mother and my grandmother and her mother before her. It's all up there; and there it's going to stay, if all the rich ladies in Newport come down to try to wheedle me out of it. Not a soul of them shall set foot in my attic.\"  \"Well, I must say that I think you very foolish,\" said Mrs. Joy, settling the wrists of her long gloves. \"You're very poor, and these old things are no use to you in the way you live; and you'd far better take the money they would bring, and make yourself comfortable.\"  Miss Colishaw was now pale with anger.  \"And who told you I was poor?\" she demanded. \"Did I ever come a-begging to you? Did I ever walk into your house to pry and rummage, and tell you that your things were no use? When I do you'll have a right to come here and behave as you have, but not a minute before. Use! They _are_ of use. They remind me of my family,--of the time I was young, when we all lived in this house together, before Newport grew to be a fashionable boarding-place and was spoiled for people of the old sort. If that's all the business you have with me, madam, I think we have got through with it.\"  \"Really, there's no occasion for being so very rude,\" said Mrs. Joy.  \"Rude!\" Miss Colishaw gave an acrid laugh. \"Mine ain't fashionable manners, I know; but I guess they're about as good.\" She opened the front door, and held it suggestively wide. Mrs. Joy swept through.  \"Come, Miss Arden,\" she called back over her shoulder.  Candace could do nothing but look as apologetic as she felt. \"I'm so sorry,\" she murmured, as she passed Miss Colishaw.  \"You haven't done anything. It's she who ought to be sorry,\" returned Miss Colishaw, and banged the door behind her as she passed through.  \"What a horrid old person!\" said Mrs. Joy, who looked heated and vexed. \"I never met any one so impertinent. And such a fool, too! Why, she takes in sewing, I am told, or makes cake,--some of those things. She's as poor as Job's turkey; yet there she sits, with those valuable things absolutely wasting in her poky old house, and refuses to sell them. I wish I had spoken more strongly to her! I declare, I've a good mind to go back and do it now. It is such perfect folly. She really ought to be reasoned out of it.\"  \"Oh, I wouldn't,\" urged Candace,--\"I wouldn't go back. She was _so_ angry. I don't know what she would say if you did.\"  \"My dear, I don't care a red cent what she says. All the old women on the Point can't frighten _me_,\" declared Mrs. Joy. She reflected a little; then she gave up her intention.  \"After all, it isn't worth the trouble. She's just that sort of obstinate old creature who will never listen to a word of advice. I knew, the moment I looked at her, that nothing I could say would do any good. Generally I can turn that kind of person round my finger. Why, you'd be surprised if I told you of the bargains I have got out of old garrets over on Conanicut and down the Island. But, really and truly, I'm a little tired of it; and I never did care much for such old duds, except that other people have them and it is the thing to have them. I'd rather go to Howard's any day, and get a lot of nice French china. Howard has such exquisite things always.\"  So the carriage was ordered to Coddington's Cove; and as they rolled smoothly past the Maitland Woods, neither Mrs. Joy nor Candace guessed that at that moment Miss Colishaw was sitting in her little back-room, with the old yeast-pitcher in her lap, crying as if her heart would break.  \"It's bad enough to be old and poor and alone in the world,\" she sobbed to herself, \"without having fine stuck-up folks coming right in to sauce you out of your senses.\" She wiped her eyes, and looked for a minute at the pitcher.  \"Betsey Colishaw, you're a fool!\" she remarked aloud. \"You might have kept your temper. The woman didn't hurt you any. And there was that young thing looking so kind of sorry. You might have said a pleasant word to her, anyhow, even if you were all riled up with the other.\"  On sped the carriage, the lovely Upper Bay always in sight, until on the curve of the long Coddington's Point it turned, and retraced its course so as to strike Washington Street at the lower end. It was a delicious afternoon. The tide was flowing freshly in, and the brisk northwest breeze which met it sent little white-caps dancing all over the surface. Crafts of all kinds were traversing the harbor: yachts and cat-boats were out in numbers; schooners and barges sped up the bay, their sails shining against the green Island shores; row-boats and steam-tugs were crossing and recrossing between the city and the Fort and Torpedo Station. A sharp double whistle announced the \"Eolus\" just started on her up trip, with a long wake of creamy foam behind her. Fleets of white clouds were drifting across the sky, which was bluer than the sea, like ships of heaven, simulating and repeating the movements of those of earth below. Every wharf and dock was full of people, fishing, idling, or preparing to go out in boats. It was one of the moments when all mankind seems to be a-pleasuring, and to have laid aside all memory of the labors and the pains of this work-a-day world.  Mrs. Joy probably felt that she owed Candace some compensation for the unpleasant quarter of an hour which she had led her into at Miss Colishaw's; for she did her best to be entertaining, and to tell everything that she herself knew about Washington Street and its notabilities. She pointed out the two pretty old houses which have been so cleverly modernized into comfort without any sacrifice of their quaint exteriors; and the other and still finer one, once belonging to the Hunter family, whose renovations have gone so far toward spoiling it.  \"It used to have a nice old staircase with a broad landing, and windows over the water, and beautiful mahogany balusters,\" explained Mrs. Joy. \"But they've spoiled all that. They have painted over the elegant satinwood and old cherry wainscotings, and taken out the secret staircase; and now it's no better than any other square house with that kind of roof.\"  \"Was there a secret staircase?\" cried Candace. \"Oh, what a pity they took it out! I always thought I should like to see one so much.\"  \"I don't believe this would have interested you particularly. It was only a kind of narrow back-stairs, which was not commonly used. They do say, though, that ghosts used to be heard running up and down it quite often.\"  \"Ghosts! How strange! What sort of noise did they make? I suppose no one ever saw them.\"  \"One lady did.\"  \"Really!\" Candace's eyes were wide with attention.  \"Yes. She was a friend of mine, and she used to board in the house before it was altered. She heard the noises, which were a sort of scratching and rustling, and she resolved to see what the ghost was like; so she took a candle and followed it downstairs.\"  \"How brave! And what was it like?\"  \"It was like--a rat! When she caught sight of it, it was sitting on the edge of a pot of lard. It was picking its teeth, she said.\"  \"A pot of lard!\"  \"Yes. The secret staircase led down to a sort of cellar, you see.\"  \"Oh, Mrs. Joy, how disappointing!\"  \"I'm afraid ghost stories generally do turn out disappointing in the end. Here we are, close to old Fort Greene. Would you like to jump out, and run down to the water's edge and see it?\"  \"Oh, thank you, I should like it ever so much.\"  It was but a few steps from the carriage to the grassy top of the old redoubt; but when Cannie had picked her way down the steep incline toward the shore, she found herself entirely out of sight of the street and the houses, out of sight of everything except the lovely sunlit Bay which stretched before her. There was no sound except the plash of the waves, and for a moment she felt as much alone as if she had been in the depths of a country solitude. Then another sound came vaguely to her ear,--a low murmur of conversation; and she became aware that the Fort held other visitors besides herself. A rock hid the speakers from her, whoever they might be; the voices were too indistinct for recognition, and it was accident rather than intention which led her to diverge from the path, as she returned to the carriage, in a manner which gave her a view of the party.  There were three persons,--a man and two girls. The man was young and good-looking; he was also well dressed, but there was something about him which, even to Candace's inexperience, suggested the idea that he was not quite a gentleman. One of the girls was standing with her back to Candace, talking eagerly in a hushed voice; the other sat on a stone in an attitude of troubled dejection. Her face was in shadow; but she turned a little as Candace passed, and to her wondering surprise she saw that it was no other than her cousin Georgie Gray.     CHAPTER IX.  PERPLEXED.   CANDACE paused for a second, surprised and hesitating; then she walked on again. Georgie had not seemed to observe her. The other girl was doubtless Berry Joy, with whom she was less at ease than with anybody else. She felt not the least desire to confront her, and a strange man to boot; besides, Mrs. Joy must not be kept waiting.  \"That looks like Berry's village cart,\" exclaimed Mrs. Joy, as they drove past a side street where a little vehicle stood drawn up in the shade under the care of a natty groom. \"Was that James and the cart, Wilkins?\"  \"Yes, ma'am, I believe it was.\"  \"I wonder where the girls can be,\" continued Mrs. Joy. \"At the Parishes', most likely, taking afternoon tea. That's a very favorite place at sunset with all the young people. There is such a wide piazza, and a splendid view.\" Having said this, she dismissed the subject from her mind.  They lingered so long in Thames Street, over various errands, that it was nearly dinner-time before Candace reached home. Georgie was there before her; she still had her bonnet on, and was sitting on the piazza with her mother and Gertrude, giving an account of her afternoon.  \"And then we drove down to the Old Point, and called on the Parishes,\" she concluded; \"and, mamma, as we came away Miss Gisborne saw us from her window, and called out that I was to tell you that Mr.--somebody--Card--Caird--some Englishman, at all events--was coming to-morrow, and would you please be sure to lunch with her on Wednesday and meet him?\"  \"Caird, the artist? yes, I know. Miss Gisborne was expecting him.\"  Georgie seemed to have finished her narrative. She had not said a word about Fort Greene.  \"Now, Candace, what are your adventures?\" demanded Gertrude. \"It is quite exciting, after a dull afternoon on the sofa, to have you all come in and tell me what you have been about. I watched you drive away with a face like a frightened kitten.\"  \"You would have seen me looking a great deal more frightened if you had been with us at Miss Colishaw's,\" said Candace; and she proceeded to relate what had happened, in a quiet, demure way which was particularly funny, throwing in a little unconscious mimicry which made the scene real to her audience. Miss Colishaw's grim indignation, Mrs. Joy's cool audacity, her own compunctious helplessness,--all were indicated in turn. Before she had done, they were in fits of indignant laughter.  \"Well, really, I did not think even Mrs. Joy could behave so outrageously as that,\" remarked Gertrude.  \"It is really too bad,\" said Mrs. Gray. \"Miss Colishaw is one of the salt of the earth, always working herself to death for anybody who is sick or in trouble, or poorer than herself. I am afraid her feelings were really hurt. She is sensitive about her poverty, and has a great regard for her old family relics. I feared that there might be some mistake about her wishing to sell her china when Mrs. Joy spoke about it; but it is a long time since I saw the old lady, and I thought it possible that something had occurred to make her glad of the money. I am really shocked at Mrs. Joy.\"  \"If only I could have seen her at the cupboard, with the yeast-pitcher in her hand, and Miss Colishaw's face!\" cried Gertrude, with another burst of laughter. \"Well, after this truly awful interview what did you do next, Candace?\"  \"We drove to Coddington's Cove, and then we came back to Washington Street, and Mrs. Joy told me about the old houses; and then she stopped the carriage by old Fort Greene, and I went down to the shore to look at it.\"  \"Did you?\" said Georgie with sudden interest; \"why--why, Berry and I were there too. We ran down for a moment.\"  \"I thought I saw you,\" said Candace, simply.  She was looking straight at Georgie as she spoke, and was surprised to see her flush suddenly, and then turn as suddenly pale. Her change of color was so marked that her mother could scarcely have failed to notice it, had her attention not been for the moment occupied by Frederic, who just brought out a note which required an answer. Gertrude was looking another way; only Candace noticed Georgie's unwonted emotion. Nothing more was said about Fort Greene at the time; but a little later, when she was in her room smoothing her hair for dinner, Georgie tapped at the door.  \"Cannie,\" she said, \"I'm going to ask you not to say anything more to anybody about having seen Berry and me on Washington Street to-day.\"  \"Certainly, I won't,\" replied Candace, making in her surprise one of those hasty promises which are so often repented of afterward; \"but why not?\"  \"Oh, well, there are no very important reasons; it's just that I would rather you wouldn't.\"  \"Very well.\" But Candace felt vaguely dissatisfied with this explanation, and a little curious.  She thought of this promise, and of Georgie's odd manner of exacting it from her, as she fell asleep that night, and again the next morning; but gradually it faded from her mind, until, about ten days later, something occurred to revive the remembrance. Mrs. Joy called to ask two of the girls to drive with Berry and herself to see the polo play. Gertrude happened to be out; so Candace fell heir to her share of the invitation. Mrs. Gray was glad to have her go. She herself did not often visit the Polo Ground, and she thought Candace would enjoy seeing a match, and that it would be something pleasant for her to remember.  The Polo Ground is a large enclosure to the south of Spring Street, and well out of the town. It is shut in by a high paling, built with the intention of excluding every one who does not pay for the pleasure of witnessing the game. Nature, however,--that free-handed dame,--has frustrated this precaution by providing, close to the paling, a little rocky bluff, or rise of land, not owned by the Polo Association, whose top commands a clear view over the fence; and on polo days this point of vantage is usually well filled by on-lookers of an impecunious description. There was quite a little crowd on the brow of \"Deadhead Hill,\" as it is called, when Mrs. Joy's carriage turned in at the gates; and she glanced that way and said, \"It is really too bad about that hill!\" in a dissatisfied tone, as if the enjoyment of these non-subscribers jarred in some way, or interfered with the pleasure for which she herself was forced to pay a round price.  Inside the gate appeared a large railed enclosure, with a wicket at either end; and about this carriages full of gay people were drawn up in rows, two or three abreast. The ponies which were to be used in the game were being led up and down on the farther side of the ground, where was a range of out-buildings. Presently a bell rang. There was a little confusion of unblanketing and mounting, and eight riders armed with long mallets rode forward. Four wore red caps, and four blue; and the two colors ranged themselves opposite each other at the wickets. The umpire tossed a little ball into the middle of the ground, and the game began.  Candace was at first rather inclined to laugh at the riders, who were so much too tall for their little steeds that in some cases their legs seemed in danger of hitting the ground; but before long she had become so interested in the game and the bold riding that she no longer felt inclined to laugh. The object of each side was to drive the ball through its own wicket; and to effect this a great deal of both courage and skill were required, not only on the part of the horsemen, but of the ponies as well. More than once all the eight seemed to be collected in a breathless tangle about and above the ball, crowding, pushing, struggling for the chance at a stroke; and in such cases the ponies seemed to divide the excitement with their masters, and fenced and curved and described indescribably short circles, regardless of the danger of getting a hard rap from the cruel mallets on their own poor little hoofs. Then, when some lucky hit sent the ball spinning across the ground, it was quite beautiful to see the alacrity with which the little creatures, of their own accord, as it were, rushed, after it, obeying the slightest indication from rein or spur, and apparently measuring the distance and the opportunities as accurately as their riders. The beat of their small hoofs on the smooth ground was so swift and even that it was more like a rustle than a rush. To and fro flew the ball, now almost at the blue wicket, then reached and sent back in the very nick of time by one of the red champions. Candace was so fascinated that she had no eyes for any one else till, turning her head by accident, her eye lighted upon a face in the crowd near the carriage; and with a flash of recognition she knew that it was the stranger of whom she had caught that momentary glimpse at Fort Greene. Involuntarily she glanced at Berry Joy and Georgie, and perceived that the former had seen the man also and was trying to look as if she had not seen him, while the latter was honestly unconscious. There was something odd about the man's manner, which kept Candace's attention fixed. He seemed to be standing carelessly among other spectators watching the game, and yet by a series of dexterous movements and small shiftings of position he was gradually edging toward the carriage. Presently a forward step more decided than the rest brought him close to it. Georgie saw him now. A deep color flushed her face; she lowered her parasol as if to hide it.  \"I believe you dropped this, madam,\" said the man, stooping suddenly as if to pick something up from the ground, and handing to Berry what seemed to be a note.  \"Oh, thanks!\" said Berry, in a confused voice, quite different from her ordinary voice.  The stranger raised his hat formally, and moved aside.  \"What was that?\" asked Mrs. Joy, who had been watching the game and had seen nothing of this by-play. \"Did you drop something, Berry?\"  \"Only a note from Julia Prime,\" answered Berry, slipping the paper in her pocket.  \"It was very civil of that person, whoever he was,\" said Mrs. Joy, unsuspiciously.  Berry and Georgie exchanged looks. Candace was at a loss what to think.  There are few better keepers of secrets than shy people. They do not let things out by accident, as talkative persons do; it is easier for them to be silent than to talk, to keep counsel than to betray it. But apart from being shy, Candace's instincts were honorable. She had a lady-like distaste of interfering with other people's affairs or seeming to pry into them. She said not a word to any one about this matter of the Polo Ground, and she tried not to think about it; although it was not in human nature not to feel a little curiosity, and she caught herself observing Georgie rather more than usual, though without intending it.  This quickened observation showed her two things: first, that Georgie had something on her mind; and secondly, that she was determined not to show it. She laughed and talked rather more than was her custom; and if the laughter was a little forced, no one else seemed to find it out. There were times when Candace almost persuaded herself that the whole thing was the effect of her own imagination, which had exaggerated something that was perfectly commonplace into importance simply because she did not understand it; and then again she doubted, and was sure that Georgie was not like her usual self.  So another week went by, and brought them to September. There was no sign of autumn as yet. Every leaf was as green and fresh on its bough, every geranium as bright on its stalk, as if summer were just beginning instead of just ended. But with the presage which sends the bird southward long before the cold is felt, and teaches the caterpillar to roll its cocoon and the squirrel to make ready its winter's nest and store of nuts, the gay summer crowd began to melt away. Every day brought a lessened list of arrivals at the hotels; and already there was that sense of a season over and done with and about to be laid up and shelved for the winter, which all watering-places know so well, and which is as a nipping frost to the hopes of landlords and letters of lodgings. Just why \"Finis\" should be written so early on the fair page of the Newport season, it is hard to explain; for, charming as is the summer, September and October are more charming still, and nowhere does the later autumn exhibit a more indulgent mood, holding back the winter till the last possible moment, and sometimes coaxing summer to aid and abet with supplies of greenery and flowers, till the New Year comes to put an end to the merry game.  Mr. Gray began to go to town in the Sunday-night boat for two or three days of business, though he still spent the larger half of the week in Newport. Marian was sent to Lenox for a week's visit to an aunt. The family seemed very small now; and when Mrs. Gray one Monday morning announced her intention of running up to Boston next day for the night and taking Gertrude with her, Georgie loudly protested.  \"It is really cruel of you, mamma. Cannie and I will feel like two deserted little scraps, all alone in this big house. I do think you might wait till papa is at home. And there's Marian coming back to-morrow night. What on earth shall we do with her all day? She will feel dreadfully to find you gone.\"  \"I am sorry about Marian,\" confessed Mrs. Gray; \"but Tuesday happens to be the best day for us on several accounts. You and Candace must be particularly good to her, and not let her feel aggrieved or forlorn. I have ordered the breakfasts and luncheons and dinner for to-morrow and Wednesday, so you will have no housekeeping to trouble you, and we shall be back at six o'clock, you know. Two days are but a short time, after all. You might ask a couple of girls to dine with you to-morrow,--any one you like.\"  But Georgie seemed out of spirits. She was dull and dreamy, and said she didn't care to invite anybody,--she would rather have a nice lazy time by themselves, if Candace liked it just as well. Candace, who had made up her mind to the inevitable Berry Joy, was glad to be let off; so she spent a very quiet day, for Georgie went to her room as soon as lunch was over, to lie down, as she said, and sleep off a little headache, and Candace was left alone till nearly dinner-time.  Marian's arrival from the train brought a little stir and variety; but it was not of the most pleasurable kind, for she was so disappointed and indignant at finding her mother absent, that till the first sharp sting of vexation had abated, nothing could be got out of her but sobs and broken words of complaint. Even when she grew calmer, things were still rather melancholy; for she was too tired and depressed for speech, and just sat in silence, leaning her head against Candace's shoulder until bedtime. Nor did Georgie and Candace find much to say to each other after she had departed. Georgie remarked, rather peevishly, that Marian was a most cross, tiresome child sometimes, and Candace said, \"Yes, poor little thing! but she was really very tired this time, as well as cross;\" then each took a book and read to herself till ten o'clock, when they separated with a brief good-night. It was a great contrast to the usual bright, cheerful evenings of the household; and Cannie, as she undressed, was conscious of being low-spirited. \"Homesick\" she would have called it; but the phrase did not justly express her mood, for even on that dull evening I am very sure that she did not pine for Aunt Myra, or for the North Tolland farm-house, which was the only place she had ever called by the name of home.  The next day opened more brightly. Marian was asked to lunch with the Frewens, who were her favorite friends; and her absence was something of a relief to the others. Georgie and Candace did their little morning tasks, not forgetting the arrangement of the fresh flowers, which usually fell to Gertrude's share; then Georgie sat down to practise, and Candace settled herself in a deep cushioned chair in the library with Motley's \"Dutch Republic,\" which she was reading for the first time. It was the chapter on the siege of Leyden; and the wild, fantastic nocturne by Chopin which Georgie was playing, seemed to blend and mix itself with the tragic narrative. Candace did not know how long the reading and the music had been going on, each complementing the other. She was so absorbed in her book as not to heed the sound of the bell or Frederic's noiseless tread as he crossed the hall to answer it; but she roused from her absorption as the nocturne came suddenly to an end with a crash of startled chords, and Georgie's hands fell from the keys, at the sight of Berry Joy, who came hurriedly in at the door. Candace in her corner was invisible.  \"Oh, Georgie, that dreadful creature is here again,\" she heard Berry say, while Georgie answered with a little despairing cry, \"Not really! oh, Berry, what shall we do?\" Then came a long whispered confabulation; then another tinkle at the door-bell.  \"Frederic, I am engaged,\" Georgie called out.--\"Come upstairs, Berry. If we stay here, some one is certain to break in.\" The two rushed across the hall. Candace heard their rapid steps on the stairs; then Georgie's door shut with a bang, and all was still.  Her book dropped into her lap unheeded. Her mind was full of puzzled amazement. Who was the \"dreadful creature,\" and what _did_ it all mean?  The silence in the house was unbroken except by the tick-tick of the tall clock. It made her nervous at last, and she went out on the lawn to get rid of the sensation. She picked a few flowers, pulled the seed-pods from one of the geraniums under her care, and spent some minutes in petting and fondling Marian's pretty colly, who lay stretched out luxuriously in the full rays of the mild September sunshine. Then she caught a glimpse of Berry's figure passing out of the gate, and went back to the house. The drawing-room was empty. Motley lay on the floor where she had dropped him. She picked up the volume, and slowly mounted the stairs. As she passed through the upper entry she heard a sound from the morning-room; was it a sob? Candace gently approached the door. Again the sound came, an unmistakable sob; and looking in she saw Georgie, lying on her mother's sofa with her face hidden, sobbing as if her heart would break, and saying over and over to herself in a voice which was like a moan, \"What shall I do? oh, what shall I do?\"     CHAPTER X.  A WORD FITLY SPOKEN.   ALL Candace's timidity fled at the sight of Georgie's distress. She hurried across the room, knelt down by the sofa, and took her cousin's hand, which was as cold as a stone, between her own warm ones.  \"What is it, Georgie? Don't cry so, Georgie, dear, please don't! Oh, what is the matter?\" she said, in a voice so soft and affectionate and pleading, that it made its way straight to poor miserable Georgie's heart. She still sobbed; she still hid her face in the pillow; but she let Cannie hold her hand and stroke and kiss it, and seemed to find a little soothing in the kind touch and the tender words.  After a while the sobs grew fainter, and Georgie lay half exhausted, with her eyes shut, only now and then giving Cannie's hand a squeeze. Hers was one of those natures which cannot bear to suffer alone. Whatever was the matter, Georgie instinctively reached out for sympathy to the nearest source from which it could be had. Gertrude, her natural confidante, was away; and Candace, her sweet face full of pity and concern, was close at hand. Her touch felt warm and comforting; her tender voice was irresistible to Georgie's desolate mood. She turned her wet face with a sudden burst of gratitude and trust toward the little cousin whom she had till now held so cheaply, and who, at that moment, seemed the only friend left within reach.  \"Cannie,\" she said, \"I've a great mind to tell you--\" Then she stopped.  Confidence is like a timid bird, which hops nearer and nearer to the hand that holds out a crumb, but all the while keeps its wings half poised for flight, should a gesture alarm it. Candace had the instinctive wisdom of a loving heart. She did not interrupt Georgie with a word; only her anxious eyes asked the questions which her tongue did not utter.  \"I am in such trouble,\" said Georgie, thawing more and more under the influence of Cannie's silence and Cannie's look,--\"in such a dreadful scrape! Oh, what will become of me?\" wringing her hands. \"You are so good, Cannie,--so kind. Will you promise not to breathe a word to anybody if I tell you all about it?\"  \"Yes,\" said Candace, \"I promise.\"  \"I know you can keep a secret,\" continued Georgie, sighing heavily; \"you never said a word about that time at Fort Greene, yet I know you must have wondered what it all meant.\" A little pause; then she went on: \"There really wasn't any harm in it when it began. It was last winter. One day Berry and I had been laughing over some of the 'Personals' in the 'Herald,' and just for fun we wrote one ourselves and sent it to the paper. It was an advertisement. We pretended it came from a lady who wanted to make the acquaintance of an eligible gentleman with a view to matrimony. We made it as ridiculous as we could, and we signed it 'Laura,' and said that all the answers could be sent to the Station D Post-office.\"  \"And did you get any answers?\"  \"Oh, quantities! I never imagined that people could be so foolish. Why, there were a hundred and thirty the very first day, and ever so many afterward. Some of them were sentimental, and some of them were ridiculous, and some were really funny. I think the funny ones came from people who suspected that the advertisement was a hoax; but we got a great deal of amusement out of it, and we never for a moment dreamed that any one would suspect who put it in. Oh, how I wish we never had; for it brought that horrible man down upon us, and since then we have never had any peace of our lives.\"  \"What horrible man?\" asked Candace, more and more surprised.  \"You saw him at Fort Greene. I don't know who he is myself, really. He says his name is James Alexander, but he tells such frightful lies that I don't believe it is his real name at all. He is a dreadful creature, and he has treated us so--\" Georgie broke down into another fit of crying.  \"But I don't understand,\" said Candace. \"How could he treat you badly? How did he come to know you? What right had he to speak to you at all?\"  \"Oh, no right!\" explained Georgie, quivering with sobs. \"It was only that he found out about the advertisement, and then he frightened us. He suspected something, and hung about the post-office and watched, till one time when Berry and I went to get the 'Laura' letters. Then he followed us home, and found out where we both lived, and wrote to say that he had become possessed of our secret, and that he was a poor man in need of money, and if we would at once send him twenty-five dollars he would keep silent about it; but if not, he should feel bound to write to our friends, and let them know what we had been doing. We were both scared to death at this threat, and we made haste to send him the money, hoping that he would keep his word, and that we should never hear of him again. But we might have known better; for the very next week he wrote again, demanding fifty. And so it has gone on ever since. He never gives us any peace. We have to send him all he asks for, or else he declares he will call on papa, and not only tell him about the advertisement, but all sorts of horrible things which are not true at all. He won't believe that it was only to amuse ourselves that we sent the notice to the paper, and he hints the most dreadful things, and says papa and Mrs. Joy will be sure to believe him! Berry and I have grown so afraid that we would give a million, if we had it, to bribe him to go away and never let us hear from him again. But even that would be no use, for he would come back and demand another million,\" ended poor Georgie.  \"And he actually comes up to Newport, and follows you about, and makes you give him money!\" said Candace, horror-stricken at this glimpse of the hidden suffering endured by these two prosperous, cared-for girls, who were supposed to be without a sorrow in the world.  \"Indeed, he does. He came that time when you saw him, the middle of August; and he wrote Berry a note to say that he must speak to us, and that if we didn't meet him somewhere, he should appeal to Mrs. Joy. We had to consent, of course, and we gave him all the money we had, and we thought he was gone; but just a few days after he appeared again on the Polo Ground, and handed Berry a note, which he pretended she had dropped out of the carriage. But it was really from himself; and he said that he had lost the money we gave him on a bet which had turned out badly, and he must have a hundred dollars more. You can't think how hard it has been for us to raise all this money, Cannie. Berry has her own income, but her mother likes to know what she does with it; and mamma chooses my things for me, so I don't have much of an allowance. We have been at our wits' end sometimes to know how to manage.\"  \"And how did you?\"  \"Berry sold a diamond ring which she doesn't often wear, so her mother has not missed it, and I put in thirty dollars, which was all I had; and he went away, for good as we hoped. He promised solemnly not to come to Newport, or ask us for money again this season; and we were so relieved. For a few days I was almost happy,\" with a miserable little laugh. \"But what fools we were to believe him! I can't imagine why we should, for he has deceived us all through. I don't think he has spoken the truth once from the very beginning. Berry came just now to tell me that he is back already. She saw him herself this morning in Thames Street. He didn't see her, for she was in the close coup, and he was looking in at a shop window; but, of course, he has come for money, and neither of us has any more. We shall have to refuse, and he will go straight to papa, and then--oh, what will become of me?\" She buried her face again in the pillows.  Candace was trembling with a mixture of sensations,--pity for her cousin, indignation at this mean persecution of which she was the victim, and withal a fine touch of scorn over the weakness which was so easily played upon. With all her country breeding and ignorance of the world and its ways, there was in our little maiden a large share of the strong, self-respecting pride of her ancestry. _She_ would never have stooped to buy the silence of a low knave like this Alexander; and her clear truthfulness of soul indicated at once the single, straight, unerring clew which could lead out of this labyrinth of difficulties.  \"Georgie,\" she said, after a moment's thought, \"there is just one thing for you to do. You must tell Cousin Kate all about this.\"  \"Oh, Candace, never!\" screamed Georgie. \"Tell mamma! Have mamma know! I'd rather die at once. You have no idea how she despises concealments and deceits; and I have had to plot and contrive, almost to tell lies, all through this wretched time. She would never get over it. Even if she _said_ she forgave me, I should always read a sort of contempt in her eyes whenever she looked at me. Oh, mamma, mamma! And I love her so! Candace, I couldn't.\"  \"It is the only way,\" repeated Candace, firmly.  \"You have promised not to tell!\" exclaimed her cousin, starting up from her recumbent position. \"You promised me solemnly! You'll not forget that, will you, Cannie? You'll not tell mother yourself?\"  \"Certainly not. What use would it be for me to tell her? It would be only next best to having Alexander do it. But you,--you, Georgie,--that is a different thing.\"  \"Even Gertrude said she couldn't advise me to tell mamma,\" continued Georgie.  \"Gertrude! Does Gertrude know about it then?\"  \"Yes; I had to tell somebody, I was so miserable. It was only a little while ago that I told her. I kept it to myself for a long time.\"  \"Gertrude!\" repeated Candace, unable to hide her amazement. \"And what did she say?\"  \"Oh, she was horrified, of course. Any one would be; and she threw a great deal of blame on Berry. I don't think she has ever liked her since. She always goes out of the room when she comes. She wanted me to do all sorts of impossible things, such as going to the chief of police. But about mamma, she felt just as I did. You see we both think so much of mamma, Cannie; we care so much about having her approve of us. You haven't any mother; so perhaps you can't understand.\"  \"No,\" said Candace, \"I have no mother. Perhaps it makes a difference. But there is another thing I can't understand, and that is how girls who _have_ a mother--such a mother as yours, Georgie--can be content to keep her love by means of a cheat. If I did have a mother, I should want her to know all about me, and approve of me honestly, not because I was hiding things from her. Besides,\"--there was a little choke here,--\"I think mothers can stand a good deal, and still keep on loving their children. I don't believe Cousin Kate would be hard on you, Georgie, or despise you because you have been foolish.\"  \"You don't half know mamma,\" repeated Georgie. \"She has such high ideas about conduct. It would half kill her to know that I had even spoken to a man like this Alexander.\"  \"Of course she would be sorry,\" persisted Candace. \"Of course she would rather that you had never got into this scrape. But she is so just always, as well as kind. She always sees both sides. She will understand how it began,--that Berry over-persuaded you--\"  \"What makes you say that?\" interrupted Georgie. \"I never told you that Berry over-persuaded me.\"  \"No; but I knew it all the same. It's a matter of course,\" said Candace, too deeply in earnest to pick her words, or realize what a very uncomplimentary thing she was saying, \"Berry Joy always makes you do whatever she likes. Cousin Kate will realize how it was in a minute.\"  \"Well, never mind that. I want to talk about mamma. Don't you see that if I did tell her she couldn't do anything unless she told papa? and that is the very thing I want to prevent. Oh, what was that?\" as the clock began to strike. \"Six! They will be here in ten minutes. Oh, dear! how can I meet her? My eyes are swelled out of my head. She will be sure to notice.\" And Georgie hurried to the looking-glass, and began to smooth the tangled fluffs of hair on her forehead.  Cannie's heart was hot within her, but she wisely forbore further remonstrance. She brought a basin of water and a sponge, and helped Georgie to bathe and cool her tear-stained face, and to arrange her dishevelled locks. Then she kissed her softly, and moved across the room to the window. Georgie stole after her, and stood by her side. It was nearly time for the travellers to arrive from the train. A cool sea-wind was stirring. Through the trees a red glow could be seen in the west, where the sun was nearing the horizon.  There was a sound of wheels, and the Frewens' village-cart drove rapidly in and set Marian down on the porch. As it drove away, another carriage met and passed it at the gate. It was the coup, and Mrs. Gray and Gertrude were inside. With a shriek of joy Marian shot down the gravel walk to meet them. John stopped his horses, Mrs. Gray jumped out, and Marian sprang into her arms. The lookers-on at the window above could see the whole pretty picture,--the lovely sunny-faced mother, the glad child; they could hear Mrs. Gray's sweet laugh as she bent over and kissed Marian again and again.  \"Oh, Georgie, Georgie,\" cried Candace, her eyes suddenly brimming over with tears, \"look at that, look at them! Was there ever any one so sweet and loving and dear as Cousin Kate? See how she holds Marian in her arms, how she kisses her! How _can_ you be afraid of her? How can you doubt one minute that she loves you enough to forgive anything? Oh, if I had such a mother, would I stay away from her, and cheat and conceal, and trust a girl like Berry Joy, and a bad man like this Alexander, and not trust her?--not go to her first of all for help and advice? Think how good and kind she is, how glad to help everybody,--poor people, servants; think how lovely she has been to me,--and, of course, she loves you a hundred times more! How can you hesitate one minute? Oh, go straight to her, dear, dear Georgie; tell her all about it, your own self. She will know just what to do. She will make it all right for you. Think how happy you will be not to be afraid of anything any more. Oh, Georgie, do, do!\"  \"Why, Candace, I hardly know you,\" faltered Georgie; and she spoke truly, for Candace in her intense eagerness seemed to grow out of and beyond herself, and looked taller, older, quite unlike the shy Candace of every day. Then the passion of her appeal caught hold of Georgie's weakness. Deep feeling is contagious, and there are moments when cowards become temporarily brave. Candace's rush of words, her mother's tender look and attitude as she held Marian close to her, or, it may be, some swift impulse from her good angel, seemed to melt her out of her mood of resistance. How it happened she could not have told, she never could tell; but a sudden strength came to her, and the next moment she was out in the hall. Mrs. Gray, slowly coming upstairs, was clasped in a wild, despairing embrace.  \"Oh, mamma! I want you. Oh, mamma! I've something to tell you,\" cried Georgie. Her mother, whose smile had changed to a look of pale amazement, could not speak. She suffered herself to be swept away. The door of Georgie's room closed behind them; and Gertrude, who was following close behind, was left on the landing to confront the equally surprised Candace.  \"What is it? What is Georgie going to say to mamma?\" demanded Gertrude, in a frightened whisper.  \"She is going to tell her about that horrible man who has been making her so unhappy,\" replied Candace.  \"Going to tell mamma! oh, how did she ever get courage?\"  \"I begged her--I told her it was the only way.\"  \"You! why, Cannie, how did you dare?\" cried Gertrude. \"I never would have ventured to do that.\"  \"So Georgie said,\" replied Candace, simply; \"but I was sure the thing to do was for her to go straight to Cousin Kate.\"     CHAPTER XI.  FIVE AND ONE MAKE SIX.   A LONG hush followed these few words of explanation. Gertrude was too stunned to ask further questions. Mechanically she moved toward her room, and took off her hat and coat; but all the time she was washing her hands and smoothing her hair, her ears were strained for sounds from Georgie's room, which was next her own. There was very little to be heard,--only a low, continuous murmur of conversation, broken now and then by a louder word; but all so subdued that Candace, sitting on the staircase seat, caught nothing. Marian, rushing up after her mother, had been stopped by the explanation that Georgie was not well, and wanted to be alone with mamma. After a little natural outburst of impatience, she too seemed to catch the vague sense of crisis that was in the air, and settled down quietly, with her head on Candace's knee, to wait.  It was a long waiting. The red sunset sky faded into pallor, and the stars came out. Gertrude, restless with suspense, joined the other two. Both she and Candace were too nervous for ordinary talk, and Marian's presence precluded any mention of the subject with which their thoughts were full; so the trio sat mostly in silence. Frederic was heard to pass down the upper entry and announce dinner; but Mrs. Gray only answered by the word \"Presently,\" and did not open the door. The shadows grew darker as the dusk deepened, till after a while the gas in the hall was lighted, when they fled to the remoter corners, and consoled themselves by casting an added blackness wherever they were permitted to fall,--the only consolation possible to shadows.  To the anxious watchers on the window bench the time seemed very long; and in fact it was nearly eight o'clock before Georgie's door was heard to open, and Mrs. Gray to pass across the hall to her own room. She only stayed there a few minutes. The girls sprang up to receive her as she came downstairs, and the older ones looked anxiously in her face. She was tired and paler than usual, and her eyes showed that she had been crying; but her smile was brave and clear as she put her arm round Candace, and gave her a long kiss.  \"You must be half starved, my dears,\" she said. \"Georgie has a bad headache, and I have sent her to bed. She won't come down again to-night; we will have dinner at once.\"  They went to dinner, accordingly. Marian held fast to her mother's hand; but Mrs. Gray kept the other arm round Candace, and there was a warmth and tenderness in the touch which thrilled through Cannie's heart. She felt, without asking why, that Cousin Kate loved her more than usual that night, and it made her happy.  Jane had been deeply aggrieved at the long delay of the dinner; but she was a woman of resources as well as principle, and, as a member in good and regular standing of the Second Baptist Church, knew that forgiveness of injuries was a branch of Christian duty. She reminded herself, beside, that \"Missis wasn't often that inconsiderate, and most probably there was reasons this time,\" which made it easier to overlook her offence. So she kept some things back, and took some things off, and managed to send in the food in an eatable condition, instead of letting it calcine into cinders as a less conscientious and capable cook would have done.  Marian went to bed; but still Mrs. Gray said not a word about Georgie and her confession. She looked weary and preoccupied, and Gertrude fancied--but perhaps it was only fancy--that there was a shade of coldness in her mother's manner towards herself. They were all glad when the time came to separate; but before she slept that night, Mrs. Gray sent a telegram to her husband.  Mr. Gray appeared next day on the earliest possible train. There was a long consultation in the library, in which Georgie took a part. She came out with her eyes red with crying, but somehow looking relieved, too, and with a peaceful look in her face which had been absent from it of late. Candace, passing her on the stairs, averted her eyes shyly, and was altogether astonished at being caught in a tight embrace and kissed several times.  \"It's all right,\" Georgie whispered. \"Papa has been, oh, so kind! and mamma is like an angel to me. You were just right; and I never can thank you enough, you dear!\"  \"Oh, how glad I am!\" cried Cannie, clasping her hands together in sudden relief.  Georgie said no more; she gave Cannie another kiss, and hurried away.  What steps Mr. Gray took to get rid of Alexander, the girls never knew; but whatever they may have been, they were effectual. He disappeared from Newport the very next day, and neither Berry Joy nor Georgie ever saw or heard of him again. It is only on women and girls, and men who are as weak and uninstructed as women, that rascals of his low stamp venture to practise their arts. The moment a man of boldness and resource appears on the scene, one who knows the laws and is not afraid to invoke their protection, black-mailers quail and vanish.  Such an affair cannot, however, be made straight without a good deal of suffering to all concerned. Georgie was forgiven. She was saved from the consequences of her own folly and imprudence; but she could not forgive herself, nor could she forget the deep pain and mortification she had given to the parents she loved, or ignore the fact that she had forfeited something of their good opinion, and that it would take her a long time to regain it. Gertrude, too, had her share to endure. She had a strong sense of honor and a high opinion of her own powers; yet in this the first real test of her life, she had failed miserably, and not only given Georgie no assistance, but had helped to confirm her in her error. Berenice Joy received her portion of punishment in the shape of an interview, which she found most disagreeable, with Mr. Gray. At her urgent entreaty, he gave up his intention of telling the story to her mother, but she felt that she was disgraced in his eyes and in those of Mrs. Gray; and though she cried, and looked very pretty, and was properly grateful and distressed, and assured Mr. Gray that she should never forget how good he had been to her, and that he couldn't imagine how much she and Georgie had suffered just for a moment of thoughtlessness, she was aware all the time that her tears and her gratitude made no impression, and that he did not believe in her. She was sure that all intimacy between herself and Georgie would be discouraged thenceforward; and this was a real punishment, for Berry counted a good deal on the Grays, and had built some social hopes on her position as their friend. Her forebodings proved true. Her little gush of thankfulness and penitence did not touch Mr. Gray's heart in the least. He saw that Berry was a dangerous friend for his soft-hearted, easily influenced Georgie, and told his wife that he decidedly objected to the girls' having anything more to do with her. Mrs. Gray agreed with him in opinion; and though there was no open rupture between the families, Berry found herself after that placed on the footing of an ordinary acquaintance, and was never able to regain her old position with any of the Gray family.  But before this conversation took place it was finally settled that Candace was to stay always, and be Cousin Kate's fourth daughter, and a sister to her three cousins.  Parents, sisters, home,--this was a rich endowment, indeed, for a lonely, orphaned girl to fall heir to. But Cannie had earned her good fortune, and every member of the family had learned to value and to wish to keep her.  It was Mrs. Gray who broke the happy news to her.  \"Shall you like it? Will you be content to stay with us always?\" she asked.  \"Why, Cousin Kate, what a question! How could I help liking it? I never knew what happy meant, till I came to you,\" answered Cannie, flushed with emotion and pleasure. \"It's only that it seems too good to be true! Why, only yesterday I was counting the days till the fifteenth of October; because, you know, you are going back to town then, and I thought you would send me back to Aunt Myra, and I said, 'I shall only be happy for twenty-four days more, perhaps only twenty-three,'--for, you see, I didn't feel sure that you could keep me till the very last day. And now there is going to be no end to the happy times. I can't see what makes you so good to me, Cousin Kate.\"  \"I think we can understand that better than you can,\" her cousin replied. \"We need you, Cannie, as much as you need us. The benefit will be mutual.\"  \"Need _me_! when you have Cousin Court and the girls?\"  \"Cousin Court and the girls need you too.--Don't we, Georgie? Come in and help me explain to Candace that all of us want her, and all of us are glad to have her stay.\"  \"Indeed, we do. Cannie, I can't talk about it, for it's like a bad dream from which I have waked up, and I don't like to recall it; but I never shall forget how good you were to me that horrible day. It was you who persuaded me to go to mamma. I never should have gone if you hadn't somehow swept me up and made me. And, oh, if I hadn't!--How could I be afraid of you, dear, darling mamma?--She was just what you said she would be, Cannie. She knew just what to do; she understood in a moment. She was so kind! I feel as if Trinity Church had been rolled off my mind. It was all your doing, and I never can forget it.\"  \"Georgie is right,\" said Mrs. Gray. \"Don't look so bewildered, dear. You did her a real service in persuading her to be brave and frank. I don't know why it is so hard for children to trust their parents. It is the parents' fault somehow, no doubt.\"  \"Oh, mother, _no_! It was only that I dreaded to have you think ill of me.\"  \"Not quite,\" said Mrs. Gray, shaking her head. \"I must blame myself a little. I must have made some mistake with you all, when even Gertrude could not believe that I would not be harsh and unforgiving. But we have had our lesson, Georgie, and we will not do so badly again, especially as there will be this dear little new sister of yours to help us to keep straight. We need not talk any more about it, but, Cannie, we all feel that to have you with us will be good for us all. There is nothing in the world so rare and so precious as clear truth, and the courage to hold fast by it; and we have proved that you possess both.\"  \"And don't you think that it will be good for me?\" said Cannie, her eyes shining with grateful tears.  \"Yes; we can help you too. It is one of the good things in this world that help is almost always on both sides.--Marian,\" as that small person passed the door, \"what do you think of having Cannie permanently for a sister?\"  \"Really! Will she stay? Oh, how perfectly--daisy!\" And Marian threw her arms round Candace's neck, and gave her a squeeze which left no doubt as to her approval of the plan.  Only one cloud now remained on Candace's horizon of happiness. Mrs. Gray had become like a very mother to her. Her bright, perpetual, all-understanding tenderness was like daily food to Candace's hungering heart. Mr. Gray had taken her into the highest favor. He had always liked Cannie and been kind to her, but now he petted her almost as much as he petted Marian. He scarcely ever came back from New York without bringing her some little gift,--a book, a trinket, a box of bonbons,--as a proof that she had been in his thoughts. The latest and prettiest of these was on her finger now,--a pearl ring with the word \"Truth\" engraved inside its golden circlet. Georgie and Marian had welcomed her heartily; but Gertrude,--Gertrude had said nothing. She was always cordial now, and a sort of added respect and liking had appeared in her manner since the Alexander episode; but about the new arrangement which made Candace one of the family, she had not spoken a word. Till she did, till she was sure that Gertrude too was content to have her stay, Cannie's happiness could not be complete.  The fourteenth of October at length arrived. It was the last day of their Newport season, but Candace no longer dreaded the break-up. It did not mean separation and loneliness now, only the change to a new and different scene, which might be as delightful in its way as the summer had been. Yet Newport was still in full beauty, and it seemed a pity to leave it. No frosts had fallen to dim the glory of the flowers. The honeysuckles were still starred with their white, gold-anthered blossoms; the geranium beds looked as gay, the foliage plants as superb as ever; while the green of the grass was as fresh as in July. Here and there a little drift of yellow leaves lay under the trees, but it was the only sign of autumn. Georgie gathered a great basketful of nasturtiums, heliotrope, and mignonette to carry down to Miss Gisborne, and Marian was sent off in the village-cart with a similar basketful for Mrs. Frewen. The house was all in a confusion of packing. Frederic was wrapping tissue-paper round the picture-frames, Elizabeth counting linen and silver, the gardeners emptying the balcony boxes. Mrs. Gray proposed that Gertrude and Candace should go for a last walk on the Cliffs, and so be out of the way of these discomforts.  \"There is nothing for you to do,\" she said. \"Only don't stay too late, and come in before it grows dark. We are to have a 'thick tea' at half-past six, in place of a regular dinner. I thought it would be less trouble on this busy day.\"  It was to Pulpit Rock that the two cousins bent their way. The Cliffs were even lonelier now than they had been when Candace first visited them. There were no bathers in the surf; no carriages were drawn up on the higher part of the beach, and the road leading around Easton's Point showed only a few scattered figures and one solitary horseman on its entire length. Here and there along the windings of the Cliff Walk a single walker appeared, dark against the brightness of the sky, or two girls were seen pacing the smooth gravel, with fluttering dresses, and hair blown by the soft October wind. The sea was as beautiful in color as ever, but it had changed with the change of the season. The blue seemed more rarefied, the opalescent tints more intense; deep purple reflections lay in the shadows made by the rocky points, and there was a bright clearness of atmosphere quite unlike the dream-like mistiness of the summer.  The cousins sat side by side on the big rock, just where they had sat on that June day which seemed to Candace so long ago. Gertrude was no longer critical or scornful. She sat a little farther back than Candace, and from time to time glanced at her side-face with a sort of puzzled expression. Cannie, happening to turn, caught the look; it embarrassed her a little, and to hide the embarrassment she began to talk.  \"Did you know that Cousin Kate is going to let me live with you always?\" she asked.  \"Yes; mamma told me.\"  \"Isn't she good?\" went on Candace, impulsively. \"I can hardly believe yet that it is true. What makes you all so very, very kind to me, I can't think.\"  \"I haven't been particularly kind,\" said Gertrude, suddenly. \"Candace,--I might as well say it at once, for it's been a good deal on my mind lately,--I wish you would forget how nasty I was when you first came to us.\"  \"Were you nasty?\" said Candace, trying to speak lightly, but with a flush creeping into her face.  [Illustration: THE CLIFFS.  \"I shall always love this rock,\" said Candace.--PAGE 281.]  \"Yes, I was; very nasty. I didn't care to have you come, in the first place; and I thought you seemed awkward and countrified, and I didn't like your clothes, and I was afraid the girls here would laugh at you. It was a mean sort of feeling, and the worst thing is that I didn't see that it was mean. I was ashamed of you; but now I am ashamed, dreadfully ashamed, of myself. I felt so much wiser and more knowing than you then; and yet when Georgie, my own sister, got into this dreadful trouble and came to me for help, I had none to give her. I was as much a coward as she was. I gave her bad advice; and it was you, whom I laughed at and was unkind to, who saw what she ought to do, and was brave and really helped. When I think of it all, I feel as if I couldn't forgive myself.\"  \"Why, Gertrude dear, don't!\" cried Cannie; for Gertrude was almost crying. \"I don't wonder you didn't care for me at first. I was dreadfully awkward and stupid. And you never were nasty to me. Don't say such things! But\"--with a shy longing to remove beyond question the doubt which had troubled her--\"you _do_ like me now? You are not sorry that I am to stay and live with you?\"  \"Sorry! No; I am very, very glad. You are the best girl I know. It will do me heaps of good to have you in the house.\"  \"Oh, how delightful!\" cried Cannie. \"Now I haven't a thing to wish for. It is all nonsense about my doing you good, but I am so glad you want me to stay.\"  The two girls nestled closer and kissed each other, with a new sense of friendship and liking. The west wind blew past, making little quick eddies on the surface of the water. The gulls flew lower, their white wings flashing close to the flashing surf; sails far out at sea gleamed golden in the level rays of the sunset; a yellow light enveloped the farther point.  \"I shall always love this rock,\" said Candace.  Gertrude began the downward climb; but Candace paused a moment on the summit, and turned for a last look at the water. Every glittering foam-cap, every glinting sail, seemed to her to wave a signal of glad sympathy and congratulation. \"Good-by,\" she softly whispered. \"But I shall come back. You belong to me now.\" She kissed her hand to the far blue horizon; then with a smile on her face, she turned, and followed Gertrude down the steep rock-face, a happy girl.\n\n"

I SUPPOSE that most boys and girls who go to school and study geography know, by sight at least, the little patch of pale pink which is marked on the map as \"Switzerland.\" I suppose, too, that if I asked, \"What can you tell me about Switzerland?\" a great many of them would cry out, \"It is a mountainous country, the Alps are there, Mont Blanc is there, the highest land in Europe.\" All this is true; but I wonder if all of those who know even so much have any idea what a beautiful country Switzerland is? Not only are the mountains very high and very grand, but the valleys which lie between are as green as emerald, and full of all sorts of wild flowers; there are lakes of the loveliest blue, rivers which foam and dash as merrily as rivers do in America, and the prettiest farmhouses in the world,--_chlets_ the Swiss call them,--with steep roofs and hanging balconies, and mottoes and quaint ornaments carved all over their fronts. And the most peculiar and marvellous thing of all is the strange nearness of the grass and herbage to the snows. High, high up in the foldings of the great mountains on whose tops winter sits all the year long, are lovely little valleys hidden away, where goats and sheep feed by the side of glacier-fed streams; and the air is full of the tinkle of their bells, and of the sweet smells of the mountain flowers. The water of these streams has an odd color which no other waters have,--a sort of milky blue-green, like an opal. Even on the hottest days a chilly air plays over their surface, the breath, as it were, of the great ice-fields above, from whose melting snows the streams are fed. And the higher you climb, still greener grow the pastures and thicker the blossoms, while the milk in the _chlet_ pans seems half cream, it is so rich. Delicious milk it is, ice cold, and fragrant as if the animals which produce it had fed on flowers. Oh, Switzerland is a wonderful land indeed!  One day as I sat in a thicket of Alp roses in one of those lovely, lonely upper valleys, I happened to raise my eyes, and noticed, high in the cliff above, a tall narrow rock as white as snow, which looked exactly like a door set in the face of the gray precipice. An old shepherd came by, and I asked him about it. He said it was called \"The Door,\" and that the valley was called \"The Valley of the Door\" by some folks because of it, but that its real name was \"_Das Fritzethal_,\" or \"Fritz's Valley,\" on account of a boy called Fritz who once lived there. I wanted to know about the boy, and as the old man had a little time to spare, he sat down beside me and told this story, which I will now tell you.  \"It was many, many years ago,\" the shepherd said, \"so many that no man now remembers exactly when it happened. Fritz's mother was a widow, and he was her only child. They were poor people, and had to work hard for a living. Fritz was a steady, faithful lad, and did his best. All day long he dug and toiled, and herded and milked and fed his goats; in the winter he carved wooden bowls for sale in the lower valley; but, work as he would, it was not always easy to keep the meal-bin full. What made it harder, were the strange storms which every few months swept the valley and damaged the crops. Out of the blue sky, as it were, these storms would suddenly drop. The sun would be shining one moment; the next, great torrents of rain would begin to fall and fierce winds to blow, flooding the crops and carrying drifts of sand and gravel across the fields. Then, at other times, no rain would fall for months together, and every green thing would be burned and dried up, while perhaps at the very same time the lower valleys had plenty of rain. This happened so often that people gave the Thal the name of \"The Unlucky Valley,\" and it was accounted a sad thing to have to get a living there. The climate is very different now--praised be God.  \"You can see, madame, that Fritz's lot was not strewn with roses. Still he was a brave lad, and did not lose heart. He had no play-fellows, but sometimes in the long summer days when he sat to watch the herd, he would tell himself stories by way of amusement, and almost always these stories were about the White Door up there, which was as much a marvel then as now. At last, by dint of looking and dreaming, it grew to be so like a real door to him, that he resolved one day to climb up and see it closer.\"  \"Up there!\" I cried with horror.  \"Yes, madame. It was very rash. Any ordinary boy would have been dashed to pieces, but Fritz was wiry, strong, and active as a mountain goat. There are no such boys left nowadays. One night, while his mother slept, he stole away, climbed as high as he dared by moonlight, took a wink of sleep under a shelving rock, and with the first dawn began to make his way upward, testing every foothold, and moving cautiously; for though he loved adventure, Fritz was by no means a foolhardy boy, and had no mind to lose his life if wit and care could keep it safe. But the climb was a terrible one. He had been on precipices before, but never on such as this. Only God's goodness saved him again and again. A hundred times he wished himself back, but to return was worse than to go on. So up and up he went, and at last, scaling that sheer brown cliff which you see there, and throwing himself breathless on a narrow ledge, he found himself close to the object of his desires. There, just before him, was the Little White Door.  [Illustration: Pretty soon he grew bold, and seizing the knocker he gave a loud rap.  PAGE 15.]  \"The sight restored his energies at once. It was a real door--that he saw at a glance, for there was a latch and a keyhole and a knocker--all carved of white stone, and on the door a name in good German characters, '_Die Wolken_.' I do not know the name in English.\"  \"It is 'Clouds,'\" I told him.  \"Ah, yes, 'die clouds.' Fritz could hardly believe his eyes, as you may imagine.  \"Pretty soon he grew bold, and seizing the knocker he gave a loud rap. Nobody answered at first, so he rapped again, louder and louder, until the sound echoed from the rocks like thunder. At last the door opened very suddenly, and some one drew Fritz in and shut the door again quickly. All was dark inside, but he felt a cool touch on his wrist, and a hand he could not see led him along a rocky passage into the heart of the cliff.  \"After a while a glimmering light appeared, and the passage turned suddenly into a large hall, which was full of people, Fritz thought at first; but then he saw that they were not people, but strange rounded shapes in white or gray, who moved and bounded, and seemed to be playing a game of some sort. It was like a game of bowls, but the things they rolled to and fro on the rocky floor were not balls, but shapes like themselves, only smaller and rounder, and of all beautiful colors, red and purple and yellow. The creatures liked to roll, it would seem, for they skipped and jumped as they went along, and laughed with a sort of crackling laughter, which echoed oddly back from the roof of the cave. The big shapes laughed too in great booming tones. Altogether they made a great deal of noise. Still the damp little hand clasped Fritz's wrist, and looking down he saw that his guide was no other than one of those same small shapes which were the balls of the game. There was something so familiar in the pink-cheeked fleecy outline, that in his surprise Fritz forgot to be afraid, and spoke aloud, crying, 'Why! It's a cloud!'  \"'To be sure. What did you suppose me to be, and why did you come to the clouds' house if you didn't want to see clouds?' replied the thing.  \"'Didn't you see our name on the door? Or perhaps you can't read, Stupid!' demanded a large white cloud, leaving the group of players and coming up to Fritz and his companion.  \"'Yes, I can read, and I did see the name,' stammered Fritz; 'still I didn't--'  \"'You did and you didn't; how intelligent you seem to be!' said the white cloud, with a toss and curl; while a big black thunder-cloud, pitching a little yellow one clear across the cave, shouted in sullen tones which echoed frightfully from the rocks overhead, 'What's that boy doing here spoiling our game? Cumulus, it's your roll. Turn that little beggar out. He has no business here, interfering with the sports of his betters!'  \"Fritz trembled, but his small conductor faced the black cloud undauntedly.  \"'Hold your tongue!' he said. 'This boy is my visitor. I let him in, and you're not to bully him. I won't permit it.'  \"'_You_, indeed!' blustered the thunder-cloud. 'Pray, what can you do about it, Little Pink? I shall say what I like, and do as I like.'  \"'No, you won't,' cried all the small clouds together, rearing themselves up from the floor. 'We fair-weather clouds are not a bit afraid of you, as you know. We know very well how to drive you black ones away, and we will do it now if you are not civil.' Their voices though bright were threatening, and one little violet bit made a dash straight at the nose of the thunder-cloud, who shrank into a corner, muttering wrathfully.  \"'Don't be at all afraid,' said Little Pink to Fritz, in a patronizing tone. 'He shan't do you any harm. That sort of cloud is always afraid to face us, because we are so many, you see, and can serve him as he deserves. Well, now, and what brought you up here, pray?'  \"'I didn't know who lived here, and I wanted so much to see,' replied Fritz, shyly.  \"'You didn't? Didn't you know that this was our house?' demanded the little cloud, astonished.  \"'No, indeed. I didn't even know that you had a house.'  \"'What! Not know that? Pray, where did you suppose we were when you didn't see us in the sky?' cried Little Pink. 'A house! Of course we have a house. Everybody has one. You've got a house yourself, haven't you? Why, we've lived here always, all we clouds. Sometimes we have great family meetings, when we get together and indulge in all sorts of fun and frolic, never going out doors for weeks at a time.'  \"'Oh, those must be the times when our fields all burn up, and the streams run dry, and the poor cattle low with thirst!' said Fritz, suddenly enlightened. 'So you are enjoying yourselves up here all the time, are you? I call that very unkind, and--' Suddenly recollecting where he was, he hung his head, abashed at his own daring.  \"Little Pink hung his head too, with a grieved face.  \"'I never thought of that before,' he said penitently. 'It was pleasant for us, and the time went fast. I recollect now that the world has looked rather queer and yellow sometimes when we have come out again after a long absence, but it grew green presently, and I did not suppose any one minded--'  \"All this while a strange growling sound had been going on in a room opening from the hall, across whose entrance stout bars were fixed.  \"'What _is_ that?' asked Fritz, unable longer to restrain his curiosity.  \"'That? That's only the North Wind,' replied Little Pink, in an absent tone. 'We've shut him up, because he has no business to be abroad in the summer; and he's such a restless creature, and so violent, that he will break loose if he can, and do all manner of mischief. Last year, about this time, he got out and raised a great storm, and made a fearful mess of it down below.'  \"'I recollect. That was the storm that killed three of our sheep, and ruined the barley crop,' exclaimed Fritz. 'Oh, it was dreadful! We had to make half a loaf do the work of a whole one all winter long in consequence. It was hungry times in the valley, I can tell you. Oh, the evil Wind!'  \"'You poor fellow!' cried the little cloud. 'Well, he's safe now, as you see. He can't get out and plague you this year, at least. But I'm so sorry you went hungry. It wasn't our fault, really it wasn't; still I should like to make it up to you somehow, if I could.' He reflected a moment, then he went forward and gave a call which collected all the other clouds around him. Fritz watched them consulting together; at last they moved toward him in a body.  \"'Now, Boy,' said Little Pink, who seemed to have elected himself spokesman, 'because you're a good boy and have had bad luck, and because you're the first boy who ever came up here and rapped on our door, we're going to propose a bargain. So long as you live in the valley below and are steady, and work hard and keep a kind heart in your bosom for people not so well off as yourself, so long we will look after your farm and befriend it. Water shall fall on it regularly, flood and tempest shall spare it, the grass shall never dry, nor the brook fail, nor the herds lack for food. We shall watch closely, and so long as you keep your word we will keep ours. Do you agree?'  \"'What! never any more droughts, never any floods,' cried Fritz, unable to believe such good news. 'Oh, how happy mother will be! Indeed, indeed I will do my best--pray believe that I will.'  \"'The proof of the pudding,' began Cumulus, but Little Pink silenced him with a wave of his hand.  \"'Very well, you do your best and we will do ours,' he said in a cheery tone. 'Now about getting you home. Do you know how late it is?'  \"'No,' said Fritz, who had forgotten all about time.  \"'It is just noon.'  \"'Really? Oh, how frightened the mother will be!' cried Fritz, his heart sinking as he thought of the terrible cliffs which he must descend.  \"'He never can go home as he came,' declared a rainbow, craning its long curved neck like a giraffe's over the heads of the others.  \"'I'll tell you, let us all carry him down on our shoulders,' suggested Little Pink.  \"'So we will,' shouted the clouds in a chorus; and jostling and laughing they all crowded into the narrow passage, bearing Fritz in their midst. As the door swung open, in swept fresh visitors, a crowd of tiny scurrying shapes, and some one behind, whipping them along with a lash of many-colored air.  \"'Why, where are you all going?' demanded the new-comer, in a breezy voice. 'I've collected these stray lambs from hither and yon, and now I'm in for the day. What takes you out, pray?'  \"'We'll not be gone a minute. We're only going to carry this boy home,' answered the rest; while Little Pink whispered in Fritz's ear, 'That's the West Wind. He's a great favorite with us all.'  \"'Hallo! A boy! Why, so it is,' cried West Wind. He pounced on Fritz as he spoke, kissed him, ruffled his hair, boxed his ears softly, all in a minute. Then, with a gay, whooping laugh he vanished into the passage, while the clouds, raising Fritz, floated downward like a flock of white-winged birds. Little Pink lay under his cheek like a pillow. Softly as thistle-down touches earth they landed on the valley floor, laid Fritz on a bed of soft grass, and rose again, leaving him there. He looked up to watch them rise, bright and smiling. Little Pink waved a rosy hand. Higher and higher sailed the clouds, then they vanished into the door, and the door was shut.\"  I am telling the story, as you see, rather in my own words than in those of the old shepherd, but you won't mind that. The truth is, I cannot remember the exact language he used, but so long as I keep to the main points of the history it doesn't much matter, does it?  \"In a few minutes Fritz recovered his wits and made haste home, for he feared his mother might be alarmed at his long absence. She was not, however, for she supposed that he had risen early, as he sometimes did, and taking a piece of bread in his hand, had followed the goats up the valley, breakfasting by the way. She met him, full of wonder at a strange thing that had happened.  \"'Such a queer mist filled the valley just now,' she said, 'I could not see the sun at all. I feared a storm was coming, but presently it rolled away all in a minute, and left the day as fine as ever. Did you notice it? I never saw anything like it before.'  \"Fritz let his mother wonder, and held his peace. She would think that he had fallen asleep and dreamed it all, he was sure; in fact, after a little he himself began to believe that it was a dream.  \"But, dream or no dream, the strange thing was that it came true! From that time on, the climate of the Unlucky Valley seemed to change. Years passed by without a single drought or inundation. When the pastures below were parched with thirst, rain fell on Fritz's fields, keeping them green as emerald. All his crops succeeded; his goats and sheep gave double share of milk, and little by little he grew rich.  \"'The Lucky Valley,' people now called the once unlucky spot, while to Fritz they gave the name of 'The Favored of the Saints.' Year after year his gains went on increasing. Gradually all the land in the valley became his, except one tiny strip, there at the upper end, which belonged to a widow, poor as Fritz's mother once had been. This strip Fritz desired to buy, but the widow refused to sell, though he offered a large price. She had come there a bride, she declared, with the myrtle-crown on her head, and there she wished to die and be buried when her time should come. The memory of his own poor mother, who had died some time before, should have made Fritz pitiful to this lonely woman, but his heart had grown hard with continued prosperity, and it angered him to be opposed. So when after many attempts she persisted in her resolution, he tried harsher means. The widow had debts. These he bought up, and when she could not pay he brought the pressure of the law to bear, and turned her from her home.  \"The very night after he had watched her depart, weeping and broken-hearted, as he lay on his bed, feeling at last that the valley was all his own, the Little White Door opened on the cliffs far above, and out came the clouds.  \"Not pink and purple now, smiling and full of good will, but black and wrathful. Like a flock of dark vultures they swooped at the sleeping valley. Floods of rain fell, fierce winds tore and raved, the river rose and burst its bounds, carrying all before it; and Fritz, awakened by the fearful roar, had just time to escape from his bed and gain the nearer hillside, when the waters struck the _chlet_ and bore it away in ruins down the valley, as though it were no more than a bubble of foam. The crops were swept off, the flocks drowned in the fields. Fritz clung to a tree-trunk through that fearful night, listening to the hiss and rush of the flood, and the bleatings of the drowning sheep; and ever and anon it seemed as if shapes, dimly seen through the darkness, swooped at and buffeted him, while voices cried in his ear, 'Promise-breaker! Widow-spoiler! Is _this_ the way you keep faith with the clouds?'  \"When morning dawned it revealed a scene of ruin. Not a blade of barley remained in the meadows, not a blade of grass in the fields. The labor of years had vanished in a single night.\"  \"It served him right,\" said I.  \"Ah, my lady,\" replied the old shepherd, \"God is more merciful to sinners than we men can be. Fritz was not wicked at heart. He saw his fault now in the light of his misfortune, and was sorry for it. Gladly would he have made amends, but he was now poor as the poorest, for the waters lay over the earth, and did not run off as waters generally do. The fertile valley was become a lake, into which points of land, fringed with broken and battered trees, pushed themselves. It was a sad sight.  \"News of the disaster reached the lower valleys, and the kindly peasants flocked to help. But what could they do till the water receded? Nothing. They could only say comforting words and return to their homes, leaving Fritz to his fate.  \"He waited many days, then he formed a bold resolution. He determined to climb the cliff once more, knock at the Little White Door, and plead with the clouds for forgiveness.\"  \"That was bold indeed,\" I said.  \"It was a much harder task than it had been years before, when he was a boy and his joints were supple,\" continued the old shepherd. \"Only desperation carried him upward, but at last he did reach the door. He knocked many times without answer, and when at length the door opened, it was not a merry little cloud which appeared, but a tall, gloomy white one, which looked like a sheeted ghost. No game was going on in the great hall. The clouds, dressed in black, each with his thunder-cap on, sat side by side, and frowned on Fritz as he stood in the midst and made his plea.  \"'I have sinned,' he said sadly, as he ended, 'I have sinned grievously, and I am justly punished. I forgot my promise to you, _meine Herren_, and I cannot complain that you broke yours to me. But give me one more chance, I implore you. Let me atone for my fault, and if I fail again, punish me as you will.'  \"It seemed to him that the clouds grew a little less gloomy as he spoke, and their voices were gentle as they replied, 'Very well, we will consider of it. Now go.' There was no offer to carry him this time. Exhausted and weary he groped his way down at peril to life and limb, and more dead than alive crept into the miserable shed which had replaced his home, with no assured hope as to what the clouds might elect to do.  \"But lo, in the morning the waters had begun to fall. He hardly dared believe his eyes, but day by day they slowly grew less. By the end of a fortnight the ground was left bare. Such land! Rough, seamed, gullied by the flood, covered with slime from the mountain side and with rocks and gravel,--it seemed a hopeless task to reclaim it again into pasture.  \"But Fritz was a strong man and his will was good. Little by little the rocks were removed, the fields resown, and the valley restored to its old fruitfulness. The soil seemed richer than ever before, as if the mud and slime which had lain so long on the surface were possessed of some fertilizing quality. Another _chlet_ in time arose, in place of the old one. By the end of fifteen years Fritz again was a rich man, richer than before. But his hard heart had been drowned in the flood, and the new heart which he brought back from the Little White Door was soft and kind. As soon as he could, he sought out the poor widow and restored to her all she had lost, land and home and goats. Later on he wedded her niece, a good and honest maiden, and they took the widow to live under their own roof, and were to her as a son and daughter. So the last years of Fritz were his best years, and his name, 'The Favored of the Saints,' stuck to him for the rest of his life. And it is from him that this valley is named _Das Fritzethal_, my lady.\"  \"And is the story really a true one?\" I asked.  \"Ah, who knows?\" said the old shepherd, shaking his head wisely. \"The world has so many liars in it that no one can be sure.\" Then he took off his odd pointed hat, made a bow, called to his goats, and went his way down the valley, followed by the herd with their many-keyed tinkling bells.  I looked up. The Little White Door shone out of the face of the cliff all rosy pink with sunset. It was time for me to go also.  \"At least,\" I thought, \"if the story is not all true, if it has changed and grown a little during the course of the years,--at least it is a good story, and I am glad I heard it.\"     LITTLE KAREN AND HER BABY.   THE cottage in which little Karen lived stood high up on the hillside, close to the edge of a great forest. It was a strange, lonely place for a young wife, almost a girl, to be so happy in; but Karen was not afraid of the forest, and never thought her home lonely, not even when the strong winds blew in winter-time, and brought the far-off baying of wolves from the mountains beyond. Her husband, her boy, her housewifely cares, her spinning-wheel, and her needle kept her busy all day long, and she was as cheerful as busy. The cottage was not large, but it was strongly built of heavy beams and stones. Its low walls seemed to hug and clasp the ground, as if for protection in time of storm. The casement windows, with their very small panes of thick glass, let in little sun, but all summer long they stood open, and in winter, what with the crackling fire, the hum of the wheel, and Karen's bright face, the living-room never looked dark, and, for all its plainness, had an air of quaint comfort about it. Fritz, Karen's husband, who was skilful with tools, had ornamented the high-backed chair, the press for clothes, and the baby's oaken cradle, with beautiful carving, of which little Karen was exceedingly proud. She loved her cottage, she loved the great wood close by; her lonely life was delightful to her, and she had not the least wish to exchange it for the toy-like village in the valley below.  But Karen was unlike other people, the neighbors said, and the old gossips were wont to shake their heads, and mutter that there was a reason for this unlikeness, and that all good Christians ought to pity and pray for the poor child.  Long, long ago, said these gossips,--so long that nobody now could remember exactly when it was,--Karen's great-great-great-grandfather, (or perhaps _his_ grandfather--who could tell?) when hunting in the high mountains, met a beautiful, tiny maiden, so small and light that a man could easily carry her in the palm of one hand. This maiden he fell in love with, and he won her to be his wife. She made a good wife; kept the house as bright as new tin; and on her wheel spun linen thread so fine that mortal eye could hardly see it. But a year and a day from the time of her marriage she went out to walk in the wood, and never came back any more! The reason of this was, that she was a gnomide,--daughter of one of the forest gnomes,--and when her own people encountered her thus alone, they detained her, and would not suffer her to return to her husband. The baby she left in the cradle grew to be a woman,--bigger than her gnome mother, it is true, but still very small; and all the women of the race have been small since that time. Witness little Karen herself, whose head only came up to the shoulder of her tall Fritz. Then her passion for woods and solitary places, her beautiful swift spinning, her hair, of that peculiar pale white-brown shade,--all these were proofs of the drops of unearthly blood which ran in her veins. Gnomes always had white hair. This was because they lived in holes and dark places. Even a potato would throw out white leaves if kept in a cellar,--everybody knew that,--and the gossips, ending thus, would shake their heads again, and look very wise.  Karen had heard these stories, and laughed at them. No fairy or gnome had ever met her eyes in the woods she loved so well; and as for hair, Rosel Pilaff's, and Gretchen Erl's too, was almost as pale as hers. Fair hair is common enough in the German mountains. Her little boy--bless him!--had downy rings which promised to become auburn in time, the color of his father's beard. She did not believe in the gnome story a bit.  But there came a time when she almost wished to believe it, for the gnomes are said to be wise folk, and little Fritz fell ill of a strange disease, which neither motherly wisdom nor motherly nursing was able to reach. Each day left him thinner and weaker, till he seemed no more than half his former size. His very face looked strange as it lay on the cradle-pillow, and Karen was at her wits' end to know what to do.  \"I will go to the village and ask Mother Klaus to come and see the child,\" said Fritz. \"She may know of a remedy.\"  \"It will be of no use,\" declared Karen, sadly. \"She went to the Berards' and the baby died, and to Heinrich's and little Marie died. But go, go, Fritz!--only come back soon, lest our angel take flight while you are away!\"  She almost pushed him from the door, in her impatience to have him return.  A while after, when the baby had wailed himself to sleep, she went again to the door to look down the path into the valley. It was too soon to hope for Fritz, but the movement seemed a relief to her restlessness. It was dusk, not dark,--a sweet, mild dusk, with light enough left to show the tree-branches as they met and waved against the dim yellow sky. Deep shadows lay on the moss-beds and autumn flowers which grew beneath; only a faint perfume here and there told of their presence, and the night was very near.  Too unhappy to mind the duskiness, Karen wandered a little way up the wood-path, and sat down on the root of an old oak, so old that the rangers had given it the name of \"Herr Grandfather.\" It was only to clear her brimming eyes that she sat down. She wiped them with her kerchief, and, with one low sob, was about to rise, when she became aware that somebody was standing at her side.  This somebody was a tiny old woman, with a pale, shadowy, but sweet face, framed in flossy white hair. She wore a dark, foreign-looking robe; a pointed hood, edged with fur, was pulled over her head; and the hand which she held out as she spoke was as white as the stalk of celery.  \"What is the matter, my child?\" she asked, in a thin, rustling voice, which yet sounded pleasantly, because it was kind.  \"My baby is _so_ ill,\" replied Karen, weeping.  \"How ill?\" inquired the old woman, anxiously. \"Is it cold? Is it fever? Do its eyes water? My baby once had a cold, and her eyes--\" She stopped abruptly.  \"His eyes do not water,\" said Karen, who felt singularly at home with the stranger. \"But his head is hot, and his hands; he sleeps ill, and for these ten days has hardly eaten. He grows thinner and whiter every hour, and wails whenever he is awake. Oh, what am I doing? I must go back to him.\" And, as she spoke, she jumped from her seat.  \"One minute!\" entreated the little old woman. \"Has he pain anywhere?\"  \"He cries when I move his head,\" said Karen, hurrying on.  The stranger went too, keeping close beside her in a swift, soundless way.  \"Take courage, Liebchen, child to her who was child of my child's child,\" she said. \"Weep not, my darling. I will send you help. Out of the wisdom of the earth shall come aid for the little dear one.\"  \"What _do_ you mean?\" cried Karen, stopping short in her surprise.  But the old woman did not answer. She had vanished. Had the wind blown her away?  \"How could I wander so far? How could I leave my baby? Wicked mother that I am!\" exclaimed Karen, in sudden terror, as she ran into the cottage.  But nothing seemed disturbed, and no one had been there. The baby lay quietly in his cradle, and the room was quite still, save for the hiss of the boiling pot and the fall of an ember on the hearth. Gradually her heart ceased its terrified beating; a sense of warmth and calm crept over her, her eyes drooped, and, seated at the cradle-foot, she fell asleep in her chair.  Whether it was an hour or a minute that she slept, she never knew. Slowly and dimly her waking senses crept back to her; but though she heard and saw and understood, she could neither stir nor speak. Two forms were bending over the cradle, forms of little men, venerable and shadowy, with hair like snow, and blanched, pale hands, like her visitor of the afternoon. They did not look at Karen, but consulted together above the sleeping child.  \"It is _here_, brother, and _here_,\" said one, laying his finger gently on the baby's head and heart.  \"Does it lie too deep for our reaching?\" asked the second, anxiously.  \"No. The little herb you know of is powerful.\"  \"And the crystal dust _you_ know of is more powerful still.\"  Then they took out two minute caskets, and Karen saw them open the baby's lips, and each drop in a pinch of some unknown substance.  \"He is of ours,\" whispered one, \"more of ours than any of them have been since the first.\"  \"He has the gift of the far sight,\" said the other, lightly touching the closed eyes, \"the divining glance, and the lucky finger.\"  \"I read in him the apprehension of metals,\" said the second old man, \"the sense of hidden treasures, the desire to penetrate.\"  \"We will teach him how the waters run, and what the birds say--yes, and the way in and the way out!\"  \"Put the charm round his neck, brother.\"  Then Karen saw the little men tie a bright object round the baby's neck. She longed to move, but still she sat mute and powerless, while the odd figures passed round the cradle, slowly at first, then faster and faster, crooning, as they went, a song which was like wind in branches, and of which this scrap lodged in her memory:--            \"Eyes to pierce the darkness through,            Wit to grasp the hidden clew,            Heart to feel and hand to do,--            These the gnomes have given to you.\"  So the song and the circling movement went on, faster and more fast, and round and round, till Karen's head swam and her senses seemed to spin in a whirling dance; and she knew no more till roused by the opening of the door, and Fritz's voice exclaiming: \"Come in, Dame Klaus--come in! Karen! Where are you, wife? Ah, here she is, fast asleep, and the little man is asleep too.\"  \"I am not asleep,\" said Karen, finding her voice with an effort. Then, to her husband's surprise, she began to weep bitterly. But, for all his urgings, she would not tell the cause, for she was afraid of Dame Klaus's tongue.  The dame shook her head over the sick baby. He was very bad, she said; still, she had brought through others as bad as he, and there was no telling. She asked for a saucepan, and began to brew a tea of herbs, while Karen, drawing her husband aside, told her wonderful tale in a whisper.  \"Thou wert dreaming, Karen; it is nothing but a dream,\" declared the astounded Fritz.  \"No, no,\" protested Karen. \"It was not a dream. Baby will be well again, and great things are to happen! You will see! The little men know!\"  \"Little men! Oh, Karen! Karen!\" exclaimed Fritz.  But he said no more, for Karen, bending over the cradle, lifted the strange silver coin which was tied round the baby's neck, and held it up to him with a smile. A silver piece is not a dream, as every one knows; so Fritz, though incredulous, held his tongue, and neither he nor Karen said a word of the matter to Mother Klaus.  Baby _was_ better next day. It was all the herb-tea, Mother Klaus declared, and she gained great credit for the cure.  This happened years ago. Little Fritz grew to be a fine man, sound and hearty, though never as tall as his father. He was a lucky lad too, the villagers said, for his early taste for minerals caught the attention of a rich gentleman, who sent him to the school of mines, where he got great learning. Often when the mother sat alone at her wheel, a smile came to her lips, and she hummed low to herself the song of the little old men:--            \"Eyes to pierce the darkness through,            Wit to grasp the hidden clew,            Heart to feel and hand to do,--            These the gnomes have given to you.\"     HELEN'S THANKSGIVING.   \"MAMMA, would you mind _very_ much if I should learn to make pies?\"  This request sounds harmless, but Mrs. Sands quite started in her chair as she heard it. She and Helen were sitting on either side of a wood-fire. The blinds had been pulled down to exclude the chill November darkness, and the room was lit only by the blazing logs, which sent out quick, bright flashes followed by sudden soft shadows, in that unexpected way which is one of the charms of wood-fires. It was a pretty room, in a pretty house, in one of the up-town streets of New York, and the mother and daughter looked very comfortable as they sat there together.  \"Pies, my dear? What _do_ you mean?\"  \"I'll tell you, mamma. You're going to Grandmamma Ellis for Thanksgiving, this year, you know, and papa and I are going up to Vermont, to Grandmother Sands?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, I don't remember grandmother much, because it is so long since she was here, but the one thing I do recollect is how troubled she was because I didn't know anything about housekeeping. One day you had a headache, and wanted some tea; and you rang and rang, and Jane was ever so long in fetching it, and at last grandma said, 'Why don't you run down and see to it, Helen?' And when I told her that I wasn't allowed to go into the kitchen, and beside that I didn't know how to make tea, she looked so distressed, and said, 'Dear me, dear me! Poor little ignorant girl! What a sad bringing up for you in a country like ours!' I didn't understand exactly what she meant, but I have never forgotten it, and do you know, mamma, just that one speech of grandma's has made me want to do ever so many things. I never told you, but once I made my bed for more than a week,--till Bridget said I was 'worth my salt as a chambermaid,' and I used to dust the nursery, and sweep. And the other day it came into my head suddenly how pleased grandmother would be if I carried her a pumpkin-pie that I had made myself; so I asked Morrison, and she said she'd teach me, and welcome, if you didn't mind. Do you mind, mamma?\"  \"You know, dear, I don't like to have you about with the servants, and I never wanted you to become a drudge at home, as so many American girls are. Then you have your lessons to attend to besides.\"  \"Yes, mamma, I know, but it will only take one morning, and I'll not begin till school closes, if you'd rather not. I really would like to so much, mamsie?\"  Helen's pet name for her mother was coaxingly spoken, and had its effect. Mrs. Sands yielded.  \"Very well, dear; you may, if you like, only I wish you could wear gloves.\"  \"O mamma! nobody makes pies in gloves. But I needn't put my hands in at all, except for rolling the paste, Morrison says so.\"  Mrs. Sands was not so silly a woman as she sounds. Born and bred in the West Indies, the constant talk about servants and housekeeping, that met her ears when she came to New York, a young married woman, so puzzled and annoyed her that she somewhat rashly decided that her child should never know anything about such matters. Morrison, the good old cook, had lived with her since Helen was a baby, and all had gone so smoothly that there had never seemed occasion for interference from anybody. And Helen would have grown up in utter ignorance of all practical matters, had not a chance remark of her thrifty New England grandmother piqued her into the voluntary wish of learning.  It was with a good deal of excitement, and a little sense of victory as well, that Helen went downstairs, a few days later, to take the promised lesson. The kitchen looked very cheerful and neat, and Morrison was all ready with her spice-box, eggs, pie-dishes, and great yellow bowl full of strained pumpkin; likewise a big calico apron to tie over Helen's dress. First they made the crust. It was such good fun pinching the soft bits of lard into the nice, dry-feeling flour, that Helen would willingly have prolonged the operation, but Morrison objected. Pastry didn't like to be fingered, she said; and she made Helen wash her hands, and then mix in the ice-water with a thin-bladed knife, cutting and chopping till all was moistened into a rough sort of dough. Next, she produced the rolling-pin, and showed her how to beat the dough with dexterous strokes, up and down, and cross-ways, till it became a smooth paste, which felt as soft as velvet, and then how to roll it into a smooth sheet, lay on the butter in thin flakes, fold and roll again.  \"Now wrap this towel all round it, and I'll set it into the ice-chest till we want it,\" she said. \"It'll puff the minute it goes into the oven, never fear; I can always tell. You like it,--don't you,--Miss Helen dear?\"  \"Yes, indeed, ever so much. I _hope_ the pies will be good; grandmamma will be so pleased.\"  \"They'll be good,\" pronounced Morrison, confidently. \"Now sift in plenty of sugar, miss.\"  So Helen put in \"plenty\" of sugar, and then, as directed, grated lemon-peel, lemon-juice, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, melted butter, a pinch of salt, beaten eggs, a dash of rose-water, and then a little more sugar, and \"just the least taste of cinnamon,\" till Morrison pronounced the flavor exactly right, and Helen declared that for all she could see, pumpkin-pies were made of anything in the world except pumpkins. Last of all went in a great pour of hot milk; then the pie-dishes were lined, filled, and set in the oven, after being ornamented with all manner of zigzags and curly-queues of paste round their edges; and Helen rushed upstairs to tell her mother that pie-making was \"just lovely,\" and she would like to be a cook always, she thought. By Morrison's advice she wrote the whole process down in a book while it was fresh in her mind, and she was glad afterwards that she had done so, as you will see.  That same afternoon Mrs. Sands went on to Philadelphia, and next morning early Helen and her father started for their journey to Vermont. It was gray, blustering weather, but neither of them cared for that. Papa was in high spirits, and full of fun as a school-boy. Their baggage comprised, besides two valises, a big hamper full of all sorts of nice things for grandmother, game and fruit and groceries, and Helen carried a flat basket in her hand, in which, wrapped in a snowy napkin, reposed one of the precious pies.  \"Bless me, how raw it is! It looks as though it were going to snow,\" said Mr. Sands, as he came in from a walk up and down the platform of one of the little stations at which the train stopped; and five minutes later Helen, with a little scream of surprise, cried out, \"Why, papa, it _is_ snowing!\" Sure enough it was,--in fine snow-flakes, which before long thickened into a heavy fall.  \"It will only be a squall,\" Mr. Sands said; but the conductor shook his head, and remarked that up there so near the mountains there was no calculating on weather. It might stop in half an hour, or it might go on all night: no one could pretend to say beforehand which it would do.  By the time they reached Asham, their stopping-place, the ground was solid white. The wind, too, had risen, and was drifting the snow in all directions. The tavern-keeper at Asham, to whom Mr. Sands went for \"a team,\" advised them to stay all night, but this both Helen and her father agreed was not to be thought of. It was only fourteen miles. Grandmamma was expecting them, and must not be disappointed. So, well wrapped in carriage blankets and buffalo robes, they set out in a light covered rockaway, with a stout horse, their baggage packed in behind them.  Fourteen miles may seem a very short distance or a very long one, according to circumstances. Before they had gone half-way both of them began to think it an extremely long one. The road lay up hill for the greater part of the way. Night was coming on fast, and every moment the drift grew thicker and more confusing. Mr. Sands in his secret heart repented that he had not taken the tavern-keeper's advice, and stayed at Asham. At last the horse, which had halted several times and been urged on again, came to a dead stop. Mr. Sands touched him with the whip, but he would not stir. He jumped up to see what was the matter, and found the poor animal up to his chest in snow. He had wandered from the road a little and plunged into a drift. Mr. Sands tried to turn him toward the road, when, lo, a loud and ominous crack was heard, and Helen gave a scream. One of the shafts had snapped in two.  Matters now looked serious. Mr. Sands undid the harness as fast as possible, for he feared the horse might flounder to release himself, and upset the carriage. Then he climbed into the rockaway again, and stood up to see if he could anywhere see the light of a house. No; a twinkling beam was visible farther up the hill, about a quarter of a mile away.  \"Helen,\" he said, \"I'll have to ask you to sit here quietly for ten minutes or so, while I ride on to a house which I see up there, and get some one to help us. Will you be afraid to be left alone? It's only for a little while.\"  \"N-o; but O papa! must you go? I'm so afraid the horse will kick, or you'll tumble off.\"  \"Never fear,\"--trying to laugh,--\"I really must go, dear; it's our only chance of getting out of this scrape. Promise me to sit perfectly still, and on no account to leave the carriage.\"  It seemed much longer than ten minutes before papa got back, but there he was at last, with another man carrying a lantern, both of them white with snow up to their waists.  \"All right, Helen,\" he cried cheerily. \"Wrap all the blankets round your shoulders; I'm going to set you on the horse, and Mr. Simmons and I--this is Mr. Simmons, my dear--will walk on either side and hold you on; we'll have you up the hill in a trice.\"  Helen did not like it at all. The horse felt dreadfully _alive_ under her, and jerked so, as he plunged up hill through the snow, that she was constantly afraid of tumbling off. It did not last long, however. In five minutes her father had lifted and carried her in, and set her down in a kitchen, where a woman with a candle in her hand stood waiting for them.  \"This is Mrs. Simmons,\" he said. \"She is so kind as to say that she will keep us till to-morrow morning, when perhaps the snow will have stopped, and, at all events, we shall have daylight to find our way with. Mr. Simmons and I are going back now to fetch up the luggage. The rockaway will have to take care of itself till to-morrow, I fancy.\"  Left alone, Helen looked curiously about her. The kitchen was a bare-looking place to her eyes. There was a stove with a fire in it, a rocking-chair covered with faded \"patch,\" some wooden chairs, a table, and a sort of dresser with dishes. A large wheel for spinning wool stood in one of the windows. Everything was clean, but there was an air of poverty, and to Helen it seemed a most dismal place. She could not imagine how people could live and be happy there.  Mrs. Simmons herself looked very ill and tired.  \"I enjoy such poor health,\" she explained to Helen, as she took some plates and bowls down from the dresser. \"I got the ague down to Mill Hollow, where we lived, and we moved up here, hoping to get rid of it. I am some better, but it took me powerful hard yesterday, and I suppose I'll have it bad again to-morrow. Mr. Simmons, he's got behindhand somehow, and it's hard work trying to catch up in these times. What with one thing and another, both of us have felt clean discouraged this fall. Glory, fetch the milk.\"  \"Yes, mother.\" And out of the buttery came a girl of about Helen's age, with a pan in her hands. She had apparently tumbled out of bed to help in the entertainment of the strangers, for her hair was flying loose, and she looked only half dressed; but she had pretty brown eyes and a bright smile.  \"I feel real bad to think I'm out of tea,\" said Mrs. Simmons. \"Father, he was calculating to get some later on, when he'd finished a job of lumber-hauling. And the hens have 'most stopped laying, too; I hain't but four eggs in the house.\"  \"Oh, don't give us the eggs!\" cried Helen; \"you'll want them yourself for Thanksgiving, I'm sure.\"  \"Thanksgiving! Dear me, so it is!\" said Mrs. Simmons. \"I'd forgot all about that. Not that it'd have made much difference, any way. You can't make something out of nothin', and that's about what we've come to.\"  \"I've got a pie,\" cried Helen, with a sudden generous impulse, but feeling a little pang meanwhile, as she recalled her vision of putting the pie into grandmamma's own hands. But where was the pie? She recollected now,--the basket was in her lap when papa lifted her out of the carriage. It must have fallen out, and probably was now buried deep in snow.  A great stamping of boots just then announced the entrance of the two men with the valises and hamper. Mrs. Simmons renewed her apologies about the tea. Hot milk, a little fried pork, two of the eggs, and a loaf of saleratus bread were all she had to offer, but it was very welcome to the hungry travellers. There was some choice tea in grandmother's hamper, but Mr. Sands very rightly judged it better to say nothing about it just then, as it might have seemed that he and Helen were not satisfied with their supper. They ate heartily, and soon after went to bed in two chilly little lofts upstairs, where all the buffalo robes and blankets from the carriage could not _quite_ keep them warm.  Helen lay awake a long time, thinking of her own disappointment and grandmamma's, but more still about the Simmons family. How hard and melancholy their life seemed, struggling with poverty and ague up here among the lonely hills, with no doctor near them, and no neighbors! A great sympathy and pity awoke in her heart. Her first impulse, when she roused next morning, was to hurry to the window. It was still snowing, and the drifts seemed deeper than ever! \"Oh, dear!\" she thought, \"we shall have to stay in this forlorn place another day, I am afraid.\" A more generous thought followed: \"If it seems so hard to me to have to spend one day here, what must it be to live here always?\" And she made up her mind that, if they were forced to stay, she would do all she could to make Thanksgiving a little less forlorn than it seemed likely to be to Mrs. Simmons and Glory.  It did look forlorn downstairs in the bare little kitchen. Mrs. Simmons's chill was coming on. She was up and dragging herself about, but she looked quite unfit to be out of bed. Two little children, a boy and a girl, whom Helen had not seen the night before, clung close to her dress, and followed wherever she moved, hiding their shy faces from the strangers. They got over their shyness gradually as Helen laughed, and coaxed them, and by the time breakfast was over had grown good friends.  \"Now,\" said Helen, gayly, after a last glance at the window, which showed the snow-storm still raging, \"I am going to propose a plan. You shall go to bed, Mrs. Simmons,--I'm sure you ought to be there at this moment,--and Glory and I will wash the dishes, and we will cook the Thanksgiving dinner.\"  \"Oh, dear! there ain't nothing worth cooking,\" sighed poor Mrs. Simmons, but she was too ill to make objections. So Glory, or Glorvina, put the kitchen to rights with Helen's help, and then the two girls sat down to consult over dinner.  \"Could you roast a turkey, do you think?\" asked Helen.  \"There ain't no turkey to be roasted,\" objected Glory.  \"Yes, but could you if there were? Because I think there's one in the hamper, papa, and I know grandmamma would let us have it if she knew.\"  \"Why, of course she would. Use everything in the hamper if you like; grandma would never think of objecting, and there's plenty more to be had where those came from,\" said her father.  So the hamper was unpacked, and the turkey extracted, and a package of tea and another of lump sugar, and a tumbler of currant jelly; and Helen filled a big dish with oranges and white grapes, and the preparations went merrily on. There proved to be half a squash in the cellar, and Glory, wading out in the snow, fetched in a couple more eggs from the barn, so pies were possible. Helen produced her recipe-book.  \"Now I'm going to show you just how to make pies,\" she said; \"I only learned myself day before yesterday.\" And she thought, \"How lucky it is that I did learn, for now I can show Glory, and she'll always know. But wouldn't Morrison open her eyes if she could see me?\"  The spices and lemons came out of the hamper, of course, and the crust had to be made of salt butter and no lard; but the pies turned out very good, for all that, and no one was in the least disposed to find fault with their flavor. Really, the little dinner was a great success. Glory's potatoes were a little underdone, but that was the only failure. The children ate as though they could never be satisfied. Mr. Simmons cheered up and cracked one or two feeble jokes; and even Mrs. Simmons, propped high in bed to survey the festive scene, called out that it \"looked something like,\" and she didn't know when there had been so much laughing going on in their house before.  The clock struck three just as the last nicely washed plate was set away on the dresser. Helen quite jumped at the sound. How short, after all, the day had seemed which promised to be so long and dismal! And just then a bright yellow ray streamed through the window, and, looking out, she saw blue sky.  \"Papa,\" she screamed, \"it has cleared up! I do believe we shall get to grandmamma's to-night, after all!\"  And so they did. Mr. Sands, with Mr. Simmons's assistance, fitted the rockaway on to a pair of old sledge-runners, and, with many warm good-byes from the whole family, they drove off. Just at sunset they reached Morrow Hill, and grandma was so glad to see them, and they so glad to get there, that it was easy to forget all their disappointment and delay. In fact, after a little while Helen convinced herself that the whole thing was rather a piece of good fortune than otherwise.  \"For, don't you see, papa,\" she exclaimed, \"we had all Thanksgiving evening with grandmother, you know, and she had it with us, so we only lost part of our pleasant time? But if it hadn't been for the snow and the breakdown, the poor Simmonses wouldn't have had any Thanksgiving at all--not a bit; so it really was a great deal better, don't you see that it was, papa?\"     AT FIESOLE.   FIESOLE is a quaint old town which perches on a hill-top above the valley of the Arno and the city of Florence. You must not pronounce it as it is spelt, but like this--Fee-es-o-lee. From the Florence streets people catch glimpses of its bell-towers and roofs shining above the olive orchards and vineyards of the hillside. A white road winds upward toward it in long, easy zigzags, and seems to say, \"Come with me and I will show you something pretty.\"  Not long ago there were two girls in Florence to whom, plainly as road could speak, the white road seemed to utter these very words. Pauline and Molly Hale were the names of these girls. It was six months since they had left America with their father and mother, and it seemed much longer, because so much had happened in the time. First, the sea voyage, not pleasant, and yet not exactly unpleasant, because papa got better all the way, and that made mamma happy. Now papa would be quite well at once, they thought. His people (for papa was a clergyman) had sent him away for that purpose. They were not a rich people, but each gave a little, and all together it made enough to carry the pastor and his family across the sea and keep them there one year, with very prudent management. The Hales, therefore, did not travel about as most people do, but went straight to Italy, where they hoped to find that sun and warm air which are an invalid's best medicines.  \"Going straight to Italy\" means, however, a great many pleasant things by the way. Molly was always reminding Maria Matilda, her doll, of the sights she had seen and the superior advantages she enjoyed over the dolls at home.  After this mention of a doll, what will you say when I tell you that Molly was almost thirteen? Most girls of thirteen scorn to play with dolls, but Molly was not of their number. She was childish for her years, and possessed a faithful little heart, which clung to Maria Matilda as to an old friend whom it would be unkind to lay aside.  \"First, there was Paris,\" Molly would say to her. \"No, first there was _Deep_, where the people all talked so queerly that we couldn't understand a word. That was funny, Matilda, wasn't it? Then, don't you recollect that beautiful church which we saw when we went past _Ruin_?\" (Molly meant Rouen, but I am sorry to say her pronunciation of French names was rather queer.) \"And Paris too, where I took you to walk in the gardens, and papa let us both ride in a whirligig. None of the home dollies have ever ridden in whirligigs, have they? They won't understand what you mean unless I draw them a picture on my slate. Then we got into the cars, and went and went till we came to that great dark tunnel. Weren't we frightened? And you cried, Matilda--I heard you. You needn't look so ashamed, though, for it _was_ horrid. But we got out of it at last, though I thought we never should; and here we are at the padrona's, and it's ever so nice, only I wish papa would come back.\"  For Florence had proved too cold, and papa had joined a party and gone off to Egypt, leaving mamma and the children to live quietly and cheaply at Signora Goldi's boarding-house. It was a dingy house in the old part of Florence, but for all that it was a very interesting place to live in. The street in which the house stood was extremely narrow. High buildings on either side shut out the sun, the cobblestone pavement was always dirty, but all day long a stream of people poured through it wearing all sorts of curious clothes, talking all sorts of languages, and selling all sorts of things. Men with orange-baskets on their heads strolled along, crying, \"Oranges, sweet oranges!\" Others, with panniers of flowers, chanted, \"Fiori, belli fiori!\" Pedlers displayed their wares or waved gay stuffs; boys held up candied fruits, wood-carvings, and toys; women went to and fro bearing trays full of a chocolate-colored mixture dotted with the white kernels of pine-cones. This looked very rich and nice, and the poor people bought great slices of it. Pauline once invested a penny therein, but a single taste proved enough; it was sour and oily at once, and she gave the rest to a small Italian girl, who looked delighted, and gobbled it up in huge mouthfuls. Whenever they went out to walk, there were fresh pleasures. The narrow street led directly to a shining sunlit river, which streamed through the heart of the city like a silver ribbon. Beautiful bridges spanned this river, some reared on graceful arches, some with statues at either end, one set all along its course by quaint stalls filled with gold and silver filigree, chains of amber, and turquoises blue as the sky. All over the city were delightful pictures, churches, and gardens, open and free to all who chose to come. Every day mamma and the children went somewhere and saw something, and, in spite of papa's absence, the winter was a happy one.  Going to and fro in the city, the children had often looked up the Fiesole hill, which is visible from many parts of Florence, and Pauline had conceived a strong wish to go there. Molly did not care so much, but as she always wanted to do what Pauline did, she joined her older sister in begging to go. Mamma, however, thought it too far for a walk, and carriage hire cost something; so she said no, and the girls were forced to content themselves with \"making believe\" what they would do if ever they went there,--a sort of play in which they both delighted. None of the things they imagined proved true when they did go there, as you shall hear.  It was just as they were expecting papa back, that, coming in one day from a walk with Signora Goldi, Pauline and Molly found mamma hard at work packing a travelling-bag. She looked very pale, and had been crying. No wonder, for the mail had brought a letter to say that papa, travelling alone from Egypt, had landed at Brindisi very ill with Syrian fever. The kind strangers who wrote the letter would stay with and take care of him till mamma could get there, but she must come at once.  \"What _shall_ I do?\" cried poor Mrs. Hale, appealing in her distress to Signora Goldi. \"I cannot take the children into a fever-room, and even if that were safe, the journey costs so much that it would be out of the question. Mr. Hale left me only money enough to last till his return. After settling with you and buying my ticket, I shall have very little remaining. Help me, padrona! Advise me what to do.\"  Signora Goldi's advertisement said, \"English spoken,\" but the English was of a kind which English people found it hard to understand. Her kind heart, however, stood her instead of language, and helped her to guess the meaning of Mrs. Hale's words.  \"Such peety!\" she said. \"Had I know, I not have let rooms for week after. The signora said 'let' and she sure to go, so I let, else the _piccoli_ should stay wiss me. Now what?\" and she rubbed her nose hard, and wrinkled her forehead in a puzzled way. \"I have!\" she cried at last, her face beaming. \"How the _piccolini_ like go to Fiesole for a little? My brother who dead, he leave Engleis wife. She lady-maid once, speak Engleis well as me!--better! She have _pensione_--very small, but good--ah, so good, and it cost little, with air _si buono, si fresco_!\"  The signora was drifting into Italian without knowing it, but was stopped by the joyous exclamations of the two girls.  \"Fiesole! Oh, mamma! just what we wanted so much!\" cried Pauline. \"Do let us go there!\"  \"Do, do!\" chimed in Molly. \"I saw the padrona's sister once, and she's so nice. Say yes, please, mamma.\"  The \"yes\" was not quite a happy one, but what could poor Mrs. Hale do? No better plan offered, time pressed, she hoped not to be obliged to stay long away from the children, and, as the signora said, the Fiesole hill-top must be airy and wholesome. So the arrangement was made, the terms settled, a carriage was called, and in what seemed to the girls a single moment, mamma had rattled away, with the signora to buy her ticket and see her off at the station. They looked at each other disconsolately, and their faces grew very long.  \"We're just like orphans in a book,\" sobbed Pauline at last, while Molly watered Matilda's best frock with salt tears. The signora had a specially nice supper that night, and petted them a great deal, but they were very homesick for mamma, and cried themselves to sleep.  Matters seemed brighter when they woke up next morning to find a lovely day, such a day as only Italy knows, with sunshine like gold, sky of clearest blue, and the river valley shining through soft mists like finest filtered rainbows. By a happy chance the Fiesole sister-in-law came to Florence that morning, and drove up to the door in a droll little cart drawn by a mouse-colored mule, with a green carrot-top stuck over his left ear and a bell round his neck. She gladly agreed to lodge the children, and her pleasant old face and English voice made them at once at home with her. There was just room in the cart for their trunk, and about five in the afternoon they set out, perched on the narrow bench in front, one on each side of their new friend, and holding each other's hands tightly behind her ample back. Signora Bianchi was the sister-in-law's name, but \"padrona\" was easier to say, and they called her so from the beginning.  The hill-road was nowhere steep, but each winding turn took them higher and higher above Florence. They could see the curvings of the river, the bridges, the cathedral dome, and the tall, beautiful bell-tower, which they had been told was the work of the great artist Giotto. Further on, the road was shut in between stone walls. Over the tops of these hung rose-vines, full of fresh pink roses, though it was early March. Pauline and Molly screamed with pleasure, and the padrona, driving her mule close under the wall, dragged down a branch and let them gather the flowers for themselves, which was delightful. She would not stop, however, when, a little later, they came to fields gay with red and purple anemones, yellow tulips, and oddly colored wild lilies so dark as to be almost black; there were plenty of such on top of the hill, she said, and they must not be too late in getting home. The black lilies were _giglios_,--the emblem or badge of the city of Florence; the children had not seen them before, but they remembered the form of the flower in the carved shields over the door of some of the old buildings.  The road ended in a small paved _piazza_, which is the Italian name for an open square. All about it stood old buildings, houses and churches, and a very ancient cathedral with a dirty leather curtain hanging before its door. Passing these, the mule clattered down a narrow side-street, or rather lane. The streets in Florence had seemed dark and dirty; but what were they compared with this alley, in which the wheels of the little cart grazed the walls on either side as it passed along? Rickety flights of outside stairs led to the upper stories of the buildings; overhead, lines of linen, hung out to dry, were flapping in the wind. An ill-smelling stream of water trickled over the rough cobble-stone pavement. Jolt, jolt, jolt!--then the mule turned suddenly into a dark place which looked like a shabby stable-yard. It was the ground-floor of the padrona's house, and this was the place where Pauline and Molly were to stay! They looked at each other with dismayed faces.  But the padrona called them to follow, and led the way up one stone staircase after another till they came to the third story. Here things were pleasanter. It was plain and bare; the floors were of brick, there were no carpets, and the furniture was scanty and old, but the rooms were large and airy, and through the open casement bright rays of sunshine streamed in. Pauline ran to the window, and behold, instead of the dirty lane, she saw the open piazza, and beyond, a glimpse of the blue hills and the Florence valley! She called Molly, and, perched on the broad sill, they watched the sunset and chattered like happy birds, while the padrona bustled to and fro, preparing supper and spreading coarse clean linen on the beds of a little chamber which opened from the sitting-room. The padrona's kitchen was about the size of an American closet. The stove was a stone shelf with two holes in it, just big enough to contain a couple of quarts of charcoal. It was like a doll's kitchen, Molly thought; and Pauline stared when she saw the padrona produce a palm-leaf fan and begin to fan the fire, as if it were faint and needed to be revived. But as she gazed, the charcoal was coaxed into a glow, the little pots and pans bubbled, and hey, presto! supper was ready, with half the trouble and a quarter the fuel which would have been needed to set one of our big home ranges going. It was a queer supper, but very good, the children thought; their long drive had made them hungry, and the omelette, salad, and _polenta_, or fried mush, tasted delicious. Everything was nice but the bread, which was dark in color and had an unpleasant sour taste. The padrona smiled when she saw them put aside their untasted slices, and said that she too used to dislike Italian bread, but that now she preferred it to any other.  The padrona was delighted with her young visitors. She had long been a widow. One of her sons was in the army, and seldom at home; the other helped her about the house and tilled a little meadow which belonged to them. She had no daughter to keep her company, and the sweet, bright-faced American girls pleased her greatly. She helped the sisters to undress, and tucked them into their beds as kindly as any old nurse, and they fell asleep with her pleasant voice in their ears: \"Good-night and good dreams, little miss.\"  The morrow brought another fine day, and the girls improved it for a ramble about the quaint town. It seemed to them the very _oldest_ place they had ever seen--and, in fact, Fiesole is older far than Florence, of which it was first the cradle and afterward the foe. They stood a long time before the windows of the straw-shop, choosing the things they would like to buy _if_ they had any money! Pauline fell in love with a straw parasol, and Molly hankered after a work-basket for mamma. Both of them felt that it was dreadful to be poor, but there was no help for it. Then they climbed to an upper terrace and sat a long time looking on the fine view it commanded, and talking in gestures to some brown little children who came up to beg from them. After that, they lifted the curtain over the cathedral door, and stole quietly about the ancient church. It was dark and shabby and worm-eaten; but as they wandered to and fro they came upon beautiful things,--tombs of sculptured marble with figures of saints and madonnas, wreaths of marble flowers, bits of old carved wood as black as ebony. It was strange to find such treasures hidden away in the dust and gloom, and to think that there they were, dusty and gloomy and old, before Columbus discovered the very new continent which we call America! A queer smell breathed about the place, a smell of must and age and dried-up incense. Pauline and Molly were glad to get away from it and feel the fresh air and the sunshine again. They rambled on to the western slope of the hill, and a little way down, where the land descends in terraces to the wooded valley below, they came upon the ruins of a Roman amphitheatre. They had never seen an amphitheatre before, but they guessed what it was from a picture which mamma had shown them. On the ledges which once were seats, where spectators seated in rows had watched the lions and the gladiators fight, crowds of purple violets now lifted their sweet faces to the sky.  After that, the amphitheatre became their favorite walk, and they went back every day. The padrona warned them against sitting long on the ground or staying out till the sunset dews fell, but they heeded what she said very little; it seemed impossible that so pleasant a spot could have any harm about it. But at last came a morning when Pauline recollected the padrona's warnings, with a great frightened heart-jump, for Molly waked up hot and thirsty, and, when she lifted her head from the pillow, let it fall back again, and complained of being dizzy. The padrona made her some tea, and after a while she felt better and got up. But all that day and the next she looked pale, and dragged one foot after the other as she went about, and the third day fever came upon her in good earnest. Tea did no good this time, and she lay still and heavy, with burning hands and flushed cheeks. The padrona tried various simple medicines, and Pauline sat all day bathing Molly's head and fanning her, but neither medicine nor fanning was of use; and as night came on, and the fever grew higher, Molly began to toss and call for mamma, and to cry out about her pillow, which was stuffed with wool and very hard.  \"I don't like this pillow, Pauline--indeed I don't, it makes my neck ache so! Why don't you take it away, Pauline, and give me a nice soft pillow, such as we used to have at home? And I want some ice, and some good American water to drink. This water is bad. I can't drink it. Make the ice clink in the tumbler, please--because if I hear it clink I shan't be thirsty any more. And call mamma. I must see mamma. Mamma!\"  And Molly tried to get up, and then tumbled back and fell into a doze, while poor Pauline sat beside her with a lump in her throat which seemed to grow worse every moment, and to bid fair to choke her entirely if it didn't stop. She did not dare to sob aloud, for fear of rousing Molly, but the tears ran quietly down her cheeks as she thought of home and mamma. Where was she? How was papa? Why didn't they write? And, oh dear! what should she, should she do, if Molly were to be very ill in that lonely place, where there was no doctor or any of the nice things which people in sickness need so much? No one can imagine how forlorn Pauline felt--that is, no one who has not tried the experiment of taking care of a sick friend in a foreign land, where the ways and customs are strange and uncomfortable, and the necessaries of good nursing cannot be had.  Nobody in the world could be kinder than was the padrona to her young invalid guest. Night after night she sat up, all day long she watched and nursed and cooked and comforted. Pauline clung to this friend in need as to the only helper left in the wide world. Beppo, the padrona's son, walked into Florence and brought out a little Italian doctor, who ordered beef-tea, horrified Pauline by a hint of bleeding, and left, promising to come again, which promise he didn't keep. Pauline was glad that he did not; she felt no confidence in the little doctor, and she knew, besides, that doctors cost money, and the small sum which mamma left was almost gone. Day after day passed, Molly growing no better, the padrona more anxious, Pauline more unhappy. It seemed as if years and years had gone by since mamma left them,--almost as if it were a dream that they ever had a mamma, or a home, or any of the happy things which now looked so sadly far away.  Then came the darkest day of all, when Molly lay so white and motionless that Pauline thought her dead; when the padrona sat for hours, putting a spoonful of something between the pale lips every little while, but never speaking, and the moments dragged along as though shod with lead. Morning grew to noon, noon faded into the dimness of twilight, still the white face on the pillow did not stir, and still the padrona sat silently and dropped in her spoonfuls. At last she stopped, laid down the spoon, bent over Molly, and listened. Was any breath at all coming from the quiet lips?  \"Oh, padrona, is she dead?\" sobbed Pauline, burying her face in the bedclothes.  \"No, she is asleep,\" said the padrona. Then she hid her own face and said a prayer of thankfulness, while Pauline wept for joy, hushing herself as much as possible, that Molly might not be disturbed.  All that night and far into the morning the blessed sleep continued, and when Molly awoke the fever was gone. She was very white, and as weak as a baby; but Pauline and the padrona were happy again, for they knew that she was going to get well.  So another week crept by, each day bringing a little more strength and appetite to Molly, and a little more color to her pale face, and then the padrona thought she might venture to sit up. They propped her up in a big chair with many pillows (\"brickbats\" Molly called them), and had just pulled her across the room to the window, when a carriage rattled on the stones below, somebody ran upstairs, and into the room burst mamma! Yes, the little mamma herself, pale as Molly almost, from the fright she had gone through; but so overjoyed to see them, and so relieved at finding Molly up and getting well, that there was nothing for it but a hearty cry, in which all took part, and which did them all a great deal of good.  Then came explanations. Papa was a great deal better. The doctor thought the fever would do him good in the end rather than harm. But he was still weak, and mamma had left him to rest at the hotel in Florence while she flew up the hill to her children. Why didn't she write? She _had_ written, again and again, but the letters had gone astray somehow, and none of the girls' notes had reached her except one from Molly, written just after they went to Fiesole. I may as well say now that all these missing letters followed them to America three months later, with a great deal of postage to be paid on them; but they were not of much use _then_, as you can imagine!  There was so much to say and to hear that it seemed as though they could never get through. Pauline held mamma's hand tight, and cried and laughed by turns.  \"It was dreadful!\" she said. \"It was just exactly as if you and papa and everybody we knew were dead and we were left all alone. And I thought Molly would die too, and then what would have become of me? The padrona has been so kind--you can't think how kind. She sat up nine nights with Molly, and always said she wasn't tired; but I knew she was. I used to think it must be the nicest place in the world up here at Fiesole, but I never want to see it again in all my life.\"  \"Don't say that, for Molly has got well here. And the good padrona too! You ought to love Fiesole for her sake.\"  \"So I ought. And I do love her. But you'll not ever go away and leave us _anywhere_ again, will you, mamma?\"  \"Not if I can help it,\" replied mamma, speaking over Molly's head, which was nestled comfortably on her shoulder. There were tears in her eyes as she spoke. It had not been possible to help it, but the tender mother's heart felt it a wrong to her children that they should have been without her in sickness.  It was another week before Molly could be moved. Mamma drove up twice during that time, bringing oranges and wine and all sorts of nice things, and the last time a parcel with a present in it for the children to give to the padrona. It was a pretty silk shawl and a small gold pin to fasten it. Pauline and Molly were enchanted to make this gift, and the padrona admired the shawl extremely; but Mrs. Hale sorrowfully longed to be richer, that she might heap many tokens of gratitude in the kind hands which had worked so lovingly for her little girls in their trouble.  \"I can't bear to say good-bye,\" were Molly's last words as she leaned from the carriage for a parting hug. \"Dear padrona, how I wish you would just come with us to America and live there. We would call you 'aunty' and love you so, and be so glad, you can't think! Do come!\"  But the padrona, smiling and tearful, shook her head and declared that she could never leave her boys and the hill-top and old neighbors, but must stay in Fiesole as long as she lived. So with many kisses and blessings the good-byes were uttered, and out of the narrow street and across the piazza rattled the carriage, and so down the hill-road to Florence.  Pauline and Molly are safe in America now. They tell the girls at school a great deal about what they saw and where they went, but they don't talk much of the time of Molly's illness; and when Matilda Maria, who lives in a drawer now, entertains the other dolls with tales of travel, she skips that. It is still too fresh in their memories, and too sad, for them to like to speak of it. But sometimes, after they go to bed at night, they put their heads on the same pillow and whisper to each other about the old church, the amphitheatre, the padrona, those days of fever, and all the other things that happened to them when mamma went away and left them alone at Fiesole.     QUEEN BLOSSOM.   PROMPTLY the bell tinkled for noon recess in the red school-house, and boys and girls came trooping out into the sunshine, which was warm as summer that day. Nobody stayed behind except Miss Sparks, the teacher. She turned the damper in the stove to make it warmer, and put on more wood; then took a roll of bread and butter and a large pickled cucumber out of her desk and sat down to lunch, and to read Young's \"Night Thoughts,\" which somebody had told her was an \"improving\" book. The heat soon made her head ache, and \"Night Thoughts\" and the cucumber aiding, the children, had they only known it, were in a fair way to pass an extremely unpleasant afternoon.  Luckily they did not know it, otherwise the pleasure of the recess would have been spoiled, which would have been a pity, for the recess was very pleasant. There was the sun for one thing; and real, warm, yellow sun is a treat in April, not always to be had. There were the woods, beginning to be beautiful, although not a leaf-bud was yet visible. Spring was awake, and busy at her silent work, varnishing brown boughs to glossy brightness, tinting shoots and twigs with pink and yellow and soft red colors, arranging surprises everywhere. The children could not have put into words the feeling which made the day so delightful, but all were aware of it, and each, in his or her way, prepared to enjoy the hour. One tiny snow-drift remained in a leaf-strewn hollow. The boys found it out, and fell to snow-balling with the zest of those who do not hope to see snow again for many a long month. Big girls, with arms about each other's waists, walked to and fro, whispering together. The smaller children cuddled into a sunny fence corner, and, like Wordsworth's village maid,            \"Took their little porringers,            And ate their dinners there.\"  A group of girls, not so big as those, nor so little as these, strolled off into the woods, talking as they went.  \"Now you just hush up, Winnie Boker,\" said one. \"It's no use, for we won't have her. She's been Queen ever so many times, and now it's somebody else's turn. There are other girls in town besides Blossom, I guess.\"  \"Oh yes, Marianne; it isn't _that_,\" broke in Winnie, the words running out of her eager mouth so fast that they tumbled over each other. \"It isn't that at all. You'd make a first-rate Queen, or so would Arabella or Eunice. But, don't you see, Blossom always _was_ Queen, and now she's sick I'm afraid she'd feel badly if we chose somebody else.\"  \"Dear me, what nonsense!\" exclaimed Arabella, a tall girl in purple calico, with sharp black eyes and a Roman nose. \"It wasn't fair a bit, ma says, to have Blossom always. Ma says other people have got rights too. You needn't be so fiery about that stuck-up Blossom, Winnie.\"  \"Oh, I'm not,\" began Winnie, peaceably, \"but--\"  \"My father says that Blossom is the prettiest girl in the whole township,\" broke in Charlie Starr, excitedly; \"and it's real mean of you to call her stuck-up. Don't you recollect how sweet she looked last year in her white dress, and what a pretty speech she made when George Thorne put the crown on her head? _She_ never said unkind things or called anybody names! She's always been May-Queen, and I say it's a shame to leave her out just because she's sick.\"  \"You're a goose,\" responded Arabella. \"Who wants a sick Queen of the May? She'll never be well again, the doctor says; and as for her beauty, that's gone for good. Ma declares that it's absurd to call her Blossom any more. It isn't her real name, only her pa named her so when she was little, because he was so proud of her looks. Her real name's Sarah Jane, and I'm going to call her Sarah Jane always. So there now, Charlotte Starr!\"  \"You bad girl!\" cried Charlie, almost in tears. \"How can you! Poor dear Blossom!\"  \"Stop quarrelling,\" said Laura Riggs, \"and listen to my plan. Blossom can't be Queen, anyhow, don't you see, because she's too sick to come to the celebration. So what's the use of fighting about her?\"  \"I thought we could go to her, and put on the crown and all, and it would be _such_ a surprise,\" ventured Winnie, timidly. \"She'd be so pleased.\"  \"I suppose she would,\" sneered Arabella, \"only, you see, we don't mean to do it.\"  \"I propose that we call all the boys and girls together after school, and vote who shall be Queen,\" went on Laura. \"Then to-morrow we can go a flower-hunting, and have the wreath all ready for next day. It's splendid that May-day comes on Saturday this year.\"  \"I know who I shall vote for,--and I,--and I,\" cried the children.  Winnie and Charlotte did not join in the cry. They moved a little way off, and looked sadly at each other. To them, poor Blossom, sick and neglected, seemed still the rightful Queen of the May.  \"I've thought of a plan,\" whispered Charlie.  \"What?\"  But the answer was so softly spoken that nobody but Winnie could hear.  Did I say _nobody?_ I was wrong. Certain fine ears which were listening heard all, question and answer both. These ears belonged to a little hepatica, who had stolen up very near the surface of the ground to hearken, and, with a tiny leaf-hand curled behind her lilac ear, had caught every syllable. Whatever the secret was, it pleased her, for she clapped both hands and called out,--  \"Listen! listen! Hepsy, Patty, Violet,--all of you,--listen!\"  \"What is it--what?\" cried the other flowers, crowding near her.  \"Didn't you hear what those two little girls were saying,--Winnie and--what _is_ her name--Charlie?\"  \"No, we heard nothing. We were listening to the tiresome ones who quarrelled. How horrid children are!\"  \"Go a flower-hunting indeed,\" tittered a bloodroot. \"They are welcome to hunt, but they will find no flowers.\"  \"Indeed they won't. I'd bite if they tried to pick me,\" said a dog-tooth violet.  \"Ach! fancy their fingers at your stem,\" shuddered a pale wind-flower.  \"How little they guessed that we were listening to it all,\" laughed a white anemone.            \"Ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling,            We'll be as late as we can this spring,\"  sang a columbine.  \"We know when to go and when to stay; when to open and when to shut,\" said a twin-flower.  \"Where is Mamma Spring?\" inquired the dog-tooth violet.  \"On the other side the wood,\" replied the columbine. \"But she can't be interrupted just now. She's very busy cutting out Dutchman's Breeches. There are five hundred pairs to be finished before night.\"  \"All of the same everlasting old pattern,\" grumbled a trillium.  \"But listen; you don't listen,\" urged the lilac hepatica. \"_All_ the children didn't quarrel. My two--the two I liked--were gentle and sweet, and they have a plan--a kind plan--about somebody named Blossom. They want to give her a surprise with flowers and a wreath, and make her Queen of the May, because she is ill and lies in bed. Let us help. I like them; and Blossom is a pretty name.\"  \"Are you quite sure they did not quarrel?\" asked the wind-flower, anxiously. \"It made me shiver to hear the others.\"  \"No, they didn't quarrel. When the rest would not listen, they moved away and made their little plan in a whisper.\"  \"And what was the plan?\" inquired the bloodroot.  \"Oh, they are wise little things. The others are going to have a 'celebration' on Saturday, with a great deal of pie and cake and fuss. I shall tell Mamma Spring to order up an east wind and freeze them well, little monsters! But my two are coming into the woods quietly to-morrow to search for flowers. I heard Charlie tell Winnie that she knew where the first May-flowers always come out, and they would look there. We know too, don't we? In the hollow behind the beech-wood, on the south bank.\"  \"They're not there yet,\" said the columbine, yawning.  \"No, but they're all packed and ready,\" said the lilac hepatica. \"Do let us telegraph them to start at once. I somehow feel as if I should like to please Blossom too.\"  So the trillium, who was telegraph operator, stooped down and dragged up a thread-like root, fine as wire.  \"What is the message?\" he asked.  \"Be--in--flower--by--to-morrow--noon--for--Charlie--and--Winnie,\" dictated the hepatica. \"Precisely ten words.\"  \"All right,\" responded the bloodroot, with his fingers on the wire. Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap; the message was sent, and presently came an answering vibration.  \"All right. We are off.\" It was the reply of the May-flowers.  \"What a fine thing is the telegraph!\" sighed a sentimental sand-violet, while the hepatica rubbed her little lilac palms gleefully, and exclaimed,--  \"I flatter myself that job is as good as done. Hurrah for Queen Blossom!\"  The other girls did not notice Winnie and Charlie particularly next day as they stole from the rest and crept away almost on tiptoe to the south bank, where the arbutus _might_ be in bloom. Drifted leaves hid the bottom of the hollow. At first sight there was no promise of flowers; but our little maids were too wise to be discouraged. Carefully they picked their way down, brushed aside the brown leaves, and presently a shriek from both announced discovery.  \"Oh, the darlings!\" cried Winnie.  There they were, the prompt, punctual May-flowers, so lately arrived that only half their leaves were uncurled, and the dust of travel still lay on their tendrils. For all that, they were not too tired to smile at the happy faces that bent over them as the little girls lifted the leaf blankets and gently drew them from their hiding-place. Pale buds winked and brightened; the fuller flowers opened wide pink eyes; all shook their ivory incense-bottles at once, and sent out sweet smells, which mixed deliciously with the fragrance of fresh earth, of moving sap, and sun-warmed mosses.  \"Shouldn't you think they had come out on purpose?\" said Winnie, kissing one of the pinkest clusters.  \"We did! we did!\" cried the May-flowers in chorus. But the children did not understand the flower-language, though the flowers knew well what the children said. Flowers are very clever, you see; much cleverer than little girls.  Winnie and Charlie hid their treasures in a tin dinner-pail, pouring in a little water to keep them fresh, and carefully shutting the lid. They did not want to have their secret found out.  Going home, they met the others, looking somewhat disconsolate.  \"Where _have_ you been?\" they cried. \"We looked everywhere for you.\"  \"Oh, in the woods,\" said Winnie, while Charlie asked,--  \"Did you find any flowers?\"  \"Not one,\" cried Arabella, crossly; \"the spring is so late; it's a shame. Carrie Briggs is chosen Queen, and Miriam Gray is going to lend us some paper flowers for the crown. They will do just as well.\"  \"Paper flowers!\" began Charlie, indignantly; but Winnie checked her, and pretty soon their path turned off from that of the others.  \"Come early to-morrow and help us make the throne,\" called out Marianne.  \"We can't: we've got something else to do,\" called back Charlie.  \"What?\"  \"We're going to see Blossom.\"  \"Oh, pshaw! Do let that everlasting Sarah Jane alone, and come and have a good time,\" screamed Arabella after them.  Winnie laughed and shook her head. The others went on.  Blossom lay in bed next morning. She always lay in bed now, and it was pitiful to see what a pale blossom she had become. Only a year before her cheeks had been rosier, her limbs more active, than those of any of the children who daily passed her window on their way to school. One unlucky slip on the ice had brought all this to an end, and now the doctor doubted if ever she could get up and be well and strong as she used to be. The pretty name, given in her days of babyhood, sounded sadly now to the parents who watched her so anxiously; but no name could be too sweet, her mother thought, for the dear, patient child, who bore her pain so brightly and rewarded all care and kindness with such brave smiles. Blossom she was still, though white and thin, and Blossom she would always be, although she might never bloom again as once she did, until set in the Lord's garden, where no frosts come to hurt the flowers.  \"Happy May-day,\" she said, as her mother came in. \"I wonder what the girls are doing. Winnie didn't come yesterday. I don't even know who is to be Queen. Have you heard, mamma?\"  \"I shouldn't think they'd want to have any Queen on such a cold day as this,\" replied mamma. \"Look how the boughs are blowing in the wind. It feels like March out doors.\"  \"Oh, they're sure to want a Queen,\" said Blossom. \"May-day is such fun. I used to like it better than any day in the year.\"  \"Somebody wants to spake to ye, ma'am, if you pl'ase,\" said Norah, putting her head in at the door.  \"Very well. Blossom, dear, you don't mind being left alone for a minute?\"  \"Oh no, indeed. I've such a nice book here.\" But Blossom did not open her book after mamma went away, but lay looking out of the window to where the elm-boughs were rocking in the wind. Her face grew a little sad.  \"How nice it used to be!\" she said to herself.  Just then she heard a queer noise in the entry--drumming, and something else which sounded like music. Next, the door opened, and a procession of two marched in. Charlie was the head of the procession. She wore a pink-and-white calico, and tied about her neck with a pink string was Willie Smith's drum, borrowed for the occasion. Winnie, in her best blue gingham, brought up the rear, her mouth full of harmonica. Winnie also carried a flat basket, covered with a white napkin, and the two girls kept step as they marched across the room to Blossom's bedside, who lay regarding them with eyes wide open from amazement.  \"Happy May-day, Queen Blossom,\" sang Charlie, flourishing her drumsticks.  \"Happy May-day, Queen Blossom,\" chimed in Winnie, taking the harmonica from her mouth.  \"Happy May-day,\" responded Blossom.  \"But--how funny--what do you call me Queen Blossom for?\"  \"Because you _are_ Queen, and we have come to crown you,\" replied Charlie. Then she laid down the drumsticks, lifted the white napkin, and in a solemn tone began to repeat these verses, which she and Winnie--with a little help from somebody, I guess--had written the evening before.            Never mind who the others choose;             You are the Queen for us;           They're welcome to their paper flowers                     And fuss.            We bring our Queen a wreath of May,             And put it on her head,           And crown her sweetest, though she lies                     In bed.            These flowers, dear Blossom, bloomed for you,             The fairest in the land;           Wear them, and give your subjects leave to kiss                     Your hand.  Charlie finished the verses with great gravity. Then, drawing the May-wreath from the basket, she put it on Blossom's head, after which, instead of kissing the royal hand, according to programme, she clapped both her own and began to dance about the bed exclaiming,--  \"Wasn't that nice? Aren't they pretty? We made them up ourselves--Winnie and I. Why, Blossom, you're crying.\"  In fact, Queen Blossom _was_ crying.  It was only a very little cry--just a drop or two, with a rainbow to follow. In another minute Blossom had winked the tears away, and was smiling brightly.  \"I didn't mean to cry,\" she exclaimed, \"only I was so surprised. I thought you would all be busy to-day, and nobody would come. I never dreamed that I should be made Queen of the May again. How kind you are, dear Charlie and Winnie, and where _did_ you get the flowers--real May-flowers? Nobody has begun to look for them yet.\"  \"They came out on purpose for you,\" persisted Charlie; and the May-buds smiled and nodded approvingly as she said so.  Next, Winnie opened her basket, and behold! a cake, with white icing, and in the middle a pink thing meant for a crown, but looking more like a cuttle-fish, because of the icing's having melted a little. Mrs. Boker had stayed up late the night before to bake and ice this May-day loaf. She, too, loved Blossom, and it pleased her that Winnie should plan for the enjoyment of her sick friend.  A knife was brought, and slices cut. Blossom lay on her pillows, nibbling daintily, as befits a Queen. Her subjects, perched on the bed, ate with the appetite of commoners. The sun struggled out, and, in spite of the east wind, sent a broad yellow ray into the window. Blossom's May-wreath made the air delicious; there could not have been found a merrier party.  \"Please, dear Duchess, take off my crown for a minute,\" said Blossom, with a pretty air of command.  The Duchess, otherwise Charlie, obeyed, and laid the wreath on the coverlet just under the royal nose.  \"How lovely, lovely, lovely it is!\" said Blossom, with a long sigh of delight.  \"The sun is streaming exactly into your eyes, dear,\" said her mother.  She opened the window to close the shutter. A sharp, sudden gust of wind blew in, and mamma pulled the sash down quickly lest Blossom should be chilled. Nobody noticed that one of the May-flowers, as if watching its chance, detached itself from the wreath, and flew out of window on the back of the interloping wind. But it did.  The wind evidently knew what was expected of it, for it bore the May-flower along to the woods, and laid it on the brown earth in a certain sunny spot. Then, like a horse released from rider, it pranced away, while the flower, putting her pink lips to the ground, called in a tiny voice,--  \"Hepatica--Hepsy dear, are you there?\"  \"Yes; what is it?\" came back an answering voice, which sounded very close. It was the voice of the lilac hepatica. She and her companions were much nearer the surface than they had been two days before.  \"It has all gone off so nicely,\" went on the May-blossom. \"We were there in time, and I must say I never saw nicer children than that Winnie and Charlie. They picked us so gently that it scarcely hurt at all. As for Blossom, she's a little dear. Her eyes loved us, and how tenderly she handled our stems. I really wanted to stay with her, only I had such a good chance to go, and I thought you would all want to hear. It was the nicest May-day party I ever saw.\"  \"More--tell us more,\" said the underground flowers.  \"There is no more to tell,\" replied the May-flower, faintly. \"It is cold out here, and I am growing sleepy. Good-night.\"  After that there was silence in the woods.  Winnie and Charlie never knew how the dear little flower-people had conspired to make their May-day happy. Perhaps Blossom guessed, for when she laid aside her wreath that night she kissed the soft petals, which had begun to droop a little, and whispered gently,--  \"Thank you, darlings.\"     A SMALL BEGINNING.   A LITTLE ground-floor room, a little fire in a small stove, burning dully as fires are apt to do at times when their blaze might be worth something in the way of cheer; out doors the raw gray of a spring thaw; on the window-seat two girls crouched together and looking out with faces as disconsolate as the weather. Such was the picture presented at No. 13 Farewell Street, three years ago last March.  Farewell Street was so named because of its being the customary route of exit from the old cemetery, the point where mourners were supposed to turn for a last look at the gates which had just shut in the newly buried friend; and this association, as well as the glimpse of tall cemetery fence, topped with mournful evergreens which bounded the view, did not tend to make the sad outlook any the less sad on that dismal day. For it was only a fortnight since Delia and Hetty Willett, the girls on the window-seat, had left within those gates the kind old grandmother who for years had stood to them in the stead of father and mother both.  \"The Willetts,\" as the neighbors called them, using the collective phrase always, were twins, and just eighteen years old. Bearing to each other even a stronger personal likeness than twins customarily possess, they were in other points curiously unlike. Delia was soft and clinging, Hetty vigorous and self-reliant. Delia loved to be guided, Hetty to guide; the former had few independent views and opinions, the latter was brimful of ideas and fancies, plans and purposes; some crude, some foolish, but all her own. Yet, oddly enough, it was Delia, very often, who gave the casting vote in their decisions, for Hetty's love for her slender twin was a sentiment so deep and intense that she often yielded against her own better sense and judgment, simply for the pleasure of yielding to what Delia wished. Delia in return adored her sister, waited on her, petted, consoled, \"exactly as if she were Hetty's wife,\" Aunt Polly said, \"and the worst was they suited each other so well that no one else would ever suit either of them, and they were bound to die old maids in consequence!\"  But eighteen can laugh at such auguries, and there was no thought or question of marriage in the minds of the sisters as they crouched that afternoon close together on the old window-seat.  A very different question absorbed them, and a perplexing one; how they were to live, namely, and to keep together while doing so, which meant pretty much the same thing to them both. Grandmother's death had left them with so very, very little. Her annuity died with her. There was the old house, the plain, worn furniture to which they had been accustomed all their lives, and about a hundred dollars a year! What could they do with that?  \"If one of us only happened to be clever,\" sighed Delia. \"If I could paint pictures, or you had a talent for writing, how easy it would be!\"  \"I don't know as to that,\" responded Hetty. \"Seems to me I've heard of people who did those things, and yet didn't find it so mighty easy to get along. Somebody's got to buy the pictures after they're painted, you know, and read the books, and pay for them.\" She spoke in an absent tone, and her brow was knitted into the little frown which Delia knew betokened that her twin was puzzling hard over something.  \"Don't scowl, it'll spoil your forehead,\" she said, smoothing out the objectionable frown with her fingers.  \"Was I scowling? Well, never mind. I'm trying to think, Dely. You can't paint and I can't write. The question is, What can we do?\"  \"That _is_ a question,\" said a voice at the door. It was Aunt Polly's voice. She managed on most days to drop in and \"give a look to them, the lonely little creeturs,\" as she would have expressed it.  \"You're consultin', I see,\" she said, taking in the situation at a glance: the dismal room, the depressive and tearful cheeks of the two girls, the lack of comfort and cheer. She twitched open the stove door as she passed, threw in a stick of wood, twirled the damper, and gave a brisk, rattling shake to the ashes,--all with a turn of her hand as it were,--attentions to which the stove presently responded with a brisk roar. \"Well, it's time you did. I was planning to have a talk with you before long, for you ought to settle to something. Pull the blind down, Dely, and, Hetty, you light the lamp, and come to the fire, both of you, and let's see what we can make of it. It's a tangled skein enough, I don't deny it; but most skeins are that, and there's always a right end somewhere, if the Lord'll give us sense enough to get hold of it and keep on pulling out and winding up.\"  Presently the girls were seated close to Aunt Polly's rocking-chair. The room looked more cheerful now with the lamplight and the yellow glow from the stove, and both were conscious of a sense of hopefulness.  \"Now--what _can_ you do?\" demanded Aunt Polly, whirling round in her chair so as to face them.  \"We hadn't got so far as that when you came in,\" replied Hetty; \"I suppose we must do what other people do in the same circumstances.\"  \"What's that?\"  \"Teach something, or sew, I suppose.\"  \"Sewing's slow starvation, in my opinion, unless you've got a machine, which you haven't, and not much better then. What do you know that you can teach?\"  \"Not much,\" replied Hetty, humbly, while Delia added hesitatingly, \"We could teach children their letters, perhaps.\"  \"I presume you could,\" responded Aunt Polly, dryly. \"But, though you mayn't know it, perhaps, there are about fifty women in this town can do the same, and who mean to do it, what's more. And most of 'em have got the start of you in one way or another, so what's your chance worth? No, girls, sewing and teaching are played out. They are good things in their way, but every woman who's got her living to earn thinks of them the very first thing and of nothing else, and the market is always overstocked. My advice to you is, to _think up something you can do better than other people_--that's what gives folks a real chance! Now, what is there?\"  \"There isn't anything I can do better than other people,\" cried the dismayed Delia. \"Nor Hetty either--except make gingerbread,\" she added, with a faint little laugh. \"Hetty beats everybody at that, grandmother always said.\"  \"Very well; make gingerbread then. That's your thing to do,\" said Aunt Polly.  Hetty looked at her with incredulous eyes.  \"You're not in earnest, are you?\" she said.  \"I am. In dead earnest.\"  \"But, Aunt Polly, _gingerbread_! Such a little thing as that! Who ever heard of a girl's doing such a thing?\"  \"All the better if they never did. A new trade has a double chance. As for the 'little,' great things often come from small beginnings. Fortunes have been made out of gingerbread before now, I'll be bound, or if not that, out of something no bigger. No, Hetty, depend upon it, if your gingerbread is _best_, folks will want it. And if your teaching or sewing is only second best, they won't. It's the law of human nature, and a very good law, too, though it cuts the wrong way sometimes, like all laws.\"  \"Aunt Polly, you're a genius!\" cried Hetty, warmed into sudden glow by this vigorous common sense. \"I _can_ make good gingerbread, and it's just as you say, neither of us know enough to teach well, and we are both poor hands at sewing, and we should have a much better chance if we tried to do what we can and not what we can't. Why shouldn't I make gingerbread? Dely'd help me, and if folks liked our things and bought them, we could live and keep together. We could make a kind of shop of this room, couldn't we? What do you think?\"  \"'Tisn't a bad place for such a trade,\" said Aunt Polly, slowly, measuring the room with her eyes. \"Being on a corner is an advantage, you see; and there's that double winder on the street gives a first-rate chance to show what you've got to sell. I never did see no use in that winder before. My father, he had it cut for a kind of a whim like, and we all thought it was notional in him; but, as they say, keep a thing long enough and a use'll turn up. It's a sort of a gain for you, too, having the house so old-fashioned. Folks has a hankering for such things, nowadays--the Lord knows why. I hear 'em going on about it when I'm out tailorin', calling ugly things 'quaint,' and lovely, because they're old. Hetty,\"--with sudden inspiration,--\"here's an idea for you, be 'quaint'! Don't try for a shop, keep the room a room, and make it as old-fashioned-looking as you can, and I'll bet a cookie that your gingerbread'll be twice as popular with one set of folks, and if it's first-rate gingerbread, the other set who don't care for old things will like it just as well.\"  What a bracing thing is a word in season! Aunt Polly's little seed of suggestion grew and spread like Jack's fabled bean-stalk.  \"Your light biscuits always turn out well,\" said Delia.  \"And my snaps. Grandmother liked them so much. And you're a good hand at loaf bread, you know. Aunt Polly--I seem to smell a fortune in the air. We will begin at once, just as soon as I can get a half-barrel of flour and put an advertisement in the paper.\"  Hetty had a ready wit, and Aunt Polly's hint as to \"quaintness\" was not lost upon her. The advertisement when it appeared the next day but one ran thus:--  \"After Monday next, the Old-Time Bakery, corner of Farewell and Martin Streets, will be prepared to furnish, to order, fresh bread, buns, biscuits, and grandmother's gingerbread, all home-made.\"  People smiled over the little notice, but the odd wording stuck in their memories as odd things will, and more than one person went out of his way during the next week to take a look into the wide, low window, within which, on a broad, napkin-covered shelf, stood rows of biscuits, light and white, buns, each glazed with shining umber-brown, and loaves of gingerbread whose complexion and smell were enough to vouch for their excellence. Acting on Aunt Polly's suggestion, Hetty had set forth her wares on plates of the oldest and oddest pattern which could be found in grandmother's closet. A queer, tall pitcher flanked them on either side, and round the window-frame she had twined the long, luxuriant shoots of a potted ivy. Altogether the effect was pretty, and no one need be told that the pitchers had for years been consecrated to the reception of yeast and corks, or that the plates had long since been relegated to kitchen use as too shabby for better occasions.  \"Hain't ye no white chany?\" inquired their first customer, an old woman, as she slowly counted out the pennies for half a dozen biscuit. \"It would kind of set your cakes off.\"  \"We used what we had,\" replied Hetty, diplomatically. \"But I hope your biscuits'll taste just as good as if they came off a white plate.\"  This old woman, two others, and a little boy were the only customers that first day.  \"'Tisn't a bit a good beginning,\" declared Delia, pouring the money received out of an old-fashioned china tea-caddy which Hetty had unearthed in an up-stairs closet and brought down to serve as a till. \"Two dozen biscuits, that's twenty-four cents, a loaf of gingerbread, and about half the buns. That's fifty-three cents in all. What did you say the materials cost?\"  \"About seventy cents. But then we have our supper and breakfast out of them, and nearly half the stock to sell at a reduced rate to-morrow. We shan't lose anything, I reckon, but we shan't gain much either.\"  \"Rome wasn't built all in a minute. You'll do yet,\" remarked Aunt Polly, who had dropped in to hear the result of the first day's sales.  But two days--three--a week, went by, and still trade did not materially improve, and it took all Aunt Polly's wise saws and hopeful auguries to keep their spirits up. Each day showed the same record, no loss, but almost no gain. Toward the end of the second week matters mended. Mrs. Corliss, the wife of a wealthy manufacturer, having an errand in Farewell Street, happened to pass the little window, and her bric-a-brac-loving eyes were caught at once by its unusual appearance. She stopped, studied the whole arrangement from the ivy wreath to the old pitchers; a recollection of the droll little advertisement over which she had laughed a few days previously, came over her. \"I declare, this is the very place,\" she said to herself; and opening the door she entered, precisely as Hetty came from the kitchen through the opposite door, a handkerchief tied over her shiny hair, a white apron with a little ruffled waist protecting her print gown, her cheeks flushed rosy pink with heat, and in her hands a tray full of crisp, delectably smelling ginger-snaps.  \"A real study--like a Flemish picture,\" Mrs. Corliss said afterward. She fell in love at once with the quaint room, the pretty sisters, the old china, stayed twenty minutes nibbling ginger-snaps and looking about her, bought a dollar's worth of everything, \"on trial,\" as she said, and swept out, leaving a wake of rose-colored hope in the air--and Delia and Hetty executing a wild waltz behind her back, for joy and gratulation.  \"Luck has turned--I know, I feel it,\" declared Hetty.  Luck _had_ turned. Mrs. Corliss raved to everybody she knew about the room, the twin-sisters, and the excellence of the gingerbread. It became a fashion to go to Farewell Street for buns and biscuits. Hetty and Delia had to work early and late to fill their orders, but what was that \"to sewing their fingers off for a bare living\"? Hetty said; and toil was sweetened now by a gradually increasing profit. At the end of the first six months they had not only \"lived and kept together,\" but had a little sum laid by, which, as Aunt Polly advised, was treated as \"business capital,\" part of it being invested in the purchase of an awning for the window and an extra stove to increase their baking capacity. Very rarely were there any stale things left now to be sold next day at half-price, the regular orders and chance custom consuming all.  \"We shall have to hire a boy to carry things round, I actually believe,\" declared Hetty. \"Mrs. Malcomb and Mrs. Sayres both said that they would order our bread regularly if we could send it home.\"  \"I've been expecting that would be the next step,\" remarked Aunt Polly, \"and I guess I've got just the boy you want, in my eye. It's Widow McCullen's lad--Sandy, as they call him. He's a good little chap, and it'll be a real help to his mother to have him earning a trifle.\"  So Sandy McCullen was regularly engaged as \"bread-boy,\" and business grew brisker still.  \"Aunt Polly, we've got to another notch,\" said Hetty, at the end of the first year. \"You don't happen to know of a girl, do you, who could help us in the baking? Delia and I can't keep up with the orders. She gets so tired every now and then that she can't sleep, and that worries me so that I lie awake, too.\"  \"That'll never answer; no, I don't know of any girl, but there's a nice kind of an oldish woman, if she'll do, that I'd like to recommend. Yes--I mean myself,\" she went on, chuckling at Hetty's amazed look. \"It's come to me more than once lately that it'd be sort of good and restful to make a change, and not go on tailorin' forever, all the rest of my days. I used to be a master hand at bread and pie-crust, too, when I was your age, and I've a little saved up which can go with the business if it's needed; and, if you girls say so, we'll just make a kind of family firm of the thing. How does it strike you?\"  \"Oh, Aunt Polly, the very thing, only it seems too good to be true. Do you really mean it? We did so hate the idea of a raw girl to whom we should have to teach everything, and who would spoil half she made for the first month, and I've fought it off as long as I could. Why, it will be like having grandmother come back, to have you living with us. There's the west room all ready. Dear me! How delightfully things seem to turn out for us always!\"  \"That wasn't your view always, it seems to me,\" rejoined Aunt Polly. \"A year ago you was pretty down in the mouth, if I don't mistake. Gingerbread is good for something, you see.\"  \"The Old-Time Bakery\" still goes on in Farewell Street, but it has grown far beyond its original proportions. If you were to visit it to-day you would find a room double the size of the former, and which has been made by taking down a partition wall between the sitting-room and a spare bedroom and throwing them into one. There are two windows on the street now, one full of bread, biscuits, and buns, the other stored with Hetty's now famous gingerbread, and with delicious-looking pumpkin-pies and apple-tarts with old-fashioned flaky crust, which are Aunt Polly's specialty and have added greatly to the reputation of the establishment. Still it is not a shop. Hetty, with wary good taste, has scrupulously preserved the \"quaint\" look which first gave character to the little enterprise, and by judicious rummaging in neighbors' garrets has acquired sundry old-time chairs, bottles, jugs, and platters, which help in the effect. Everything is scrupulously clean and bright, as all things must be where Aunt Polly supervises; but the brightest things in the room are the faces of the twin sisters. They have tested and proved their powers; they know now what they can do, and they taste the happiness of success.  I tell their little story, in which is nothing remarkable or out of the way, for the sake of other girls, who, perhaps, are sitting to-day with folded hands and puzzling and wondering, just as Hetty and Delia did, over what they are to do and how to set about it. I do not mean at all that these girls should all make gingerbread--that indeed would be \"overstocking the market,\" as Aunt Polly would say, but only that they should hearken to her word of wisdom, \"find out what they can do _best_, and do that,\" whatever it is, secure that good work, and hearty striving will win some measure of success soon or late, even if its beginnings are small and insignificant as a gingerbread loaf or a batch of biscuit!     THE SECRET DOOR.   KNOWLE, in Kent, is an ancient manor-house. It stands knee-deep in rich garden and pasture lands, with hay-fields and apple-orchards stretching beyond, and solemn oak woods which whisper and shake their wise heads when the wind blows, as though possessed of secrets which must not be spoken.  Very much as it looks to-day, it looked two hundred and thirty years ago, when Charles the First was king of England. That was the Charles who had his head cut off, you may remember. Blue Christmas smokes curled from the twisted chimneys in 1645, just as they will this year if the world lasts so long as December. The same dinnery fragrance filled the air, for good cheer smells pretty much alike in all ages and the world over. A few changes there may be--thicker trees, beds of gay flowers which were not known in that day; and where once the moat--a ditch-like stream of green water covered with weeds and scum--ran round the walls, is now a trimly cut border of verdant turf. But these changes are improvements, and in all important respects the house keeps its old look, undisturbed by modern times and ways.  In the same nursery where modern boys and girls eat, sleep, and learn their A, B, C to-day, two children lived,--little Ralph Tresham and his sister Henrietta. Quaint, old-fashioned creatures they would look to us now; but, in spite of their formal dresses and speech, they were bright and merry and happy as any children you can find among your acquaintances. Ralph's name was pronounced \"Rafe,\" and he always called his sister \"Hexie.\"  Christmas did not come to Knowle in its usual bright shape in 1645. Gloom and sadness and anxiety overshadowed the house; and though the little ones did not understand what the cause of the anxiety was, they felt something wrong, and went about quietly whispering to each other in corners, instead of whooping and laughing, as had been their wont. They had eaten their Christmas beef, and toasted the king in a thimbleful of wine, as usual, but their mother cried when they did so; and Joyce, the old butler, had carried off the pudding with a face like a funeral. So after dinner they crept away to the nursery, and there, by the window, began a long whispering talk. Hexie had something very exciting to tell.  \"Nurse thought I was asleep,\" she said, \"but I wasn't quite; and when they began to talk I woke up. That wasn't wrong, was it, Rafe? I couldn't sleep when I couldn't, could I?\"  \"I suppose not; but you needn't have listened,\" said Rafe, whose notions about honor were very strict.  \"I did pull the pillow over my ear, but the words would get in,\" went on Henrietta, piteously. \"And it was so interesting. Did you know that there were such creatures as Bogies, Rafe? Dorothy thinks we have got one in our house, and that its hole is in the great gallery, because once when she was there dusting the armor, she heard a queer noise in the wall, and what else could it be? It eats a great deal, does the Bogie. That's the reason nurse is sure we have got one. It ate all the cold sheep's-head yesterday, and the day before half the big pasty. No victual is safe in the larder, the Bogie has such a big appetite, nurse says.\"  \"I remember about the sheep's-head,\" said Rafe, meditatively. \"Almost all of it was left, and I looked to see it come in cold; but when I asked, Joyce said there was none. Cold sheep's-head is very good. Do you remember how much Humphrey used to like it?\"  \"I don't remember exactly, it is so long ago,\" replied Hexie. \"How long is it, brother?--since Humphrey went away, I mean. Won't he ever come back?\"  \"I asked Winifred once, but she only said, 'God knew,' that nothing had been heard of him since the battle when the king was taken. He might be dead, or he might be escaped into foreign parts--and then she cried, oh, so hard, Hexie! Poor Humphrey! I hope he isn't dead. But, about the Bogie, how curious it must be to meet one! Oh, I say, let us go to the gallery now, and listen if we can hear any strange noises there. Will you?\"  \"Oh, Rafe! I'm afraid. I don't quite like--\"  \"But you can't be afraid if I'm there,\" said Rafe, valiantly; \"besides, I'll put on Humphrey's old sword which he left behind. Then if the Bogie comes--we shall see!\"  Rafe spoke like a conquering hero, Hexie thought; so, though she trembled, she made no further objection, but stood by while he lifted down the sword, helped to fasten its belt over his shoulder, and followed along the passage which led to the gallery. The heavy sword clattered and rattled as it dragged on the floor, and the sound was echoed in a ghostly way, which renewed Hexie's fears.  \"Rafe! Rafe! let us go back,\" she cried.  \"Go back yourself if you are afraid,\" replied Ralph, stoutly; and as going back alone through the dim passage seemed just then worse than staying where she was, Hexie stayed with her valiant brother.  Very softly they unlatched the gallery door, and stole in. It was a long, lofty apartment, panelled with cedar-wood, to which time had given a beautiful light brown color. The ceiling, of the same wood, was carved, here and there, with shields, coats of arms, and other devices. There was little furniture: one tall cabinet, a few high-backed Dutch chairs, and some portraits hanging on the walls. The sun, not yet quite set, poured a stream of red light across the polished floor, leaving the far corners and the empty spaces formidably dusk. The children had seldom been in the gallery at this hour, and it looked to them almost like a strange place, not at all as it did at noonday when they came to jump up and down the slippery floor, and play hide-and-seek in the comers which now seemed so dark and dismal.  Even Rafe felt the difference, and shivered in spite of his bold heart and the big sword by his side. Timidly they went forward, hushing their footsteps and peering furtively into the shadows. Suddenly Hexie stopped with a little scream.  [Illustration: Close by the armor, half hidden by a curtain of heavy tapestry, was an open door.--PAGE 142.]  Close to them stood a huge suit of armor, larger and taller than a man. The empty eye-holes of the helmet glared out quite like real eyes, and the whole figure was terrible enough to frighten any little girl. But it was not at the armor that Hexie screamed; the iron man was an old friend of the children's. Many a game of hide-and-seek had they played around, and behind, and even inside him; for Humphrey had contrived a cunning way by which the figure could be taken to pieces and put together again; and more than once Rafe had been popped inside, and had lain shaking with laughter while Hexie vainly searched for him through all the gallery. This had not happened lately, for Rafe was hardly strong enough to manage by himself the screws and hinges which opened the armor; but he knew the iron man too well to scream at him, and so did Hexie. The object which excited her terror was something different, and so strange and surprising that it is no wonder she screamed.  Close by the armor, half hidden by a curtain of heavy tapestry, was an open door, where never door had been known to be. It stood ajar, and dimly visible inside was a narrow staircase winding upward.  \"The hole of the Bogie!\" gasped Hexie, clutching at Rafe's arm. He started, and felt for the sword. It rattled fearfully, and the sound completed Hexie's terror. She burst away, flew like a scared lapwing down the gallery, along the passages, and never stopped till she reached the nursery and her own bed, where, with two pillows and the quilt drawn over her head, she lay sobbing bitterly at the thought of Ralph left behind, to be eaten perhaps by the Bogie! Poor little Hexie!  Ralph, meanwhile, stood his ground. His heart beat very fast, but he would not run away,--that was for girls. It must be owned, however, that when a moment later the sound of muffled voices became audible down the stairs, he trembled extremely, and was guilty of the unmanlike act of hiding behind the curtain. He was only ten years old, which must plead his excuse with bigger boys who are confident that they could never, under any circumstances, hide themselves or be afraid.  The voices drew nearer, steps sounded, and two figures came out of the narrow doorway. Could there be two Bogies? No wonder they ate so much. But in another minute all thought of Bogies vanished from Ralph's mind, for in one of the figures he recognized his own sister Winifred.  Her companion was a man. There was something familiar in his form. It moved forward, and Ralph jumped so that the big sword rattled again. Bogie number two was his brother Humphrey, mourned as dead ever since the summer before, when so many brave gentlemen gave up their lives for King Charles at the battle of Naseby.  \"What noise was that?\" whispered Winifred, fearfully.  \"Some sound from below,\" replied Humphrey, after listening a moment. \"Must you go, Winnie?\"  \"I must, dear Humphrey. I dare not absent myself longer lest I be missed and suspected. Oh, if to-morrow were but over, and you safe on the French lugger and over the sea! I cannot breathe while this hiding and danger go on.\"  \"I suppose I ought to be glad also,\" said Humphrey, ruefully; \"but to me that French lugger means exile, and loneliness, and poverty, for the rest of my life, perhaps. Better have laid down my life with the rest at Naseby, in striking one last blow for the king.\"  \"Don't, don't speak so!\" protested Winifred, tearfully. \"You are alive, thank God; and once these wars are over we may rejoin you, and have a happy home somewhere, if not in the land of our fathers. Now, dear Humphrey, have you all you need for the night?\"  \"Christmas cheer,\" said Humphrey, in a would-be cheerful voice. \"Beef and ale,--what better fare could be? You are a gallant provider, my Winnie, and there is need, for since I have lain in that hole with nothing else to do, my appetite has raged like a wolf. That sheep's-head was wondrous savory. I say though, Winnie, what do the servants think of the famine I create in the larder?\"  \"Oh, the stupid things fancy that a Bogie has taken up his residence here. A very hungry Bogie, Joyce calls the creature!\"  The brother and sister laughed; then they kissed each other.  \"Good-night, dearest Winifred.\"  \"Good-night, brother.\" And Humphrey vanished up the stairs. Winifred lingered a moment; then, as if remembering something, opened the door again and ran after him. Ralph marked that she laid her hand on a particular boss in the carved wainscot, and pressed it in hard, whereon the door sprang open. He stole out, laid his hand on the same boss, and felt the spring give way under his touch. Some undefined idea of stealing in later, to make Humphrey a visit, was in his head; but he heard Winifred returning, and hurried out of the gallery. Putting back the sword in its place, he entered the nursery. No Hexie was visible, but a sobbing sound drew his attention to a tumbled heap on the bed.  \"Is that you, Hexie? Why, what are you crying about?\" pulling away the pillow, which she held tight.  \"Oh, Rafe! Then the Bogie didn't eat you, after all!\" And Hexie buried her tear-stained face in his shoulder.  \"Bogie! Nonsense! There are no such things as Bogies!\"  \"What was it, then, that lived up that dreadful stairs?\"  \"I can't tell you; only it was nothing at all dreadful. And, Hexie, don't say a word about that door to any one, will you? It might make great trouble if you did.\"  \"I did tell Deborah, when she fetched the candle and asked why I cried, that I saw a strange door in the gallery,\" faltered Hexie, truthful, though penitent.  \"Oh! Hexie, how could you? I don't like Deborah, and her father is a crop-eared knave. Humphrey said so one day. How could you talk to her about the door, Hexie?\"  \"I--don't know. I was frightened, and she asked me,\" sobbed Hexie. \"Will it do any harm, Rafe?\"  \"It may,\" said Rafe, gloomily. \"But don't cry, Hexie. You meant no harm, at all events.\"  \"Oh, don't speak so gravely and so like Joyce,\" said Hexie, much troubled. She cried herself to sleep that night. Deborah, who undressed her, asked many questions about the gallery and the door.  \"It was very dark, and perhaps I mistook,\"--that was all Hexie could be made to say. Ralph was disturbed and wakeful, and slept later than usual next morning. He jumped up in a hurry and made what haste he could with dressing and breakfast, but it seemed as though they never took so much time before; and all the while he ate he was conscious of a stir and bustle in the house, which excited his curiosity very much. Knocking--the sound of feet--something unusual was going on.  As soon as possible he slipped away from nurse and ran to the gallery. The door was half open. He looked in, and stood still with terror. Men in brown uniforms and steel caps were there sounding the walls and tapping the floor-boards with staves. The gallery seemed full of them, though when Rafe counted there were but five.  \"This man of iron was, in all likelihood, a Malignant also,\" he heard one of them say, striking the armor with his fist.  \"He is somewhat old for that. Methinks that is armor of the time of that man of blood, Harry the Eighth. Move it aside, Jotham, that we may search the farther panel.\"  So the heavy figure was thrust into a corner, and the men went on tapping with their wands. Rafe groaned within himself when he heard them declare that the wall sounded hollow, and saw them searching for a spring. Twenty times it seemed as though they must have lighted on the right place. Twenty times they just missed it.  \"We were ill advised to come without tools,\" declared the man who seemed leader of the party. \"Come thou to my shop, Peter Kettle, and thou, Bartimeus and Zerubbabel, and we will fetch such things as are needful. Jotham, stay thou here, to see that no man escapeth from the concealment behind the wall.\"  So four of the men went away, leaving Jotham striding up and down as on guard. Presently came a shout from beneath the window,--  \"Jotham! our leader hath dropped his pouch in which are the keys of the smithy. Hasten and bring it to the outer door.\"  \"Aye, aye!\" answered Jotham, and, pouch in hand, he ran down the stairs. Now was Rafe's opportunity. Like a flash he was across the gallery, his hand on the boss. The door flew open, and he fell into the arms of Humphrey, who, sword in hand and teeth set, stood on the lower step of the staircase, prepared to sell his liberty as dearly as possible.  \"Rafe! little Rafe!\" he exclaimed.  \"Hush! The man will come back,\" panted Rafe. \"Come away--hide--oh, where?\" Then with a sudden inspiration he dragged his brother toward the iron man. \"Get inside,\" he cried. \"They will never think of searching there! Oh, Humphrey--make haste! Get inside!\"  There was no time to be lost. With the speed of desperation, Humphrey unscrewed, lifted, stepped inside the armor. Rafe slipped the fastenings together, whispered \"Shut your eyes,\" and flew back to his hiding-place. Just in time, for Jotham's step was on the stair, and next moment he entered the gallery, and resumed his march up and down, little dreaming that the man sought for was peeping through the helmet holes at him, not three feet away.  Presently the other soldiers came back with hammers and wrenches, and in a short time the beautiful wainscot, split into pieces, lay on the floor. Suddenly there was a shout. The secret door had flown open, and the staircase stood revealed. Four of the men, with pikes and pistols, prepared to ascend, while the fifth guarded the opening below.  At that moment Winifred entered the gallery from the farther end. She turned deadly pale when she saw the open door and the men.  \"Oh! Heaven have mercy!\" she cried, and dropped half fainting into a chair.  Rafe darted across the floor and seized her hand.  \"Hush,\" he whispered. \"Don't say a word, sister. _He_ is safe.\"  \"He? Who?\" cried the amazed Winifred.  But now voices sounded from above. The men were coming down. Winifred rallied her courage, rose, and went forward. She was very white still, but she spoke in a steady voice. Her two brothers, Humphrey in his hiding-place and little Rafe by her side, both admired her greatly.  \"What is the meaning of this, Jotham Green?\" she demanded. \"By what warrant do you enter and spoil our house?\"  \"By the warrant which all true men have to search for traitors,\" said Jotham.  \"You will find none such here,\" responded Winifred, firmly.  \"We find the lurking-place in which one such has doubtless lain,\" said Zerubbabel. \"Where holes exist, look out for vermin.\"  \"You are less than civil, neighbor. An old house like this has many strange nooks and corners of which the inhabitants may have neither use nor knowledge. If your search is done, I will beg you to make good the damage you have caused as best you may, and with as little noise as possible, that my mother be not alarmed. Jotham Green, you are a good workman, I know. I recollect how deftly you once repaired that cabinet for us.\"  All the men knew Winifred, and her calm and decided manner made its impression. Jotham slowly picked up the fragments of the panelling and began to fit them together. The rest consulted, and at last rather sheepishly, and with a muttered half apology about \"wrong information,\" went away, taking with them the injured woodwork, which Jotham undertook to repair. Rafe's first words after they disappeared were,--  \"Winifred, you must dismiss Deborah. It is she that has betrayed us.\"  \"How do you know that, Rafe?\"  Then it all came out. Winifred listened to the tale with streaming tears.  \"Oh, Rafe, my darling, how brave you were! You played the man for us to-day, and have saved--I trust you have saved--our Humphrey. The men will not return to-day, and to-night the lugger sails.\"  And Humphrey was saved. Before morning, well disguised, he had made his way across country to a little fishing-port, embarked, and reached France without further accident.  So that strange Christmas adventure ended happily. It was all long, long ago. Humphrey and Winifred and Rafe lived their lives out, and lay down to rest a century and a half since under the daisy-sprinkled English sod. Little Hexie died an aged woman, before any of us was born. But still the beautiful old manor-house stands amid its gardens and pasture lands, with the silvery look of time on its gray walls. Still the armed figure keeps guard beside the secret staircase, the tapestry hangs in the old heavy folds, evening reddens the cedar walls and the polished floor, and everything occupies the same place and wears the same look that it did when little Rafe played the man in that gallery, and saved his brother Humphrey, more than two hundred years ago.     THE TWO WISHES.   PIEROT and Pierotte were a small brother and sister who were always wishing to be something that they were not, or to have something which they had not. They were not unhappy or discontented children,--far from it. Their home, though poor, was comfortable; their parents, though strict, were kind: they were used to both, and desired nothing better. Wishing with them was a habit, an idle game which they were forever playing. It meant little, but it sounded ill; and a stranger, listening, would have judged them less well-off and cheerful than they really were.  \"I wish I needn't wake up, but might lie still all day,\" was Pierotte's first thought every morning; while Pierot's was, \"I wish Pierotte wasn't such a sleepy-head, for then we could get out before sunrise, and gather every mushroom in the meadow while the Blaize children are still snoring in their beds.\" Then later, at breakfast, Pierotte would say, \"I wish I were the Princess, to have coffee and white bread for my _djeuner_, instead of tiresome porridge. I am tired of porridge. White bread and coffee must be better,--much better!\" But all the time she spoke, Pierotte's spoon, travelling between her bowl and mouth, conveyed the \"tiresome\" porridge down her throat as rapidly as though it were the finest Mocha; and Pierotte enjoyed it as much, though she fancied that she did not.  \"I wish I were the young Comte Jules,\" Pierot would next begin in his turn. \"No fagots to bind, no cow to fodder, no sheep to tend. Ah! a fine life he leads! Beautiful clothes, nothing to do. Six meals a day, two of them dinners, a horse to ride,--everything! I wish--\"  \"And a nice yellow skin and eyes like boiled gooseberries,\" chimed in his mother. \"Better wish for these while you are about it. Much you know of noblemen and their ways! Didst ever have an indigestion? Tell me that. When thou hast tried one, wish for it again, if thou canst.\"  Then Pierot would laugh sheepishly, shoulder his hatchet, and go off after wood, the inseparable Pierotte trotting by his side. As they went, it would be,--  \"I wish I were a bird,\" or \"I wish we could jump like that grasshopper;\" or, \"Pierotte, I wish our godfather had left us his money. We should be rich then.\"  For the children had the same godfather. Pierotte first, and then Pierot having been named after their father's cousin, a well-to-do peasant, who it was expected would remember his little relatives in his will. This hope had been disappointed, and the children's regrets were natural and excusable, since even the wise dame, their mother, did not conceal her opinion of Cousin Pierre's conduct, which she considered irregular and dishonest. Children soon learn to join in chorus with older voices, and Pierot and Pierotte, in this case, found it particularly easy, as it chimed with the habit of their lives.  One warm July morning their mother roused them for an early breakfast, and sent them into the forest after wood.  \"My last fagot is in,\" she said. \"You must bind and tie smartly to-day. And, Pierotte, help thy brother all that thou canst, for the father cannot spare him to go again this week, and on Saturday is the sennight's baking.\"  So they set forth. The sun was not fairly risen, but his light went before his coming, and even in the dim forest-paths it was easy to distinguish leaf from flower. Shadows fell across the way from the trees, which stood so motionless that they seemed still asleep. Heavy dew hung on the branches; the air was full of a rare perfume, made up of many different fragrances, mixed and blended by the cunning fingers of the night. A little later, and the light broadened. Rays of sun filtered through the boughs, a wind stirred, and the trees roused themselves, each with a little shake and quiver. Somehow, the forest looked unfamiliar, and like a new place to the children that morning. They were not often there at so early an hour, it is true, but this did not quite account for the strange aspect of the woods. Neither of them knew, or, if they knew, they had forgotten, that it was Midsummer's Day, the fairies' special festival. Nothing met their eyes, no whir of wings or sparkle of bright faces from under the fern-branches, but a sense of something unusual was in the air, and the little brother and sister walked along in silence, peering curiously this way and that, with an instinctive expectation of unseen wonders.  \"Isn't it lovely?\" whispered Pierotte, at last. \"It never looked so pretty here as it does to-day. See that wild-rose,--how many flowers it has! Oh! what was that? It waved at me!\"  \"What waved?\"  \"The rose. It waved a white arm at me!\"  \"Nonsense! It was the wind,\" replied Pierot, sturdily, leading the way into a side-path which led off from the rose-bush.  \"Is it much farther where we get the wood?\" asked Pierotte, for the children had been walking a considerable time.  \"Father said we were to go to the hazel copse,\" answered Pierot. \"We must be almost there.\"  So for half an hour longer they went on and on, but still no sign of fallen trees or wood-choppers appeared, and Pierot was forced to confess that he must have mistaken the road.  \"It is queer, too,\" he said. \"There was that big red toadstool where the paths joined. I noticed it the other day when I came with the father. What's the matter?\" for Pierotte had given a sudden jump.  \"Some one laughed,\" said Pierotte, in an awe-struck tone.  \"It was a cricket or tree-toad. Who is here to laugh?\"  Pierotte tried hard to believe him, but she did not feel comfortable, and held Pierot's sleeve tight as they went. He felt the trembling of the little hand.  \"Pierotte, thou art a goose!\" he said; but all the same he put his arm round her shoulders, which comforted her so that she walked less timorously.  One path after another they tried, but none of them led to the cleared spot where the fallen trees lay. The sun rose high, and the day grew warmer, but in the forest a soft breeze blew, and kept them cool. Hour after hour passed; the children had walked till they were tired. They rested awhile, ate half their dinner of curds and black bread, then they went on again, turned, twisted, tried paths to right and paths to left, but still the dense woods closed them in, and they had no idea where they were or how they should go.  Suddenly the track they were following led to a little clearing, in which stood a tiny hut, with a fenced garden full of cherry-trees and roses. It was such a surprise to find this fertile and blooming spot in the heart of the wild wood, that the children stood still with their mouths open, to stare at it.  \"How strange!\" gasped Pierot, when at last he found his voice. \"The father always said that ours was the only hut till you got to the other side the forest.\"  \"Perhaps this _is_ the other side,\" suggested Pierotte.  An odd chuckling laugh followed this remark, and they became aware of an old woman sitting at the window of the cottage,--a comical old woman, with a stiff square cap on her head, sharp twinkling eyes, and a long hooked nose. As the children looked, she laughed again, and, extending her finger, beckoned them to come nearer.  Timidly they obeyed, setting down their big wood-basket at the gate. The old woman leaned over the window to await them, her hand on a square glass jar full of yellow liquid, in which floated what seemed to be a pickled serpent with his tail in three coils, and the tip in his mouth. Pierotte shuddered at the serpent, but Pierot was bolder.  \"Did you want us, good madam?\" he asked.  \"Want you? No,\" replied the \"good madam.\" \"How should I want you? I saw you staring at my house as if your eyes would pop out of your heads, and I thought, perhaps, you wanted me.\"  \"It was only--we were only--surprised,\" stammered Pierot. \"Because we didn't know that there was a house here.\"  \"There was none last night, and there won't be any to-morrow morning--at least--none for children to stare at,\" replied the old woman, coolly.  \"What _do_ you mean?\" cried Pierot, astonished beyond measure. \"How can a house be built in one night? And why won't it be here to-morrow?\"  \"Because to-morrow won't be Midsummer's Day--and to-day is,\" replied the old woman; \"and a fairy-house is visible to mortal eyes at that time, and no other.\"  \"Fairy-house!\" faltered Pierot; while Pierotte, jumping more rapidly to a conclusion, fairly screamed: \"Oh, Pierot! Madam, then, is a fairy! A real fairy! Pierot, think of it, only think of it!\"  \"Very much at your service,\" said the old woman, with a malicious smile. \"Do you like fairies, then? Do you admire my pickled snake? Would you wish to pull some flowers?\"  Something in the smile made Pierotte draw back; but Pierot said politely,--  \"One rose, perhaps--since Madam is so good.\"  The fairy leaned out and plucked a rose from the vine which grew on the wall close by.  \"Now listen,\" she said. \"Each of my roses encloses a wish. You are great wishers, I know;\" and her eyes twinkled queerly. \"This time the wish will come true, so take care what you are about. There will be no coming to get me to undo the wish, for I shan't be visible again till this time next year on Midsummer's Day,--you know.\"  \"Oh, Pierot! what shall we wish for?\" cried Pierotte, much excited; but the old woman only repeated, \"Take care!\" drew her head in at the window, and all in a minute--how, they could not explain--the cottage had vanished, the garden, the gate,--they were in the wood again, with nothing but trees and bushes about them; and all would have seemed like a dream, except for the red and fragrant rose which Pierot held in his hand.  \"What shall we wish for?\" repeated Pierotte, as they seated themselves under a tree to talk over this marvellous adventure.  \"We must be very careful, and ask for something nice,\" replied Pierot.  \"It would be better to wait and think for a long time first,\" suggested Pierotte.  \"Thou art right. We will. Art thou not hungry?\"  \"Oh, so hungry! Let us eat the rest of our bread now. I can't wait any longer.\"  So Pierot produced the big lump of bread, and divided it into two equal portions.  \"Look, look!\" cried Pierotte, as her teeth met in the first mouthful. \"A cherry-tree, brother,--a real cherry-tree here in the woods! And with ripe cherries on it! How good some would be with our bread!\"  \"First-rate!\" cried Pierot; and, putting their bread carefully on the grass, both ran to the tree. Alas! the boughs grew high, and the cherries hung far beyond their reach. Pierot tried to climb the tree, but the stem was both slight and slippery. Then they found a forked stick, but vainly attempted to hook and draw down a branch.  \"Oh, dear! I wish we were both grown up,\" cried Pierot, panting with exertion.  \"So do I. If we were as old as father and mother, we could reach the boughs without even getting on tiptoe,\" chimed in Pierotte.  Luckless words! As Pierot spoke, the rose, which he had stuck in his cap, shrivelled and faded, while a queer sensation as if he were being carried up into the air swept over him. He clutched at something to hold himself down. That something was the cherry-tree bough! He could reach it now, and as his eyes turned with dismay toward Pierotte, there she stood, also holding a twig of the tree, only two or three inches lower than his own. Her pretty round cheeks and childish curls were gone, and instead of them he beheld a middle-aged countenance with dull hair, a red nose, and a mouth fallen in for lack of teeth. She, on her part, unconscious of the change, was staring at him with a horrified expression.  \"Why, Pierot!\" she cried at last, in a voice which sounded as old as her face, \"how queer you look! You've got a beard, and your forehead is all criss-cross and wrinkly, and your chin rough. Dear me, how ugly you are! I never thought you could be so ugly.\"  \"Ugly, eh! Perhaps you would like to see your own face,\" said Pierot, enraged at this flattering criticism. \"Just wait till we get home, and I show you the old looking-glass. But stay, we needn't wait;\" and he dragged Pierotte to the side of a little pool of still water, which had caught his eye among the bushes. \"Here's a looking-glass ready made,\" he went on. \"Look, Pierotte, and see what a beauty you have become.\"  Poor Pierotte! She took one look, gave a scream, and covered her face with her hands.  \"That me?\" she cried. \"Oh! I never, never will think it! What is the matter with us, Pierot? Was it that horrid fairy, do you think? Did she bewitch us?\"  \"The wish!\" faltered Pierot, who at that moment caught sight of the faded rose in his cap. \"I wished that we were both grown up, don't you remember? Oh, what a fool I was!\"  \"You horrid boy! You have gone and wished me into an ugly old woman! I'll never forgive you!\" sobbed Pierotte.  \"It was your wish too. You said you would like to be as old as father and mother. So you needn't call me horrid!\" answered Pierot, angrily.  Silence followed, broken only by Pierotte's sobs. The two old children sat with their backs to each other, under different trees. By and by Pierot's heart began to smite him.  \"It was more my fault than hers,\" he thought; and, turning round a little way, he said coaxingly, \"Pierotte.\"  No answer. Pierotte only stuck out her shoulder a little and remained silent.  \"Don't look so cross,\" went on Pierot. \"You can't think how horrid it makes you--a woman of your age!\"  \"I'm not a woman of my age. Oh, how can you say such things?\" sobbed Pierotte. \"I don't want to be grown-up. I want to be a little girl again.\"  \"You used to be always wishing you were big,\" remarked her now big brother.  \"Y--es, so I was; but I never meant all at once. I wanted to be big enough to spin--and the--mother--was--going--to teach me,\" went on poor Pierotte, crying bitterly, \"and I wanted to be as big as Laura Blaize--and--pretty--and some day have a sweetheart, as she had--and--but what's the use--I've lost it all, and I'm grown up, and old and ugly already, and the mother won't know me, and the father will say, 'My little Pierotte--Coeur de St. Martin--impossible! get out, you witch!'\" Overcome by this dreadful picture, Pierotte hid her face and cried louder than ever.  \"I'll tell you what,\" said Pierot, after a pause, \"don't let us go home at all. We will just hide here in the woods for a year, and when Midsummer's Day comes round, we'll hunt till we find the fairy house again, and beg the fairy, on our knees, for another wish, and if she says 'yes,' we'll wish at once to be little just as we were this morning, and _then_ we'll go home directly.\"  \"Poor mother; she will think we are dead!\" sighed Pierotte.  \"That's no worse than if she saw us like this. I'd be conscripted most likely and sent off to fight, and me only twelve years old! And you'd have a horrid time of it with the Blaize boys. Robert Blaize said you were the prettiest girl in Balne aux Bois. I wonder what he'd say now!\"  \"Oh, yes, let us stay here,\" shuddered Pierotte. \"I couldn't bear to see the Blaize boys now. But then--it will be dark soon--shan't you be frightened to stay in the woods all night?\"  \"Oh! a man like me isn't easily frightened,\" said Pierot, stoutly, but his teeth chattered a little.  \"It's so queer to hear you call yourself 'a man,'\" remarked Pierotte.  \"And it's just as queer to hear you call yourself a little girl,\" answered Pierot, with a glance at the antiquated face beside him.  \"Dear, how my legs shake, and how stiff my knees are!\" sighed Pierotte. \"Do grown-up people feel like that always?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Pierot, whose own legs lacked their old springiness. \"Would you like some cherries now, Pierotte? I can reach them easily.\"  \"Cherries! Those sour things? No, thank you. They would be sure to disagree with me,\" returned Pierotte, pettishly.  \"Times are changed,\" muttered Pierot; but he dared not speak aloud.  \"Where shall we sleep?\" asked Pierotte.  \"Under the trees, so long as the summer lasts.\"  \"Gracious! We shall both die of rheumatism.\"  \"Rheumatism? What an idea for a child like you!\"  \"I wish I _were_ a child,\" said Pierotte, with a groan. \"Here's a tree with grass below it, and I'm getting tired and sleepy.\"  When the brother and sister woke it was broad sunlight again.  \"One day gone of our year,\" said Pierot, trying to be cheerful.  It was hard work as time went on, and with all their constant walking and wandering they never seemed to find their way out of the forest, or of that particular part of it where their luckless adventure had befallen them. Turn which way they would, the paths always appeared to lead them round to the same spot; it was like bewitchment; they could make nothing out of it. The dulness of their lives was varied only by an occasional quarrel. Pierot would essay to climb a tree, and Pierotte, grown sage and proper, would upbraid him for behaving so foolishly,--\"just like a boy,\"--or he would catch her using the pool as a mirror, and would tease her for caring so much for a plain old face when there was nobody but himself to look. How the time went they had no idea. It seemed always daylight, and yet weeks, if not months, must have passed, they thought, and Pierot at last began to suspect the fairy of having changed the regular course of the sun so as to cheat them out of the proper time for finding her at home.  \"It's just like her,\" he said. \"She is making the days seem all alike, so that we may not know when Midsummer comes. Pierotte, I'll tell you what, we must be on the lookout, and search for the little house every day, for if we forget just once, that will be the very time, depend upon it.\"  So every day, and all day long, the two old children wandered to and fro in search of the fairy cot. For a long time their quest was in vain; but at last, one bright afternoon, just before sunset, as they were about giving up the hunt for that day, the woods opened in the same sudden way and revealed the garden, the hut, and--yes--at the window the pointed cap, the sharp black eyes. It was the fairy herself; they had found her at last.  For a moment they were too much bewildered to move; then side by side they hurried into the garden without waiting for invitation.  \"Well, my old gaffer, what can I do for you, or for you, dame?\" asked the fairy, benevolently.  \"Oh, please, I am not a dame, he is not a gaffer,\" cried Pierotte, imploringly. \"I am little Pierotte\"--and she bobbed a courtesy. \"And this is Pierot, my brother.\"  \"Pierot and Pierotte! Wonderful!\" said the fairy. \"But, my dear children, what has caused this change in your appearance? You have aged remarkably since I saw you last.\"  \"Indeed, we have,\" replied Pierot, with a grimace.  \"Well, age is a very respectable thing. Some persons are always wishing to be old,\" remarked the fairy, maliciously. \"You find it much pleasanter than being young, I dare say.\"  \"Indeed, we don't,\" said Pierotte, wiping her eyes on her apron.  \"No? Well, that is sad, but I _have_ heard people say the same before you.\"  \"Oh, please, please,\" cried Pierot and Pierotte, falling on their knees before the window, \"please, dear, kind fairy, forgive us. We don't like to be grown-up at all. We want to be little and young again. Please, dear fairy, turn us into children as we were before.\"  \"What would be the use?\" said the old woman. \"You'd begin wanting to be somebody else at once if you were turned back to what you were before.\"  \"We won't, indeed we won't,\" pleaded the children, very humbly.  The fairy leaned out and gathered a rose.  \"Very well,\" she said. \"Here's another wish for you. See that it is a wise one this time, for if you fail, it will be of no use to come to me.\"  With these words, she shut the blinds suddenly, and lo! in one second, house, garden, and all had vanished, and Pierot and Pierotte were in the forest again.  There was no deliberation this time as to what the wish should be.  \"I wish I was a little boy,\" shouted Pierot, holding the rose over his head with a sort of ecstasy.  \"And I wish I was a little girl, the same little girl exactly that I used to be,\" chorused Pierotte.  The rose seemed to melt in air, so quickly did it wither and collapse. And the brother and sister embraced and danced with joy, for each in the other's face saw the fulfilment of their double wish.  \"Oh, how young you look! Oh, how pretty you are! Oh, what happiness it is not to be old any longer! The dear fairy! The kind fairy!\" These were the exclamations which the squirrels and the birds heard for the next ten minutes, and the birds and the squirrels seemed to be amused, for certain queer and unexplained little noises like laughs sounded from under the leaves and behind the bushes.  \"Let us go home at once to mother,\" cried Pierotte.  There was no difficulty about the paths now. After walking awhile, Pierot began to recognize this turn and that. There was the huntsman's oak and the Dropping Well; and there--yes, he was sure--lay the hazel copse where the father had bidden them go for wood.  \"I say,\" cried Pierotte, with a sudden bright thought, \"we will wait and bind one fagot for the mother's oven--the poor mother! Who has fetched her wood all this time, do you suppose?\"  Plenty of sticks lay on the ground ready for binding. The wood-choppers had just left off their work, it would seem. Pierotte's basket was filled, a fagot tied and lifted on to Pierot's shoulders, and through the gathering twilight they hurried homeward. They were out of the wood soon. There was the hut, with a curl of smoke rising from the chimney; there was the mother standing at the door and looking toward the forest. What _would_ she say when she saw them?  What she said astonished them very much.  \"How long you have been!\" were the words, but the tone was not one of surprise.  \"O mother, mother!\" cried Pierotte, clinging to her arm, while Pierot said, \"We were afraid to come home because we looked so old, and we feared you would not know us, but now we are young again.\"  \"Old! young!\" said the mother. \"What does the lad mean! One does not age so fast between sunrise and sunset as to be afraid to come home. Are you dreaming, Pierot?\"  \"But we have been away a year,\" said Pierot, passing his hand before his eyes as if trying to clear his ideas.  \"A year! Prithee! And the sheets which I hung out at noon not fairly dry yet. A year! And the goats thou drovest to pasture before breakfast not in the shed yet! A year! Thou wouldst better not let the father hear thee prate thus! What, crying, Pierotte! Here's a pretty to-do because, forsooth, you are come in an hour late!\"  An hour late! The children looked at each other in speechless amazement. To this day the amazement continues. The mother still persists that they were absent but a few hours. Where, then, were the weeks spent in the wood, the gray hair, the wrinkles, the wanderings in search of the old woman and her hut? Was all and each but a bit of enchantment, a trick of the mirth-loving fairies? They could not tell, and neither can I. Fairies are unaccountable folk, and their doings surpass our guessing, who are but mortal, and stupid at that! One thing I know, that the two children since that day have dropped their foolish habit of wishing, and are well content to remain little Pierot and Pierotte till the time comes for them to grow older, as it will only too soon.     BLUE AND PINK.   TWO valentines lay together in the pillar post-box. One was pink and one was blue. Pink lay a-top, and they crackled to each other softly in the paper-language, invented long since by Papyrus, the father of Manuscript, and used by all written and printed sheets unto this day. Listen hard, next time you visit the reading-room at the Public Library, and you will hear the newspapers exchanging remarks across the table in this language.  Said the pink valentine: \"I am prettier than you, much prettier, Miss Blue.\"  Blue was modester. \"That may be true, my dear Miss Pink; still, some folks like blue best, I think,\" she replied.  \"I wonder they should,\" went on Pink, talking in prose now, for valentines can speak in prose and in rhyme equally well. \"You are such a chilly color. Now _I_ warm people. They smile when they see me. I like that. It is sweet to give pleasure.\"  \"I like to give pleasure, too,\" said Blue, modestly. \"And I hope I may, for something beautiful is written inside me.\"  \"What? oh! what?\" cried Pink.  \"I cannot say,\" sighed Blue. \"How can one tell what is inside one? But I know it is something sweet, because            She who sent me here           Is so very fair and dear.\"  Blue was running into rhyme again, as valentines will.  \"I don't believe a word of it,\" said Pink, digging her sharp elbow into Blue's smooth side. \"Nothing is written inside me, and I'm glad of it. I am too beautiful to be written on. In the middle of my page is a picture, Cupid, with roses and doves. Oh, so fine! There is a border too, wreaths of flowers, flowers of all colors, and a motto, 'Be mine.' Be mine! What can be better than that? Have you got flowers and 'Be mine' inside, you conceited thing? If not, say so, and be ashamed, as you deserve to be.\"  Again the pink elbow dented Blue's smooth envelope.  But Blue only shook her head softly, and made no answer. Pink grew angry at this. She caught Blue with her little teeth of mucilage and shook her viciously.  \"Speak,\" she said. \"I hate your stuck-up, shut-up people. Speak!\"  But Blue only smiled, and again shook her head.  Just then the pillar-post opened with a click. The postman had come. He scooped up Pink, Blue, and all the other letters, and threw them into his wallet. A fat yellow envelope of law-papers separated the two valentines, and they had no further talk.  Half an hour later, Pink was left at the door of a grand house, almost the finest in the town. Charles, the waiter, carried her into the parlor, and Pink said to herself: \"What a thing it is to have a mission. My mission is to give pleasure!\"  \"A letter for you, Miss Eva,\" said Charles. He did not smile. Well-behaved waiters never smile; besides, Charles did not like Eva.  \"Where is your tray?\" demanded Eva, crossly. \"You are always forgetting what mamma told you. Go and get it.\" But when she saw Pink in her beautiful envelope, unmistakably a valentine, she decided not to wait.  \"Never mind, this time,\" she said; \"but don't let it happen again.\"  \"Who's your letter from, Evy?\" asked grandmamma.  \"I haven't opened it yet, and I wish you wouldn't call me Evy; it sounds so backwoodsy,\" replied Eva, who, for some mysterious reason, had waked that morning very much out of temper.  \"Eva!\" said her father, sternly.  Eva had forgotten that papa was there. To hide her confusion, she opened the pink envelope so hastily as to tear it all across.  \"Oh dear!\" she complained. \"Everything goes wrong.\"  Then she unfolded the valentine. Pink, who had felt as if a sword were thrust through her heart when her envelope was torn, brightened up.  \"Now,\" she thought, \"when she sees the flowers, Cupid, and doves, she _will_ be pleased.\"  But it was not pleasure which shone on Eva's countenance.  \"What's the matter?\" asked papa, seeing her face swell and angry tears filling her eyes.  \"That horrid Jim Slack!\" cried Eva. \"He said he'd send me a valentine just like Pauline's, and he hasn't. Hers was all birds and butterflies, and had verses--\"  \"Yours seems pretty enough,\" said papa, consolingly.  \"It's not pretty enough,\" responded Eva, passionately. \"It's a stupid, ugly thing. I hate it. I won't have it.\"  And, horrible to state, she flung Pink, actually flung her, into the middle of the fire. There was time for but one crackling gasp; then the yellow flame seized and devoured all--Cupid, doves, flowers! Another second, they were gone. A black scroll edged with fiery sparkles reared itself up in the midst of the glow; then an air-current seized it, it rose, and the soul of Pink flew up the chimney.  Blue, meantime, was lying on the lap of a little girl of twelve, a mile or more from this scene of tragedy. Two plump hands caressed her softly.  \"Sister, may I read it to you just once more?\" begged a coaxing voice.  \"Yes, Pet, once more. That'll make five times, and they say there is luck in odd numbers,\" said another voice, kind and gay.  So Pet read:--            \"My dear is like a dewy rose              All in the early morn;            But never on her stem there grows              A single wounding thorn.            \"My dear is like a violet shy,              Who hides her in the grass,            And holds a fragrant bud on high              To bless all men who pass.            \"My dear is like a merry bird,              My dear is like a rill,            Like all sweet things or seen or heard,              Only she's sweeter still.            \"And while she blooms beside my door,              Or sings beneath my sky,            My heart with happiness runs o'er,              Content and glad am I.            \"So, sweetheart, read me as I run,              Smile on this simple rhyme,            And choose me out to be your one              And only                VALENTINE.\"  \"Isn't it lovely?\" said Pet, her blue eyes dancing as she looked up.  \"Yes, it's very nice,\" replied sister.  \"I wish everybody in the world had such a nice valentine,\" went on Pet. \"How pleased they'd be! Do you suppose anybody has sent Lotty one? Only that about the bird wouldn't be true, because Lotty's so sick, you know, and always stays in bed.\"  \"But Lotty sings,\" said sister. \"She's always singing and cheerful, so she's like a bird in that.\"            \"Birdies with broken wings              Hide from each other;            But babies in trouble              Can run home to mother,\"  hummed Pet, who knew the \"St. Nicholas\" jingles by heart. \"But poor Lotty hasn't any mamma to run to,\" she added softly.  \"No; and that's a reason why it would be so specially nice to give her the pleasure of a valentine like yours.\"  \"I wish somebody had sent her one,\" said Pet, thoughtfully.  \"I don't suppose there is another in the world just like yours,\" said sister, smiling at Pet.  \"Then she _can't_ have one. What a pity!\"  \"She might have this of yours,\" suggested sister.  \"But--then--I shouldn't have any,\" cried Pet.  \"Oh yes, you would, and I'll tell you how,\" said sister. \"You've had all the pleasure of getting it, and opening and reading it, already. _That's_ yours to keep. Now, if I copy the verses for you on plain white paper, you can read them over as often as you like, till by and by you learn them by heart. When you have done that they will be yours for always; and, meanwhile, Lotty will have the pleasure of getting the valentine, opening, reading, learning, just as you have done--so you will get a double pleasure instead of one. Don't you see?\"  \"That will be splendid,\" cried Pet, joyously. \"Poor Lotty, how glad she will be! And I shall have two pleasures instead of one, shan't I?\"  \"How nice,\" thought Blue, \"to have given two pleasures already!\"  Sister copied the verses, a fresh envelope was found, and Blue was sent on her way. When she was carried upstairs to Lotty's room, she thought it the pleasantest place she had ever seen. Sunshine was there--on the wall, on the plants in the window, most of all in Lotty's face, as she sat up in bed, knitting with red worsted and big needles. When Blue was put into her hands, she laughed with astonishment.  \"For me!\" she cried. \"Who could have sent it? How pretty it is--how pretty! A great deal too pretty for me. Oh, what a kind, dear somebody there is in the world!\"  Everybody in the house was glad because Lotty was glad. Grandmamma came in to hear the valentine; so did papa, and Jack, Lotty's big brother, and Fred, her little one. Even the cook made up an excuse about the pudding, and stole upstairs to hear the \"fine verses which somebody had sint to Miss Lotty. It's swate as roses she is, any day,\" said cook; \"and good luck to him for sinding it, whoiver he is.\"  By and by Lotty's tender heart began to busy itself with a new plan.  \"Grandma,\" she said, \"I'm thinking about little Mary Riley. She works so hard, and she hardly ever has anything nice happen to her. Don't you think I might send her my valentine--in a different envelope, you know, with her name on it and all? She'd be so pleased.\"  \"But I thought you liked it so much yourself, dear,\" replied grandmamma, unwilling to have her darling spare one bit of brightness out of her sick-room life.  \"Oh, I do; that's the reason I want to give it away,\" said Lotty, simply, and stroking Blue, who, had she known how, would gladly have purred under the soft touch. \"But I shall go on liking it all the same if Mary has it, and she'll like it too. Don't you see, grandmamma? I've copied the verses in my book, so that I can keep them.\"  Grandmamma consented. The new envelope was found, Mary's address was written upon it, and away went happy Blue to give pleasure to a fresh friend.  \"This is best of all,\" she said to herself, as Mary laid aside her weary sewing to read over and over again the wonderful verses, which seemed to have dropped out of fairy-land. She almost cried with pleasure that they should be sent to _her_.  \"I wish I could buy a frame for 'em--a beautiful gold frame,\" she whispered to herself.  Pink would have been vain had she heard this; but Blue glowed with a purer feeling--the happiness of giving happiness.  Mary read the verses over a dozen times at least before putting them aside; but she did put them aside, for she had work to finish, and daylight was precious. The work was a birthday frock. When the last stitch was set, she folded it carefully, put on cloak and bonnet, and prepared to carry the frock home. Last of all, she dropped Blue into her pocket. She did not like to leave it behind. Something might happen, she thought.  It was quite a grand house to which the birthday frock went. In fact; it was next door but one to the house in which Pink met with her melancholy fate. The little girl who was to wear the frock was very glad to see Mary, and her mamma came upstairs to pay for the work.  \"Have you any change?\" she said. \"Come nearer to the fire. It is cold to-night.\"  Mary was confused by this kindness. Her fingers trembled as she searched for her porte-monnaie, which was at the bottom of her pocket, underneath her handkerchief. She twitched out the handkerchief hastily, and with it, alas! came Blue. They were close to the grate, and Blue was flung into the fire. Mary gave a scream and made a snatch. It was too late! Already the flames had seized it; her beloved valentine was gone, vanished into ashes!  \"Was it anything valuable?\" asked the lady, as Mary gave a little sob.  \"Oh, n-o--yes, ma'am; that is, it was verses. I never had any before. And they were s-o beautiful!\" replied poor Mary, half crying.  The lady gave her an extra dollar for the sewing, but this did not console Mary.  Meantime the ghost of Blue flew up the chimney. Upon the roof hovered a dim gray shade. It was the ghost of Pink, wind-blown for a little space.  \"How sad life is!\" sighed Pink's ghost--            \"I was young, I was fair,            And now I'm in the air,            As ugly gray ashes as ever were.\"  \"How sweet life is!\" murmured the ghost of Blue--            \"I've only lived a little while,            But I have made three people smile.\"  A chickadee who heard the two ghosts discoursing now flew down from the roof-peak. He gathered Blue's ashes up into his beak, flew down into the garden, and strewed them about the root of a rose-tree.  \"In the spring you'll be a rose,\" he said.  Then he flew back, took up Pink's ashes, bore them into another garden, and laid them in the midst of a bed of chickweed.  \"Make that chickweed crop a little richer, if you can,\" he chirped. \"All the better for the dicky-birds if you do; and a good thing for you too, to be of use for once in your life.\"  Then the chickadee flew away. Ghosts have to get accustomed to plain speaking.  This was the end of Blue and Pink.     A FORTUNATE MISFORTUNE.   EMMY GALE was far from anticipating misfortunes or suspecting that she was going to have any as she packed her trunk for the much-talked-of visit to Elliott's Mills. The very putting of the things into the trays was a pleasure, for it meant the satisfaction of a long-deferred wish. To go to Elliott's Mills had been the desire of her heart ever since she was a little girl of eight, and she was now fourteen; and she folded her dresses and patted each collar and pair of stockings into place with a glad feeling at her heart.  I must tell you about Elliott's Mills, or you will not understand why Emmy was so pleased to go there. It was a very small village in the western part of New York. To reach it you had to take, first a whole day's journey by rail, and then a two-mile drive over a rather rough road. When arrived there you found yourself in an ugly, unattractive little wooden hamlet, set down among low hills and tracts of woodland. This does not sound over-delightful, does it? But what made Elliott's Mills so charming was that Aunt Emma lived there during the summer, and the life that she and her family led had an inexpressible fascination for all the young people in the connection.  Aunt Emma's home had always been in New York City until her husband, who was a lawyer, came into possession some years before of an enormous tract of land, some thousands of acres in extent, in the western part of the State. It became necessary for him to spend some months there every year to look after it. First he built a small law office and a couple of bedrooms for use on these occasions. Then Aunt Emma wanted to go with him, and another room or two was added for her; and so it went on till the little law office had grown into a big, rambling country house of the most irregular shape, with small chambers opening out of large ones, doors, cupboards, entries, and staircases where you least expected them, little flights of steps leading up into rooms and down into rooms--just the sort of house, in short, which boys and girls delight in. Aunt Emma, who was a woman of admirable sense, made no attempt to introduce the elegances of the city into the woods, not even when it grew to be her home for the greater part of the year. Air, space, and freedom to do as you liked were the luxuries of the place. All the bedrooms were furnished with the same small-patterned blue ingrain carpet and little sets of oak-painted furniture precisely alike. The big parlor and dining-room had wicker chairs and willow tables, roomy sofas and couches covered with well-washed chintz, and skins and rugs on the matted floors. Deer's antlers in the hall held hats, whips, and coats. There was a garden of sweet common flowers to supply the summer vases, crackling wood-fires for cool evenings, and a bookcase of light reading for rainy days. The table was deliciously supplied with game and trout, wild fruits and country cream, and you might sit on the floor and tell ghost-stories till midnight if you cared to do so. In the big stables a little troop of Indian ponies, broken to saddle or harness, were kept. Most of them had Indian names, in honor of the half-civilized tribe which lived close by on their reservation. There was Chief Blacksnake and Lady Blacksnake and Young Blacksnake, Uncas and Pottomet and \"Xantego,\" commonly pronounced \"Want-to-go,\" and riding and driving went on the summer through among the visitors who filled the ample, hospitable house. There seemed to be a pony for everybody, and everybody liked to have a pony, and the ponies themselves enjoyed it.  Emmy Gale was her aunt Emma's namesake, but, as it happened, she had never been at Elliott's Mills, though her elder sisters, Bess and Jean, had made many visits there. This was partly accidental, for twice it had been arranged that she should go, and twice illness had prevented. Once, her cousin Lena had measles, and the other time Emmy herself had scarlet fever. Nobody was in fault either time, still it rankled in Emmy's mind that she should never have seen the place about which Bess and Jean were forever raving. And now her time was come; she was actually packing her trunk. No wonder she was pleased.  I must just say one word about Emmy before I start her on her journey. She was very tall of her age, thin, and rather awkward, as overgrown girls are apt to be. A passionate desire to be liked was one of the ruling motives of her nature, but she was very apt to fancy that people did not like her, and to worry and grieve over it in a morbid manner. When quite at her ease, she was an attractive girl, loving and bright and funny, but poor Emmy was seldom quite at ease. She could only be that when she forgot herself, and that was not often; for what with wondering if people would approve of her, and vexing herself with the idea that they did not, and fidgeting as to _why_ they did not, she contrived to be the subject of her own thoughts for a considerable part of the time.  Her escort was an old gentleman, a friend of her father's. He did not say much to Emmy, but he was very polite as old gentlemen go, and in the course of the long day's journey bought for her three illustrated papers, half a dozen beautiful red apples, and a \"prize package of pop-corn,\" which, had it chosen to live up to its label, _might_ have had a gold bracelet in it, but in reality contained nothing better than a brass ring. Emmy liked the apples, and did not at all resent her escort's lack of conversation. In fact, she scarcely noticed it, so busy was she in thinking of the joys to come. With her eyes fixed on the long reaches of soft red and yellow woods which seemed to be running past the train as the train ran by them, she made pictures to herself of what was going to happen. Lena would come down at the carriage to meet her, she was quite sure. And perhaps Bess or Jean, who had been at Elliott's Mills for the past month, would come too. It would be about half-past five when the train was due, so they could reach the house just before supper, which is always a pleasant time to arrive anywhere. It all seemed most promising as she thought it over.  The first bit of ill luck which befell Emmy was that the train proved to be behind time. There were tiresome stops and unaccountable delays. At noon the conductor owned to being two hours late, so they kept on losing time. Railroads are like a dissected puzzle--if one piece gets out of its place it makes the other pieces wrong. They had to wait for all the other trains, and telegraph and stand still. Tired and vexed, Emmy sat with her nose pressed against the window, looking out into the deepening dusk as the engine puffed and snorted and ran the train slowly back and forward, on to sidings and off them. Her impatience grew and grew, till it seemed as if she _must_ jump out and push something, the locomotive or the conductor--she didn't care which--anything to make them go on; and when eight o'clock came and nine, with the Mills station still far ahead, she felt so worn out and discouraged that she could easily have cried, except that girls of fourteen do not like to cry in public. The only thing that diverted her from her woes was watching two girls of her own age who sat in front of her, and were \"capping verses\" to pass away the time. The train made a great deal of noise, so that they had to scream to make themselves heard; then the roar and rumble ceased suddenly in that queer way which is common to all railroads, and a very high-pitched voice was heard to shriek out the following extraordinary question,--  \"Pray how was the Devil dressed? D--\" Everybody jumped, and Emmy's old gentleman put on his spectacles and gazed long and solemnly at the young ladies who seemed to be conversing on such extraordinary topics, while they hid their faces and giggled violently for two miles.  It was exactly ten when they finally reached the Mills station. The old gentleman helped Emmy out, the train rushed on, and she found herself standing alone on a wet platform beside her trunk. Her aunt's man William came to meet her, swinging a lantern.  \"Didn't any one come down to meet me?\" she asked.  \"No, miss. Mr. Tom drove down for the two o'clock express, and sent back word that your train would be late, and I must be sure to fetch a big lantern, for the road is all washed away by the freshet. Is that your box, miss? We'd better start at once, for it's going to take us two hours and a half to get over to the village.\"  \"Two hours and a half!\" gasped Emmy.  \"Yes, miss, because of the roads. They're almost dangerous. We'll have to walk nearly the whole way, for it's so dark that we can't see where we're going.\"  It was quite two hours and a half before they reached the house. Emmy had fallen asleep half a dozen times, and waked up to be conscious that she was stiff, chilled, and aching in every bone, and that William was walking at the horses' heads, holding the lantern up high to make sure of the road. At last they turned in at a gate and he came to the window to say encouragingly, \"Just there, miss.\"  \"What time is it?\" asked Emmy.  \"Nigh on to one, miss.\"  \"Oh dear, and they will all be in bed!\" thought Emmy; but she was really too tired to care much about it. A sleepy-looking maid was sitting up to receive her. Mrs. Elliott had left her love, she said, and the young lady must take some hot soup and get to bed as fast as possible. It was not at all the reception which Emmy had dreamed of, but she was so worn out with fatigue that bed seemed the only thing in the world worth thinking of just then, and there, with the assistance of the maid, she soon found herself.  When she woke, the room was bright with sun, which streamed into the window with such an \"up a long time ago\" expression, that Emmy knew she must have slept late. She was still tired, and lay quietly looking about her and recognizing all the little conveniences and devices of which she had heard from her sisters, till a little tap sounded, the door softly opened, and Aunt Emma's kind, handsome face looked in.  \"Good morning, my dear; I hope you are rested,\" she said, with a kiss. \"I would not let any one wake you, for you must have been tired out. Now you must have some breakfast.\" And in another moment, with the ease which seemed to characterize all arrangements in which Aunt Emma had a share, in came a napkin-covered tray borne by a neat little maid, with _such_ a nice breakfast! A big pink-and-white cup full of hot cocoa, broiled chicken, delicious potato stewed with cream, two white rolls, and a baked pear in a saucer. Nothing could have been more tempting to hungry Emmy, but even as she sipped the first spoonful of cocoa, the question at her heart found its way to her lips: \"Aunty, where are the girls?\"  \"The girls,\" said aunty in her pleasant, decided voice, \"are gone to Niagara for two or three days. A party was made up for some friends of your cousin May's who are staying with us, and Bess and Jean and Lena went too. They will be back day after to-morrow, and meanwhile you will have a chance to get thoroughly rested.\"  \"Gone to Niagara!\" exclaimed Emmy. \"Oh, why didn't they wait till I came!\"  \"That would not have been possible, my dear,\" said her aunt. \"The Jarvises, for whom the party was made, only stay with us till next Thursday, and May expects other guests early in the week, so she could not be away later.\" Then some one called her, and Aunt Emma went away, just saying kindly as she walked off, \"Make a good breakfast, dear!\"  Poor Emmy! she was too hungry not to eat, but the meal was literally mingled with tears. She sobbed with each mouthful, and more than one salt drop hopped down her nose to flavor the baked pear. It was foolish of her, I admit, but disappointments are hard to bear when one is only fourteen years old and very tired into the bargain, and this was a really great disappointment. Three whole days all alone with aunty, and the others away enjoying themselves at Niagara without her! She was rather afraid of her aunt, and, though very desirous to win her good opinion, this hidden fear made Emmy so shy and awkward that she never appeared at her best when in her company.  Sadly and languidly she got up and began to dress, feeling as if the heart was taken out of everything. Raising the lid of the soap-dish, there on the nice little pink cake of soap lay a note with \"Emmy\" written on it. Much wondering, she opened. It was from her sister Bess, and it read:--            \"DEAR EMMY,--Don't be poky because you find us           gone. It's only for a day or two, and we shall be           back almost before you miss us.\" (\"Not much chance           of that!\" reflected Emmy, dolorously.) \"Be a good           girl, laugh and talk with aunty, pet Uncle Tom,           _don't poke_, and be glad to see us on Saturday           night.                                          \"Your loving                                                     \"BESS.\"  \"How can I help poking, and what does she mean anyway?\" thought Emmy. However, this proof that she had been remembered cheered her a little, and she went on with her dressing in better spirits. A long folded slip of paper was pinned round the handle of the water-jug. Another note! from Jean this time.            \"DEAR LITTLE EMMY,\" (Emmy was half a head taller           than Jean!)--\"We hate to go away and leave you,           and we wouldn't if it were not so perfectly           splendid to see Niagara. It won't be long before           we come back, and you mustn't be lonely. Aunty is           so nice, and, dear, if only you wouldn't be afraid           of her! She doesn't like shy people, so don't be           shy. There's a lovely story-book in the bookcase           in the dining-room: 'The Dove in the Eagle's           Nest.' It's on the third shelf from the top. Do           read it while we are away! You will like it, I am           sure.                                    \"Your affectionate                                                   \"JEAN.\"  Jean was the kindest little soul in the world, but this hint about Aunt Emma's not liking shy people was a mistake. It made Emmy more frightened and ill at ease than ever.  Washing over, she went to the dressing-table to braid her hair. Behold! another billet on the pincushion. This was in rhyme:--            \"O Emmy tall, O Emmy fair,            Don't forget to brush your hair.            Pin your ruffle neat and straight,            Be down to breakfast at half-past eight;            Don't crook your shoulders when you sit down,            Don't rip the gathers of your gown,            Don't set up to be lonesome, pray,            Because we girls are gone away,            But cheer up auntie and Uncle Tom,            And we'll be back anon, anon!\"                                         \"ANON-Y-MOUS.\"  This made Emmy smile, and she did her hair quite cheerfully. When she opened the top drawer to put away her comb and brush, she spied a small parcel directed to herself, and laid there to catch her eye. She gave a little laugh. How nice in the girls to do this for her!  The parcel was from Lena. It contained a very pretty velvet pincushion, mounted on a fluted shell, and a note.            \"DEAR EMMY,--We are _so_ sorry not to be here when           you come, but we shall only be gone a little           while. Marian Jarvis is such a nice girl! She           wants to see you _dreadfully_. I do hope you will           like her. You must do everything pleasant that you           can think of till we come back.                                        \"Your loving                                                 \"LENA.\"  One more surprise awaited Emmy. She was just leaving the room when she spied a large piece of brown paper pinned to the wall. On it was the following mysterious inscription,--  \"N. E. corner of room, under edge of carpet. Search rewarded.\"  It took her some time to make out which was the northeast corner; when at last she identified it, all that appeared from under the carpet was a similar bit of paper with another mysterious inscription,--  \"S. W. corner of room, under edge of carpet. Search rewarded.\"  The reward of search in this instance was a long narrow parcel containing two brand-new hair-pins and a single line of writing,--  \"Behind looking-glass on bureau.\"  Highly diverted, Emmy hastened to tip the glass, and there, stored away behind it, she beheld a small white jam-pot. A label tucked in between lid and jar said succinctly,--  \"Plum jam at bedtime eaten with a hair-pin is _goloptious_! Try it!\"  All these jokes and surprises raised Emmy's spirits so that she ran down-stairs quite gleefully. But there things went wrong again. Aunt Emma was deep in household accounts. She nodded kindly to Emmy and said a few pleasant words; then she became absorbed in her reckonings and forgot her for the moment. Emmy was by no means one of those children who can be trusted to entertain themselves _in the room where any one else is sitting_. She was too self-conscious, too apt to imagine that people were criticising what she did or said. She wanted to ramble about the house and identify the things and places she had heard described, and if she had done this simply and naturally as Jean would, or Bess, no one would have been disturbed, least of all Aunt Emma. But a sense of shy awkwardness prevented, and what she did was to wait till her aunt was in the very middle of a long column of figures, and then say timidly,--  \"Aunt Emma, may I--may I--go into the dining-room?\"  Mrs. Elliott stopped, lost her count, and after trying in vain to recover it, said with a little natural impatience,--  \"My dear, never interrupt any one who is adding up a sum, if you can help it. You have lost me all my last ten minutes' work. What did you say? go into the dining-room? why, of course, go just where you like.\" Then she began to cipher again.  This was quite enough to make Emmy miserable. She had done wrong. She had put Aunt Emma out. Aunt Emma did not love her. She never would love her as she loved the other girls! These reflections passed through her mind as she sat before the glass door of the bookcase, not even trying to look up the story which Jean had recommended. Uncle Tom coming into the room noticed her melancholy attitude, and said in his hearty voice, \"Well, my little maid, you look dumpy. All your contemporaries gone, heh! Never mind; they will all be back soon, and meanwhile you must cheer up the old folks.\" Jean or Bess would have dimpled and giggled at such an address, and perhaps run across the room and given Uncle Tom a kiss; but Emmy only shrank a little and said nothing; so that her uncle, as he drank his glass of Apollinaris water, said to himself, \"A sulky child, I'm afraid.\" So easy it is to be misjudged in this world.  At dinner, Emmy's evil angel took possession of her again. She answered in monosyllables when her uncle and aunt spoke to her, and poked her food into her mouth with a nervous haste which brought on a fit of choking. This mortified her deeply, for she imagined that Aunt Emma was thinking, \"What an ill-mannered girl she is!\" whereas Aunt Emma was really thinking, \"Poor thing! what can I do to make her feel more comfortable?\" It would be a convenience, sometimes, if we might have glass panes in our hearts, so that people could look in and see what we are really feeling.  The evening seemed dreadfully long. Emmy pretended to read \"The Dove in the Eagle's Nest,\" but a sort of spell of stiff misery was over her all the while. She was conscious of her knees and elbows, her upper lip kept twitching, she neither acted nor spoke naturally. Mrs. Elliott pitied her, but she could not help saying to herself, \"What a self-conscious child she is; how different from Jean and Bess!\" And what was worse, Emmy suspected that aunty was thinking exactly that, and suffered accordingly.  Tom came home next day. He was an immensely tall, handsome, good-natured young man. Bess and Jean adored him, and were always telling stories about the things he said and did, but to Emmy he seemed a formidable person. He was fond of teasing and of banter, and it was another of his peculiarities to be particularly observant about a lady's dress. He noticed at once that the braid was ripped off the edge of Emmy's skirt so as to form a dangerous little loop, and told her of it. She went away at once, and sewed it fast, but she felt disgraced somehow, and marked out as a slattern, and could not help shedding a few tears as she worked. Then Tom, who saw everything, observed the red marks under her eyes, and the melancholy droop of her mouth, and he too set her down as sulky, and, supposing that she had taken offence at some of his harmless pleasantries, forbore to joke with her thenceforward. This made her sure that Tom did not like her either, which was another affliction, for Emmy was most anxious to be taken into the circle of his pets and favorites.  In the afternoon she had another mishap. Aunt Emma sent her to get a paper out of her writing-desk, and Emmy somehow managed to hamper the lock so that the key could not be turned. Nobody scolded her, but Mrs. Elliott looked sorry and perplexed, as well she might, with the nearest locksmith twenty miles distant, and Emmy felt that her cup of misfortune was full. That night she cried herself to sleep.  On the third day the party from Niagara came back, and the house all in a moment seemed to fill with bright life and gayety. Cousin May's friends, the Jarvises, were handsome, well-bred girls, with a great deal of air and style about all their appointments. Cousin May herself was a belle and beauty, and had always been the object of Emmy's wildest admiration. Several gentlemen were of the party, and there were Jean and Bess running about with the rest, on the friendliest terms with everybody, and as much at home as Lena. It made Emmy feel left out and lonely, for her shyness was by no means lessened by the arrival of all these strangers, and she had the painful sensation of being separated from the others by a sort of invisible wall, which she could not, and they would not, pass over. Jean and Bess did what they could to cheer her, but a great deal was going on in the large gay household, and they had not much time to spare for the little sister who could not explain even to herself why she felt so forlorn.  Lady Blacksnake was supposed to be Lena's own particular pony. Lena had a little wagon of her own too; and on Monday she took Emmy out with her. This went delightfully till, as they were coming home late in the afternoon, Emmy coaxed Lena to let her drive. What she did to Lady Blacksnake no one ever knew, but all in one minute that excellent animal put her head down and ran away.  \"Oh,\" screamed Emmy, \"shall we jump out?\"  \"No,\" said Lena, perfectly calm, though her face was very white. \"Saw her mouth.\"  So she took one rein, and Emmy the other, and they sawed Lady Blacksnake's mouth with hard, regular pulls, till the wild pace slackened first to a gallop and then to a trot, and they were going along at their old rate, only Lady Blacksnake's heaving flanks and their own frightened countenances telling the tale of their late danger. It was real danger, for once during the run the hind wheel absolutely grazed the edge of a sharp bank, and had they met another carriage they could scarcely have escaped a collision; but they both agreed to make as light of the incident as they could when they got home, lest they should be forbidden to go out again by themselves. Their account of the accident therefore was given with a levity which quite angered Uncle Tom.  \"Upon my word, young ladies,\" he said severely, \"you seem to think it a fine thing to have been in danger of your lives. If you had really broken all your bones it would have been funnier still, I suppose. What on earth _are_ you laughing at?\" for somehow this address tickled the girls' half-hysterical mood into paroxysms of giggling which continued till they cried, and the more Uncle Tom frowned the more they giggled. Aunt Emma saw how it was, and ordered them off to bed, and next morning the reaction had come, and they were pale and nervous and depressed enough to please the most exacting friend who might be anxious to make them \"sensible of their escape.\"  Wednesday, the day before the Jarvises were to leave, had been set aside for a picnic. Emmy had looked forward eagerly to this; so you can imagine her feelings when on Tuesday a hard toothache set in which kept her awake all night, and left her next morning still in such pain and with such a swollen face that it was manifestly impossible for her to leave the house. Kind little Jean offered to give up the picnic and stay at home with her; but neither Emmy nor Aunt Emma would hear of this, and it ended in everybody's going and leaving her in the care of old Eliza, aunty's housekeeper, who had been nurse to all the children in turn, from Tom to Lena, and liked nothing better than a chance to cuddle and cosset any one who was ill.  Her warm fomentations and roasted raisins and pettings and pattings were so effectual that by afternoon Emmy felt quite comfortable again. She grew very fond of kind old Eliza, and her heart being opened by the situation, she ended by telling her how miserable and \"unlucky\" she had been all the week.  \"And indeed I can't see any reason for it, though I'm sorry enough it is so, Miss Emmy,\" declared Eliza when she had listened to the tale. \"Never any young person came here before who didn't look upon this house as a kind of a paradise.\"  \"I know. That's just the way Jean and Bess feel. But then they are different from me. Everybody likes them,\" said Emmy.  \"And pray why shouldn't they like yourself, miss, I'd like to ask?\"  \"I--don't--know,\" slowly. \"I'm always getting into scrapes and making mistakes, and things don't happen nicely with me as they do with them. Just think of all the misfortunes I've had this week since I came! My train was late, and I was all tired out, and the girls went to Niagara without me, and I broke Aunt Emma's lock, and the horse ran away, and now this toothache! I am _very_ unfortunate.\"  \"Well, I _have_ heard of other people's trains being late afore now,\" replied Eliza, dryly. \"And though I'm sorry you didn't have the trip with the rest, miss, it wasn't nobody's fault that you didn't come in time. It was a pity about the lock, to be sure--the Madam hasn't got it open yet, I know--but so far as the horse goes, it's no more than I'm always expecting, letting Miss Lena drive out by herself with them vicious little rats of ponies. And God sent your toothache, miss, I suppose you know that.\"  \"Well, God made me shy, too, I suppose, and that's my worst misfortune of all,\" declared Emmy.  \"I'm not so sure about that, either,\" remarked the shrewd old Eliza. \"In my opinion, what folks call shyness is very often just another name for selfishness. If you thought about yourself less and about other people more, Miss Emmy, you wouldn't be so shy, as you call it. You'll get better of it as soon as you're old enough to find out that for the most part of the time nobody is noticing what you do or thinking about you at all.\"  There was a certain tonic in this speech of Eliza's which did Emmy good. She lay meditating upon it that night after the girls had come in to kiss her and say how dreadfully they had missed her at the picnic, and how she must get quite well before next Monday, when they were going to have another. She had slept so much during the day that she was not sleepy now, and she lay turning over in her mind what Eliza had said. _Was_ shyness selfishness? and was it her own fault that she got on so badly and made so many mistakes? or was she really marked for misfortune and doomed to be misunderstood, as she had sometimes imagined? She thought of Bess and Jean with a little wonderment of envy. How pretty and nice they were! how people liked them! how easy it seemed to them to be graceful and natural and at ease with strangers!  While she was thus thinking, a queer little noise met her ear, like some one snapping two sticks together. Again it came and yet again, and Emmy was sure that she smelt a slight smell of burning. All her little foolish fancies fled at once. She jumped out of bed, lit a candle, slipped on her dressing-gown, and opened the door. The burning smell was stronger in the entry, and the air was dim with smoke. Not nervous now nor cowardly, Emmy ran down-stairs with all her wits about her, following the smoke till she came to Uncle Tom's office. The door stood half open, and inside she saw a flaring light. The carpet was on fire in front of the grate, flames were creeping up the legs of the table, which was covered with papers. Emmy knew that some of these papers were valuable, and without a thought of fear she hurried in, gathered as many as she could in her hands, flung them into the hall, ran back for more, and never stopped till all were safe. Then she ran to Uncle Tom's dressing-closet for a pitcher of water which she knew was kept there, and dashed it on the flames, all the time calling at the top of her voice, \"Fire! fire! fire! O Tom! O aunty! O Uncle Tom! O somebody! Come, please come! Oh, why don't you hear!\"  It is astonishing how long it takes to wake up people who are sound asleep. Emmy had time to fetch another pitcher of water from the kitchen, and the fire was nearly out before the family came rushing down, half dressed and bewildered, to her aid. Fires are easily managed if they are taken in hand exactly at the right time, but half an hour more or less makes a great difference. Emmy had acted at the critical moment, and her courage and presence of mind had probably saved the house.  Uncle Tom declared that he owed her ten thousand dollars. Part of this debt he paid the very next week by the present of the prettiest little gold watch and chain ever seen, with the date of the fire engraved inside the watch-lid. Aunty, too much agitated to speak, folded Emmy in her arms and gave her a great squeeze which said more than words. Tom, when he understood the whole, said that she was \"a brick,\" and that not one girl in a thousand would have been so plucky or shown so much sense. So poor, awkward Emmy, who had fared so ill up to this time, got up next morning, like Lord Byron, to find herself famous, and the heroine of the house.  To be praised and made much of does some people harm, but to others it does a great deal of good. Emmy did not grow vain when she found herself thus made important. She only felt that she was liked, and approved of, and it set her at her ease. From that day Elliott's Mills grew delightful to her as it had always been to her sisters. She ran about freely among the others, talked, laughed, shared in the fun that was going on, and enjoyed every moment of her visit.  Years afterward, when she and Aunt Emma had grown intimate, Emmy told that dear friend and relative whom she had learned to love and admire better than any one else except her own mother, the story of her foolish troubles.  \"But indeed,\" she ended, \"they were lucky troubles to me, for I never was so bad after that. I think what old Eliza said about selfishness stuck in my mind, and I found out after a while that she was pretty much right, and that the way to be comfortable and at ease was to think about other people instead of myself.\"  \"And I am sure,\" replied Aunt Emma, \"that your troubles were lucky troubles for us. If you hadn't had the toothache and lain awake meditating on that and your other sorrows, I'm sure I don't know where we should all be now, my dear little Emmy.\"     TOINETTE AND THE ELVES.   THE winter sun was nearing the horizon's edge. Each moment the tree-shadows grew longer in the forest; each moment the crimson light on the upper boughs became more red and bright. It was Christmas Eve, or would be in half an hour, when the sun should be fairly set; but it did not feel like Christmas, for the afternoon was mild and sweet, and the wind in the leafless boughs sang, as it moved about, as though to imitate the vanished birds. Soft trills and whistles, odd little shakes and twitters,--it was astonishing what pretty noises the wind made, for it was in good humor, as winds should be on the Blessed Night; all its storm-tones and bass-notes were for the moment laid aside, and gently, as though hushing a baby to sleep, it cooed and rustled and brushed to and fro in the leafless woods.  Toinette stood, pitcher in hand, beside the well. \"Wishing Well,\" the people called it, for they believed that if any one standing there, bowed to the East, repeated a certain rhyme and wished a wish, the wish would certainly come true. Unluckily, nobody knew exactly what the rhyme should be. Toinette did not; she was wishing that she did, as she stood with her eyes fixed on the bubbling water. How nice it would be! she thought. What beautiful things should be hers, if it were only to wish and to have! She would be beautiful, rich, good--oh, so good! The children should love her dearly, and never be disagreeable. Mother should not work so hard--they should all go back to France--which mother said was _si belle_. Oh, dear, how nice it would be! Meantime, the sun sank lower, and mother at home was waiting for the water, but Toinette forgot that.  Suddenly she started. A low sound of crying met her ear, and something like a tiny moan. It seemed close by, but she saw nothing.  Hastily she filled her pitcher, and turned to go. But again the sound came, an unmistakable sob, right under her feet. Toinette stopped short.  \"What _is_ the matter?\" she called out bravely.  \"Is anybody there; and if there is, why don't I see you?\"  A third sob--and all at once, down on the ground beside her, a tiny figure became visible, so small that Toinette had to kneel and stoop her head to see it plainly. The figure was that of an odd little man. He wore a garb of green, bright and glancing as the scales of a beetle. In his mite of a hand was a cap, out of which stuck a long-pointed feather. Two specks of tears stood on his cheeks, and he fixed on Toinette a glance so sharp and so sad, that it made her feel sorry and frightened and confused all at once.  \"Why, how funny this is!\" she said, speaking to herself out loud.  \"Not at all,\" replied the little man, in a voice as dry and crisp as the chirr of a grasshopper. \"Anything but funny. I wish you wouldn't use such words. It hurts my feelings, Toinette.\"  \"Do you know my name, then?\" cried Toinette, astonished. \"That's strange! But what is the matter? Why are you crying so, little man?\"  \"I'm not a little man. I'm an elf,\" responded the dry voice; \"and I think you'd cry if you had an engagement out to tea, and found yourself spiked on a great bayonet, so that you couldn't move an inch. Look!\" He turned a little as he spoke, and Toinette saw a long rose-thorn sticking through the back of the green robe. The little man could by no means reach the thorn, and it held him fast prisoner to the place.  \"Is that all? I'll take it out for you,\" she said.  \"Be careful--oh, be careful!\" entreated the little man. \"This is my new dress, you know--my Christmas suit, and it's got to last a year. If there is a hole in it, Peascod will tickle me, and Bean Blossom tease till I shall wish myself dead.\" He stamped with vexation at the thought.  \"Now, you mustn't do that,\" said Toinette, in a motherly tone, \"else you'll tear it yourself, you know.\" She broke off the thorn as she spoke, and gently drew it out. The elf anxiously examined the stuff. A tiny puncture only was visible, and his face brightened.  \"You're a good child,\" he said. \"I'll do as much for you some day, perhaps.\"  \"I would have come before if I had seen you,\" remarked Toinette, timidly. \"But I didn't see you a bit.\"  \"No, because I had my cap on,\" replied the elf. He placed it on his head as he spoke, and, hey, presto! nobody was there, only a voice which laughed and said: \"Well--don't stare so. Lay your finger on me now.\"  \"Oh!\" said Toinette, with a gasp. \"How wonderful! What fun it must be to do that! The children wouldn't see me. I should steal in and surprise them; they would go on talking, and never guess that I was there! I should so like it! Do elves ever lend their caps to anybody? I wish you'd lend me yours. It must be so nice to be invisible!\"  \"Ho!\" cried the elf, appearing suddenly again. \"Lend my cap, indeed! Why, it wouldn't stay on the very tip of your ear, it's so small. As for nice, that depends. Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't. No, the only way for mortal people to be invisible is to gather the fern-seed and put it in their shoes.\"  \"Gather it? Where? I never saw any seed to the ferns,\" said Toinette, staring about her.  \"Of course not--we elves take care of that,\" replied the little man. \"Nobody finds the fern-seed but ourselves. I'll tell you what, though. You were such a nice child to take out the thorn so cleverly, that I'll _give_ you a little of the seed. Then you can try the fun of being invisible, to your heart's content.\"  \"Will you really? How delightful! May I have it now?\"  \"Bless me! do you think I carry my pocket stuffed with it?\" said the elf. \"Not at all. Go home, say not a word to anybody, but leave your bedroom window open to-night, and you'll see what you'll see.\"  He laid his finger on his nose as he spoke, gave a jump like a grasshopper, clapping on his cap as he went, and vanished. Toinette lingered a moment, in hopes that he might come back, then took her pitcher and hurried home. The woods were very dusky by this time; but, full of her strange adventure, she did not remember to feel afraid.  \"How long you have been!\" said her mother. \"It's late for a little maid like you to be up. You must make better speed another time, my child.\"  Toinette pouted, as she was apt to do when reproved. The children clamored to know what had kept her, and she spoke pettishly and crossly; so that they too became cross, and presently went away into the outer kitchen to play by themselves. The children were apt to creep away when Toinette came. It made her angry and unhappy at times that they should do so, but she did not realize that it was in great part her own fault, and so did not set herself to mend it.  \"Tell me a 'tory,\" said baby Jeanneton, creeping to her knee a little later. But Toinette's head was full of the elf; she had no time to spare for Jeanneton.  \"Oh, not to-night!\" she replied. \"Ask mother to tell you one.\"  \"Mother's busy,\" said Jeanneton, wistfully.  Toinette took no notice, and the little one crept away disconsolately.  Bedtime at last. Toinette set the casement open, and lay a long time waiting and watching; then she fell asleep. She waked with a sneeze and jump, and sat up in bed. Behold, on the coverlet stood her elfin friend, with a long train of other elves beside him, all clad in the beetle-wing green, and wearing little pointed caps! More were coming in at the window; outside a few were drifting about in the moon-rays, which lit their sparkling robes till they glittered like so many fire-flies. The odd thing was, that though the caps were on, Toinette could see the elves distinctly, and this surprised her so much, that again she thought out loud, and said, \"How funny!\"  \"You mean about the caps,\" replied her special elf, who seemed to have the power of reading thoughts. \"Yes, you can see us tonight, caps and all. Spells lose their value on Christmas Eve, always. Peascod, where is the box? Do you still wish to try the experiment of being invisible, Toinette?\"  \"Oh, yes--indeed I do!\"  \"Very well--so let it be!\"  As he spoke he beckoned, and two elves, puffing and panting like men with a heavy load, dragged forward a droll little box about the size of a pumpkin-seed. One of them lifted the cover.  \"Pay the porter, please, ma'am,\" he said, giving Toinette's ear a mischievous tweak with his sharp fingers.  \"Hands off, you bad Peascod!\" cried Toinette's elf. \"This is my girl. She shan't be pinched.\" He dealt Peascod a blow with his tiny hand as he spoke, and looked so brave and warlike that he seemed at least an inch taller than he had before. Toinette admired him very much; and Peascod slunk away with an abashed giggle, muttering that Thistle needn't be so ready with his fist.  Thistle--for thus, it seemed, Toinette's friend was named--dipped his fingers in the box, which was full of fine brown seeds, and shook a handful into each of Toinette's shoes, as they stood, toes together, by the bedside.  \"Now you have your wish,\" he said, \"and can go about and do what you like, no one seeing. The charm will end at sunset. Make the most of it while you can; but if you want to end it sooner, shake the seeds from the shoes, and then you are just as usual.\"  \"Oh, I shan't want to,\" protested Toinette; \"I'm sure I shan't.\"  \"Good-by,\" said Thistle, with a mocking little laugh.  \"Good-by, and thank you ever so much,\" replied Toinette.  \"Good-by, good-by,\" replied the other elves, in shrill chorus. They clustered together, as if in consultation; then straight out of the window they flew like a swarm of gauzy-winged bees, and melted into the moonlight. Toinette jumped up and ran to watch them; but the little men were gone--not a trace of them was to be seen; so she shut the window, went back to bed, and presently, in the midst of her amazed and excited thoughts, fell asleep.  She waked in the morning with a queer, doubtful feeling. Had she dreamed, or had it really happened? She put on her best petticoat, and laced her blue bodice; for she thought the mother would perhaps take them across the wood to the little chapel for the Christmas service. Her long hair smoothed and tied, her shoes trimly fastened, down-stairs she ran. The mother was stirring porridge over the fire. Toinette went close to her, but she did not move or turn her head.  \"How late the children are!\" she said at last, lifting the boiling pot on the hob. Then she went to the stair-foot, and called, \"Marc, Jeanneton, Pierre, Marie! Breakfast is ready, my children. Toinette--but where, then, is Toinette? She is used to be down long before this.\"  \"Toinette isn't up-stairs,\" said Marie, from above. \"Her door is wide open, and she isn't there.\"  \"That is strange!\" said the mother. \"I have been here an hour, and she has not passed this way since.\" She went to the outer door and called, \"Toinette! Toinette!\"--passing close to Toinette as she did so, and looking straight at her with unseeing eyes. Toinette, half frightened, half pleased, giggled low to herself. She really was invisible then! How strange it seemed, and what fun it was going to be!  The children sat down to breakfast, little Jeanneton, as the youngest, saying grace. The mother distributed the hot porridge, and gave each a spoon, but she looked anxious.  \"Where can Toinette have gone?\" she said to herself.  Toinette was conscience-pricked. She was half inclined to dispel the charm on the spot. But just then she caught a whisper from Pierre to Marc, which so surprised her as to put the idea out of her head.  \"Perhaps a wolf has eaten her up--a great big wolf, like the 'Capuchon Rouge,' you know.\" This was what Pierre said; and Marc answered, unfeelingly,--  \"If he has, I shall ask mother to let me have her room for my own!\"  Poor Toinette! her cheeks burnt and her eyes filled with tears at this. Didn't the boys love her a bit, then? Next she grew angry, and longed to box Marc's ears, only she recollected in time that she was invisible. What a bad boy, he was! she thought.  The smoking porridge reminded her that she was hungry; so brushing away the tears, she slipped a spoon off the table, and whenever she found the chance, dipped it into the bowl for a mouthful. The porridge disappeared rapidly.  \"I want some more,\" said Jeanneton.  \"Bless me, how fast you have eaten!\" said the mother, turning to the bowl.  This made Toinette laugh, which shook her spoon, and a drop of the hot mixture fell right on the tip of Marie's nose, as she sat with upturned face waiting her turn for a second helping. Marie gave a little scream.  \"What is it?\" said the mother.  \"Hot water! Right in my face!\" spluttered Marie.  \"Water!\" cried Marc. \"It's porridge.\"  \"You spattered with your spoon. Eat more carefully, my child,\" said the mother; and Toinette laughed again as she heard her. After all, there was some fun in being invisible!  The morning went by. Constantly the mother went to the door, and, shading her eyes with her hand, looked out, in hopes of seeing a little figure come down the wood-path, for she thought, perhaps the child went to the spring after water, and fell asleep there. The children played happily, meanwhile. They were used to doing without Toinette, and did not seem to miss her, except that now and then baby Jeanneton said: \"Poor Toinette gone--not here--all gone!\"  \"Well, what if she has?\" said Marc at last, looking up from the wooden cup he was carving for Marie's doll. \"We can play all the better.\"  Marc was a bold, outspoken boy, who always told his whole mind about things.  \"If she were here,\" he went on, \"she'd only scold and interfere. Toinette almost always scolds. I like to have her go away. It makes it pleasanter.\"  \"It _is_ rather pleasanter,\" admitted Marie, \"only I'd like her to be having a nice time somewhere else.\"  \"Bother about Toinette!\" cried Pierre. \"Let's play 'My godmother has cabbage to sell.'\"  I don't think Toinette had ever felt so unhappy in her life, as when she stood by unseen, and heard the children say these words. She had never meant to be unkind to them, but she was quick-tempered, dreamy, wrapped up in herself. She did not like being interrupted by them, it put her out, and then she spoke sharply and was cross. She had taken it for granted that the others must love her, by a sort of right, and the knowledge that they did not grieved her very much. Creeping away, she hid herself in the woods. It was a sparkling day, but the sun did not look so bright as usual. Cuddled down under a rose-bush, Toinette sat sobbing as if her heart would break at the recollection of the speeches she had overheard.  By and by a little voice within her woke up and began to make itself audible. All of us know this little voice. We call it conscience.  \"Jeanneton missed me,\" she thought. \"And, oh dear! I pushed her away only last night and wouldn't tell her a story. And Marie hoped I was having a pleasant time somewhere. I wish I hadn't slapped Marie last Friday. And I wish I hadn't thrown Marc's ball into the fire that day I was angry with him. How unkind he was to say that--but I wasn't always kind to him. And once I said that I wished a bear would eat Pierre up. That was because he broke my cup. Oh dear, oh dear! What a bad girl I've been to them all!\"  \"But you could be better and kinder if you tried, couldn't you?\" said the inward voice. \"I think you could.\" And Toinette clasped her hands tight and said out loud: \"I could. Yes--and I will.\"  The first thing to be done was to get rid of the fern-seed, which she now regarded as a hateful thing. She untied her shoes and shook it out in the grass. It dropped, and seemed to melt into the air, for it instantly vanished. A mischievous laugh sounded close behind, and a beetle-green coat-tail was visible, whisking under a tuft of rushes. But Toinette had had enough of the elves, and, tying her shoes, took the road toward home, running with all her might.  \"Where have you been all day, Toinette?\" cried the children, as, breathless and panting, she flew in at the gate. But Toinette could not speak. She made slowly for her mother, who stood in the doorway, flung herself into her arms, and burst into a passion of tears.  \"Ma chrie, what is it, whence hast thou come?\" asked the good mother, alarmed. She lifted Toinette into her arms as she spoke, and hastened indoors. The other children followed, whispering and peeping, but the mother sent them away, and, sitting down by the fire with Toinette in her lap, she rocked and hushed and comforted, as though Toinette had been again a little baby. Gradually the sobs ceased. For a while Toinette lay quiet, with her head on her mother's breast. Then she wiped her wet eyes, put her arms around her mother's neck, and told her all from the very beginning, keeping not a single thing back. The dame listened with alarm.  \"Saints protect us,\" she muttered. Then feeling Toinette's hands and head, \"Thou hast a fever,\" she said. \"I will make thee a _tisane_, my darling, and thou must at once go to bed.\" Toinette vainly protested; to bed she went, and perhaps it was the wisest thing, for the warm drink threw her into a long, sound sleep, and when she woke she was herself again, bright and well, hungry for dinner, and ready to do her usual tasks.  Herself,--but not quite the same Toinette that she had been before. Nobody changes from bad to better in a minute. It takes time for that, time and effort, and a long struggle with evil habits and tempers. But there is sometimes a certain minute or day in which people _begin_ to change, and thus it was with Toinette. The fairy lesson was not lost upon her. She began to fight with herself, to watch her faults and try to conquer them. It was hard work; often she felt discouraged, but she kept on. Week after week and month after month she grew less selfish, kinder, more obliging than she used to be. When she failed, and her old fractious temper got the better of her, she was sorry, and begged every one's pardon so humbly that they could not but forgive. The mother began to think that the elves really had bewitched her child. As for the children, they learned to love Toinette as never before, and came to her with all their pains and pleasures, as children should to a kind older sister. Each fresh proof of this, every kiss from Jeanneton, every confidence from Marc, was a comfort to Toinette, for she never forgot Christmas Day, and felt that no trouble was too much to wipe out that unhappy recollection. \"I _think_ they like me better than they did then,\" she would say; but then the thought came, \"Perhaps if I were invisible again, if they did not know I was there, I might hear something to make me feel as badly as I did that morning.\" These sad thoughts were part of the bitter fruit of the fairy fern-seed.  So with doubts and fears the year went by, and again it was Christmas Eve. Toinette had been asleep some hours, when she was roused by a sharp tapping at the window-pane. Startled and only half awake, she sat up in bed, and saw by the moonlight a tiny figure outside, which she recognized. It was Thistle, drumming with his knuckles on the glass.  \"Let me in,\" cried the dry little voice. So Toinette opened the casement, and Thistle flew in and perched, as before, on the coverlet.  \"Merry Christmas, my girl,\" he said, \"and a Happy New Year when it comes! I've brought you a present;\" and, dipping into a pouch tied round his waist, he pulled out a handful of something brown. Toinette knew what it was in a moment.  \"Oh, no!\" she cried, shrinking back. \"Don't give me any fern-seeds. They frighten me. I don't like them.\"  \"Now, don't be silly,\" said Thistle, his voice sounding kind this time, and earnest. \"It wasn't pleasant being invisible last year, but perhaps this year it will be. Take my advice, and try it. You'll not be sorry.\"  \"Shan't I?\" said Toinette, brightening. \"Very well then, I will.\" She leaned out of bed, and watched Thistle strew the fine, dust-like grains in each shoe.  \"I'll drop in to-morrow night, and just see how you like it,\" he said. Then, with a nod, he was gone.  The old fear came back when she woke in the morning, and she tied on her shoes with a tremble at her heart. Down-stairs she stole. The first thing she saw was a wooden ship standing on her plate. Marc had made the ship, but Toinette had no idea that it was for her.  The little ones sat round the table with their eyes on the door, watching till Toinette should come in, and be surprised.  \"I wish she'd hurry,\" said Pierre, drumming on his bowl with a spoon.  \"We all want Toinette, don't we?\" said the mother, smiling as she poured the hot porridge.  \"It will be fun to see her stare,\" declared Marc. \"Toinette is jolly when she stares. Her eyes look big, and her cheeks grow pink. Andre Brugen thinks his sister Aline is prettiest, but I don't. Our Toinette is ever so pretty.\"  \"She is ever so nice, too,\" said Pierre. \"She's as good to play with as--as--a boy!\" he finished triumphantly.  \"Oh, I wish my Toinette _would_ come!\" said Jeanneton.  Toinette waited no longer, but sped up-stairs with glad tears in her eyes. Two minutes, and down she came again, visible this time. Her heart was light as a feather.  \"Merry Christmas!\" clamored the children. The ship was presented, Toinette was duly surprised, and so the happy day began.  That night Toinette left the window open, and lay down in her clothes; for she felt, as Thistle had been so kind, she ought to receive him politely. He came at midnight, and with him all the other little men in green.  \"Well, how was it?\" asked Thistle.  \"Oh, I liked it this time,\" declared Toinette, with shining eyes. \"And I thank you so much!\"  \"I'm glad you did,\" said the elf. \"And I'm glad you are thankful, for we want you to do something for us.\"  \"What can it be?\" inquired Toinette, wondering.  \"You must know,\" went on Thistle, \"that there is no dainty in the world which we elves enjoy like a bowl of fern-seed broth. But it has to be cooked over a real fire, and we dare not go near fire, you know, lest our wings scorch. So we seldom get any fern-seed broth. Now, Toinette--will you make us some?\"  \"Indeed I will,\" cried Toinette, \"only you must tell me how.\"  \"It is very simple,\" said Peascod; \"only seed and honey dew, stirred from left to right with a sprig of fennel. Here's the seed and the fennel, and here's the dew. Be sure and stir from the left; if you don't, it curdles, and the flavor will be spoiled.\"  Down into the kitchen they went, and Toinette, moving very softly, quickened the fire, set on the smallest bowl she could find, and spread the doll's table with the wooden saucers which Marc had made for Jeanneton to play with. Then she mixed and stirred as the elves bade, and when the soup was done, served it to them smoking hot. How they feasted! No bumble-bee, dipping into a flower-cup, ever sipped and twinkled more rapturously than they.  When the last drop was eaten, they made ready to go. Each, in turn, kissed Toinette's hand, and said a little word of farewell. Thistle brushed his feathered cap over the door-post as he passed.  \"Be lucky, house,\" he said, \"for you have received and entertained the luck-bringers. And be lucky, Toinette. Good temper _is_ good luck, and sweet words and kind looks and peace in the heart are the fairest of fortunes. See that you never lose them again, my girl.\" With this, he too kissed Toinette's hand, waved his feathered cap, and--whir! they all were gone, while Toinette, covering the fire with ashes, and putting aside the little cups, stole up to her bed a happy child.     JEAN'S MONEY, AND WHAT IT BOUGHT.   THE last recitation of the last day of the district school-term was over, and the boys and girls shut their books and put away slates and pencils, with a glad sense of liberty immediately at hand, which made it doubly hard to sit still for the few remaining moments. Jean Thompson, their teacher, was almost as impatient as they. She was but seventeen, scarcely older than her oldest scholar, and in her joy at getting through the term would doubtless have made short work of the closing exercises, had not Mr. Gillicraft been there. Mr. Gillicraft was the senior member of the school board,--a slow, formal man, who liked things done ceremoniously, so for his sake there had to be a little delay. He made a speech to the children, speaking at length and deliberately. They were all pleased to have vacation begin, no doubt, but he hoped, etc. He was sure they would join him in thanking their excellent teacher, Miss Thompson, for the judicious manner in which, etc. He trusted the moral discipline inculcated during the term would not, etc. And he hoped some at least of them would find time to study somewhat during the vacation, and thus redeem time which otherwise would be idly spent. The children fidgeted dreadfully during these remarks. The blue sky and bright air wooed and coaxed them through the open door; their feet were dancing with impatience, how _could_ they attend to Mr. Gillicraft? At last the end came, the long-desired bell tinkled; and whooping, jumping, rioting, out they all rushed into their twelve weeks' freedom. One or two of the lesser girls waited to kiss \"Teacher\" for good-by; then they followed the rest.  When the last child was gone, Mr. Gillicraft approached Jean, who was setting matters straight in her desk. His hand was in his pocket, from which he presently drew a fat leathern wallet.  \"Ahem!\" he said. \"It is my duty and my privilege, too, as I may say, to hand you this, Miss Thompson.\" Mr. Gillicraft called her \"Jean\" usually, having known her all her life, but this was a formal occasion. \"Nine--ten--eleven,\" he went on, counting the bills which he had drawn from his wallet--\"twelve. You will find that correct, I believe, $120, and I desire to say, in the name of the board, that we are quite satisfied with the manner in which you have conducted the school, and gratified at your decision to continue with us during the ensuing year.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" said Jean, modestly.  \"Count it,\" remarked Mr. Gillicraft, dropping the official and resuming the friend--\"always count your money, Jean, it's business-like. And don't put it loose in your pocket--that's a careless trick. You never had so much money at a time before in your life, did you? What are you going to do with it all?\"  \"I don't quite know yet,\" replied Jean, \"I shall have to talk with father about it. I'll lock the door now, Mr. Gillicraft, if you're ready, and give you the key.\"  \"Have you got it?\" whispered her brother James, as Mr. Gillicraft and the key disappeared around the corner. \"Have you got it, Jean?\"  Jean nodded.  \"How splendid,\" said Elsie, a younger sister, coming to Jean's other side. \"Show me. Oh! What a lot of money!\"  \"What will you get with it?\" asked James. \"Don't I wish it was mine! I know well enough what I would buy.\"  \"So do I,\" chimed in Elsie.  \"What?\" said Jean, with a smile.  \"A piano! And the dearest little dog--just like Ruth Parsons's dog, if I could find one. And ever so many books. And a watch.\" And Elsie's list was interrupted by the necessity of taking breath.  \"Hoo! Isn't that just like a girl? Why, you couldn't get half those with that, you silly,\" put in her brother. \"I'd get something quite different. I'd get a pony, a real strong useful pony, which father could plough with when I wasn't riding him. That would be something like.\"  \"Your pony would cost as much as Elsie's piano,\" remarked Jean.  \"Well, what would you get?\" said James. \"Will you get some nice clothes?\"  \"Pshaw! Clothes! Will you get a watch, Jean? Or a breastpin and ear-rings?\"  \"Now, what use would ear-rings be to her when she hasn't any holes in her ears, Elsie? Do tell us, Jean--what will you get?\"  Jean laughed. It seemed as if all the world was bound to find out what she meant to do with her money.  \"I'll tell you by and by,\" she said. \"I've made up my mind, I _think_, what I'd rather do, but I want to talk to father first.\" They reached the top of the hill as she spoke, and she pushed open the gate for the others to enter, paying no attention to Elsie's rather fretful--  \"By and by. That's a long time. Tell us now, Jean, please do.\"  After tea was the best time to catch Farmer Thompson at leisure. At that hour he usually treated himself to half an hour's rest and a pipe in the porch, and there Jean found him on this particular night.  \"Mr. Gillicraft paid me this to-day,\" she said, handing him the roll of bills.  \"Ay. They're prompt with it, but that's but fair. Well, my lass--it's a good bit of money. What'll ye do with your gains?\"  \"I'll tell you something I was thinking of, father--if you approve, that is. It's a great many years since mother and you came from Scotland here, and she's never been home since, you know.\"  \"Twenty-one years come October. 'Tis a long time, truly,\" replied her father, letting a curl of smoke escape from the corner of his mouth.  \"Well--there was an advertisement in the paper, awhile ago, about a steamboat line, the Anchor Line, it's called, I think, which goes to Glasgow, and it said great reductions for this summer, and people could go and come back in the second cabin for forty-five dollars. Now if mother'd like it, and I know she would, she and I could go for what I've got, and she could visit grandmother, and there'd be thirty dollars left for other things, such as going down to New York and from Glasgow to Greenock. Grandmother lives in Greenock, doesn't she? Do you think it's a good plan, father?\"  \"Well, it depends on your mother. If she likes to go, I'd say nought against it,\" replied her father. Then, his habitual Scotch caution relaxing, he added: \"You're a good lass, Jean. A good, dutiful lass to think of this. Your granny's an old woman by now, and I've known this long back that your mother was wearying to see her again before she dies, and I'd have sent her myself, only I never could see the way to do it. Scotland's a long travel, and money's none too plenty now-a-days with any of us. I'll just smoke my pipe out, and then you and I'll go in and talk it over with mother.\"  Mrs. Thompson heard the proposal with a tremulous mixture of bewilderment and joy. She was not a strong woman, and fever-and-ague, that insidious scourge of so many country districts, had struck at the hill-farm the year before, and left her weakened and languid for months afterward. The neighbors were told the new plan, and preparations set on foot at once, that Jean might lose as little as possible of her brief vacation time. Everybody was interested and excited. Mrs. Parsons brought warm knitted hoods to be worn at sea; Mrs. Wright, a waterproof clothes-bag and a box of Ayer's Pills; Mrs. Gillicraft two linen catchalls for state-room use, with pockets, and pincushions well furnished with pins.  \"I envy you,\" said Maria Parsons, who was Jean's special friend. \"I always was wild to travel, but there! I don't suppose I ever shall, so long as I live. Some folks are born lucky. You'll have a splendid time, Jean.\"  \"Do you think so?\" replied Jean, rather dismally.  \"Think so? Why, girl alive, don't you _know_ it?\"  \"Well no, I don't. The fact is, Maria--the fact is--well--I _hate_ travelling. I don't look forward to it one bit. I shall be horribly sick first, and then I shall be horribly homesick: I'm perfectly sure of it. Dear me--how I wish it was over, and we safely back.\"  \"Good gracious!\" cried Maria, opening her eyes. \"What on earth do you go for, Jean, if you feel that way?\"  \"Only to take mother. _She_ wants to go, and I always said she should, if ever I could earn any money to take her. Except for that, I'd gladly give you the chance, and stay at home instead.\"  This was not a very bright beginning for so long a journey. But Jean did not think about that. She had the sturdy old Scotch blood in her, and having once put her hand to a task, did not look back.  Her expectations were realized so far as the voyage went, for they had a rough passage, and both she and her mother were sick for more than half the way over. It was dull work enough for a strong, active girl to lie day after day in a narrow berth, watching the curtains swing and the vessel rock, and very often Jean said to herself, \"I can't imagine what people want to go to Europe for. It's _horrid_! I only wish Maria were in my place--since she wanted to come so much, and I at home instead. I'm sure I'd change in a minute, if I could.\"  Matters mended toward the last, and by the time the steamer entered the Frith of Clyde, Mrs. Thompson, as well as Jean, was able to be on deck. It was a fine day, and as they slowly steamed up the beautiful Frith, between richly cultivated shores, with wooded hills dotted with country-seats rising behind, and purple mountain outlines still farther back, something new stirred in Jean's mind, a quite unlooked-for excitement and pleasure, which roused and woke her mind to the glad reception of fresh impressions. It was the first reward of her unselfishness, but she had looked for no reward, and had been conscious of no unselfishness; so it came with the zest of unexpectedness, and was doubly delightful.  \"Mother, there's a castle!\" she exclaimed. \"I truly think it's a real castle. It looks just like the pictures of them.\"  \"And what for no?\" replied her mother, whose Scotch seemed to revive and broaden with the very aspect of her native shores--\"what for should it na' be a castle? Mony's the castle I've seen in my childish time. Oh! there's the Cathedral, Jean, and the Custom House, and the bonny Monument. I weel remember them a', lang as 'tis. And there--Jean, see by the pillar--I'm most sure that's your uncle Andrew. I know him by the bonny shoulders, and the head above everybody else's; but dear, he's grown much older since--much older.\"  This was no unnatural result of twenty-one years of separation, but at that moment Mrs. Thompson did not remember this. \"It's like a dream,\" she kept on repeating. \"This is Glasgow, and that's my brother that I never looked to see again! It's like a dream, Jean.\"  If they had turned back then and there for thirteen more days of weary sea, Jean would have felt rewarded for her journey by the half-tearful rapture which shone in her mother's face at that moment. But they did not turn back. They landed instead, and, with Uncle Andrew's assistance, were soon in the train for Greenock. He and his sister plunged at once into conversation in Scotch so much broader than Jean was used to, that she could hardly follow it. So she looked out of the window instead of talking, and there was plenty there to keep both eyes and mind happily busy. The trees, the buildings, the silver links and windings of the Frith, the pearl-gray shimmering atmosphere which enveloped all--it was unlike anything she had ever seen, and gave her a pleasure which she had not expected to feel.  Grandmother's house, or flat, was in an old-fashioned street. It was rather barely furnished to American eyes, but very clean and orderly, and there was nothing bare in the greeting given by the sweet-faced old Scotchwoman to her long-unseen child and that child's child. Jean was amused to hear her mother spoken to as if she were still almost a baby, while to herself granny accorded a certain respect and distance as to a stranger and a woman grown. Her size and age seemed an entire surprise to her Scotch relations, who had apparently never realized a growth of which they had only heard in letters.  \"She's a big hearty lass, indeed, she's a very goodly lass!\" granny kept on saying. \"She's as large for a maiden as Sandy is for a lad. Aweel, I can't understand it, Maggie. Ye were always the least of my weans, always the wee one of the flock, and it's muckle strange that your lass should be bigger than ony of her cousins, and your sisters all bigger than yersel. I'm clear puzzled about it.\"  But puzzlement was lost in pleasure when she understood that the whole journey was the gift of Jean, the earnings of a year's hard work. She took the girl into her arms, held her tight, and kissed her heartily.  \"She who goes a mithering shall find violets in the lanes,\" she said, quoting the pretty old English proverb. \"Ye'll find it so, my dear lassie. Ye'll be the richer all your life for giving your mither and me the chance of meeting again once more on this side the grave, trust me, Jean, ye will.\"  \"I'm richer already, granny,\" whispered Jean, warmed through and through by the words and the embrace. There was no stiffness between her and grandmother after that. So granny's love was the first thing bought with Jean's money.  \"Sandy\" was Uncle Andrew's son. His mother had long been dead, and he and his father lived with granny in her flat. He was a manly young fellow, steady and cheery both, and doing well as clerk in one of the large Greenock shipping-houses, with good chances of promotion. The advent of a cousin from America was an event in his life. He liked Jean at once and Jean liked him, so they grew friends speedily.  Under his guidance, Jean's \"violet\" gathering went on prosperously. There were many interesting things to see and do in the neighborhood of Greenock, and of Glasgow, to which place they ran down more than once in a cheap train. There were rows on the Frith, and walks into the lovely hill country, and visits to the different aunts and cousins, all of whom wanted to see Mrs. Thompson and make acquaintance with Jean, and once they went as far as Edinburgh with third-class return tickets, and Jean saw the wonders of Holyrood, the Castle, and Arthur's Seat. It seemed to put new color and life into history and all the past, this glimpse of the places where great things had happened. Jean's interest in books waked up, and as Sandy owned a share in a good People's Library, she was able to get at various histories and fictions which, read on the spot, had a value and meaning which they could not have had elsewhere. Her mind broadened, she took in more of the width and grasp of life, and this mental growth and stimulus was another thing--and a very good one--bought with Jean's money.  So the short two months sped swiftly away, and the time came to go back. It was a hard parting, as partings must be, where seas roll between, and old age makes fresh meetings improbable. But with all its hardness, all of them felt that it had been blessed to meet. Sandy was even more cast down than granny, but he consoled himself by a long whispered talk with Jean the last evening, in which he promised to come out to America in two years from then; and Jean, I am inclined to think, half promised to go back again to Scotland with him. But this is neither here nor there in our story, and, as we all know, it is not polite to listen when people whisper. So the travellers sailed again over the wide Atlantic, the journey not seeming half so long or so hard, now that their faces were set the other way; and in a very few days after the homecoming, all they had seen and done began to recede into dream-like distance, and they found it almost impossible to realize that they had gone so far and achieved so much.  \"I told you you would enjoy it,\" remarked Maria Parsons. People always enjoy being able to say \"I told you so.\"  \"And is your money really all gone?\" said little Elsie, \"every bit of it gone! And you haven't got one single thing of your own to keep out of it, Jean. What a pity!\"  \"Ah, but I have,\" replied Jean. But she made no answer to the further \"What?\"  \"Elsie is sorry that I've spent all my money,\" she told her father that night. \"She doesn't think I got much for it. But it seems to me no one else ever got so much as I have. I never thought I should learn to like travelling, father, but I did; I enjoyed it ever so much. Then I know granny now, and Uncle Andrew, and I've seen a great deal of Scotland, and mother is so much stronger, and we have so many nice things to remember and think about--that's a great, great deal to get with a hundred and twenty dollars, don't you think so, father? And besides--\"  But here Jean stopped and blushed. I think that blush meant--Sandy.     HOW THE STORKS CAME AND WENT.   WHEN the storks came, the spring came too. Till then the skies had been gray and the air cold and raw, while the leaf-buds on the branches seemed afraid to peep from their coverings. But when the call of the storks was heard, and the click of their large white wings, the leaves took courage, unrolled their woolly blankets, and presently the trees were green. Soon other birds came too. The doves went to housekeeping in their cote under the peak of the roof-gable. Just beneath, a pair of swallows built a nest of plastered clay: the cherry-tree in the garden was chosen as home by a colony of lively sparrows. All the air was astir with wings and songs, and the world, which for months had seemed dead or asleep, waked suddenly into life and motion.  \"What a droll house Mother Stork seems to be building!\" said the saucy swallow, cocking up one eye at the long-legged pair on the roof above. \"I shouldn't like such an one at all. Sharp sticks everywhere, no conveniences, great holes for eggs to drop into and be broken. And how the wind must blow up there! Give me a cosey place like this of ours.\"  \"Give _me_ a nice, smooth wooden box,\" cooed the dove. \"I don't fancy plaster; it's damp and rheumatic, my mate says. But you needn't worry about Mother Stork's eggs. They're too large to drop through the holes in the branches and be broken.\"  \"What coarse things they must be!\" remarked the swallow, looking complacently at the tiny clouded spheres beneath her own wings.  \"They _are_ big,\" agreed the dove. \"But then, Mother Stork is big too.\"  \"Listen to those absurd creatures!\" said Mother Stork to her partner. \"Coarse, indeed! My eggs! I like that.\"  \"Never mind them,\" replied Papa Stork, good-humoredly, giving a crooked twig the final shove to the side of the nest.  Below on the grass, which was still winter-brown, three little children stood gazing wistfully up at the storks.  \"They flew straight to our roof,\" said Annchen. \"Frau Perl says that means good luck before the year ends.\"  \"What does good luck mean?\" asked Carl, the youngest boy.  \"It means--oh, all sorts of things,\" replied Annchen, vaguely: \"that the mother should not work so hard; that we should have plenty,--plenty to eat every day,--and money, I suppose,--and my new shoes I've waited for so long;--all sorts of things.\"  \"Perhaps my father'll come back,\" suggested Fritz, with a joyful leap.  Annchen shook her brown head. The boys were too little to understand, but she knew well that the father would never come back. She recollected the day when he marched away with the other soldiers to fight the French. He had lifted her in his arms. She had played with his beard and kissed him, and Fritz had cried after the glittering helmet-spike, till at last the father took the helmet off and gave it him to play with. Then the drum-tap sounded, and he had to go. The mother had watched awhile from the window, and when she could no longer see anything, had sat down to sob and cry with her apron over her face. Annchen recollected it perfectly, and that other dreadful day when Corporal Spes of the same regiment had come, with his arm tied up and a bandage round his head, to tell how the father had been shot in one of the battles before Paris, and buried in French soil. Everything had been sad since. There was less black bread at dinner-time, less soup in the pot, sometimes no soup at all, and the mother worked all day and far into the night, and cried bitterly when she thought the children were not looking. Annchen was too young to comprehend the full cause of these tears, but she _felt_ the sadness; it was like a constant cloud over her childish sun. Now the stork was come to their roof, which all the neighbors said meant something good. Perhaps the happy days would begin again.  \"How I hope they will!\" she whispered to herself.  \"Hope who will?\" asked the mother, passing behind with an armful of wood.  Annchen felt abashed.  \"The storks,\" she murmured. \"Frau Perl said when they build on a roof it brings good fortune always.\" The mother sighed.  \"There is no good fortune for us any more,\" she said sadly. \"Even the dear stork cannot undo what is done.\"  \"But aren't the storks lucky birds?\" asked Fritz. \"Jan Stein said they were.\"  \"Ah, luck, luck!\" answered the mother. \"That is a word only. People use it, but what does it mean?\"  \"Isn't there any luck, then?\" asked Annchen.  \"There is the good God, dear,--that is better,\" replied the mother, and carried her wood into the house.  \"Jan said the stork was God's bird,\" observed little Carl.  \"That's it,\" said Annchen, brightening. \"God's bird; and the good God may let the stork bring us good fortune. Dear storkie, do! If only you would!\"  Mamma Stork looked solemnly down on the children, and wagged her head gravely up and down. Annchen thought it was in answer to her appeal.  \"See, Fritz! see, Carl! She says she will!\" The stork kept on nodding, and Annchen went in to supper, feeling happy.  Days grew into weeks, and spring into full summer. The big eggs and the little eggs had in turn cracked and given place to young birds, who sat in the nests clamoring for food, and being fed, caressed, and kept warm by their mothers. At first the nestlings were ugly, featherless creatures, and seemed all beaks and appetites; but presently they began to grow, to put out plumage, and become round and fat. Soon they could hop; then they could flutter their wings; the air was full of their calls and their swift-moving bodies. Mother Stork's babies were white like herself, and had long legs and big bills. The swallow thought them awkward, and contrasted them proudly with her own brisk, glancing brood; but in Mother Stork's eyes they were perfect in every way, and graceful as birds should be. The dove thought the same of her plump squabs,--each parent was entirely satisfied with the kind of child which the Lord had sent her; and that was a happy thing, was it not?  Summer was over, and now it was September, but Annchen had not ceased to hope for the good fortune which the stork's coming prophesied. Each morning, when she woke, she ran to the window to see if the lucky birds were still in the nest. There they were, but nothing else happened, and the mother worked harder than ever, and the black loaf grew smaller. Still Annchen hoped.  \"Do you notice what a kind bird the stork is?\" said the mother one night, as she was putting the children to bed. \"She never gets tired of taking care of her babies, nor beats them with her wings, nor scolds them. Do you not love her for being so amiable?\"  \"Sometimes the babies scold her,\" remarked Fritz from his corner.  \"I don't think that is scolding. What they say is, 'Mother, we are hungry. We want a fish or a couple of young frogs; when will the father bring them?' The little storks do not like to wait for their dinners any more than you children do. I heard once a story about a good Mother Stork. Shall I tell it you?\"  \"Oh, yes!\" cried the children; but the mother went first for her knitting-work, for even at the twilight hour she dared not let her fingers be idle for a moment.  \"Once there was a Frau Stork,\" she began, \"who built a nest in the roof of an old shed, and in it laid three blue eggs. Presently out of the eggs came three baby storks, large and hungry. Then was Frau Stork very proud and glad. All day she sat in the nest, keeping her little ones warm under her feathers, while Papa Stork flew to and fro, seeking places where were ponds with fish and frogs; and these he fetched home in his beak, and with them fed his brood, who sat always with open mouths ready for anything good which should come along.  \"One day when Papa Stork was absent, and Mother Stork had hopped from the nest to the roof, she heard a crackling sound which she did not at all understand. Then the air grew thick and smoky, and there was a smell of burning wood. The shed was on fire! Frau Stork became uneasy, and called loudly for her mate, but he was too far away to hear her voice. Presently the smoke became more dense, and a little red tongue of flame crept through the thatch. When it felt the air it grew large, swelled, and at last, like a fiery serpent, darted at the nest and the screaming brood within.\"  \"Oh dear! oh dear!\" cried the children, sitting up in their beds. \"What _did_ the poor stork do?\"  \"She could easily have flown away, you know,\" continued the mother. \"There were her strong wings, which would have borne her faster than the fire could follow. But she loved her babies too well to leave them like that. She seized them with her beak, and tried to drag them from the nest. But they were too heavy, and flapped and struggled, hindering her, for they did not understand what she wished to do. The flames drew nearer, the branches began to blaze. Then Mother Stork took her usual place in the nest, gathered her brood under her wings as if to shield them, bent her poor head, and--\"  \"Oh, she didn't burn up!--please don't say she did!\" interrupted Annchen.  \"Yes. When Papa Stork came from the pond with a fresh fish in his beak, there was no roof there, no nest, no little storks,--only a heap of ashes and curling smoke. Frau Stork loved her children too well to desert them, and they all died together.\"  There was silence for a minute or two. Annchen was sobbing softly, and a suspicious sniff was heard from the direction of Fritz's pillow.  \"I hope _our_ stork won't burn up,\" said Carl, solemnly.  \"Yes,--because then she won't bring us good luck, you know,\" added Fritz.  \"Do you think the stork has forgotten?\" whispered Annchen to her mother. \"I've waited and waited for her so long that I'm tired. Do they forget sometimes?\"  \"She will have to bestir herself if she is to do anything for us this year,\" said the mother; and though her heart was heavy enough just then, she smiled into Annchen's eager eyes. \"Autumn is here; the winter will come before long. Frau Stork and her family may fly off any day.\"  \"I shall _have_ to remind her,\" murmured Annchen, sleepily.  She remembered this resolution next morning, and went out into the yard. The day was chilly; the blue sky, all dappled with gray, looked as if a storm were coming. Mother Stork was alone on the roof. Her young ones could fly now, and they and their father were off somewhere together.  \"Mother Stork,\" said Annchen, standing close to the wall, and speaking in a loud, confidential whisper, \"you won't forget what you promised, will you--that day when you nodded your head, you know? The mother says you will fly away soon, but please bring us our good luck first. Poor mother works so hard and looks so pale, and sometimes there is almost no dinner at all, and the cold winter is coming, and I don't know what we shall do, if you don't help us. Please do, Mother Stork. We can't wait till you come again, it's such a long time. Pray fetch our good luck before you go.\"  Mother Stork, perched on one leg on the roof's edge, nodded her head up and down, as if considering the point. Then she rose on her large wings and flew away. Annchen marked her course through the air, and her eyes grew large and eager with delight.  \"She has gone to the fen!\" she cried. \"That's where she keeps it. Oh, the dear stork!\"  \"What is it? Who has gone where?\" asked the boys, running into the yard.  \"Frau Stork,\" explained Annchen. \"I reminded her about it,--our good luck, you know,--and she flew straight off to fetch it. She went to the fen, the beautiful fen, where I went once with the father--_such_ a place! How I should like to go there again! You never saw such a place, boys!\"  \"I want to go to the fen too,\" said Carl.  \"I wonder if we might!\" went on Annchen, thoughtfully. \"It isn't so very far. I didn't get tired at all that day when I went before. And we could help Frau Stork, perhaps. I wonder if we might.\"  \"I'll go in and ask the mother,\" said Fritz, running to the door with an eager demand: \"Mother, may we go for a walk,--Annchen and Carl and I?\"  The mother, who was very busy, nodded.  \"Don't go too far,\" she called after him.  \"Mother says we may,\" shouted Fritz, as he ran again into the yard; and the children, overjoyed, set forth at once.  It was quite a distance to the fen, but the road was a plain one, and Annchen had no difficulty in following it. When she went there before, not only her father had been along, but Ernst the wood-cutter, with his donkey; so, when tired, she had rested herself by riding on top of the fagots. She was three years older now, and the sturdy lads did not mind the distance at all, but ran forward merrily, encouraging each other to make haste.  The sun had broken through the clouds, and shone hotly on the white road. But as they neared the fen, they passed into shade. Softly they lifted the drooping branches of the trees, and entered, moving carefully, that they might not disturb the stork. A little farther, and the ground grew wet under foot. Bright streams of water appeared here and there. But between the streams were ridges and island-like tufts of moss and dried grasses, and stepping from one of these to the other, the little ones passed on, dry-shod. Tall reeds and lance-shaped rushes rose above their heads as they crept along, whispering low to each other. The air was hushed and warm, there was a pleasant fragrance of damp roots and leaves. The children liked the fen extremely. Their feet danced and skipped, and they would gladly have shouted, had it not been for the need of keeping quiet.  Suddenly a beautiful glossy water-rat, with a long tail, glanced like a ray of quick sunshine from under a bank, and at sight of the intruders flashed back again into his hole. Fritz was enchanted at this sight. He longed to stay and dig into the bank in search of the rat. What fun it would be to take him home and tame him! But Annchen whispered imploringly, and Carl tugged at his fingers; so at last he gave up searching for the rat, and went on with the others. They were near the middle of the fen now, and Mother Stork, they thought, must be close at hand.  Pop! glug! An enormous bull-frog leaped from a log, and vanished into the pool with a splash. Next a couple of lovely water-flies, with blue, shining bodies and gauze-like wings, appeared hovering in the air. They rose and sank and circled and whirled like enchanted things; the children, who had never seen such flies before, felt as if they had met the first chapter of a fairy-story, and stood holding their breaths, lest the pretty creatures should take alarm and fly away. It was not till the water-flies suddenly whirled off and disappeared, that they recollected their errand, and moved on.  All at once Annchen, who was in advance of the rest, stopped short and uttered an exclamation. The parting of the reeds had shown her a pool larger than any they had seen before, round which grew a fringe of tall flowering water-plants. Half in, half out of the pool, lay a black log with a hollow end, and beside it, dabbling with her beak as if searching for something, stood a large white bird. At the sound of voices and rustling feet, the bird spread a pair of broad wings and flew slowly upward, turning her head to look at the children as she went.  \"It _was_,\" cried Annchen. \"Oh, Mother Stork, we didn't mean to frighten you. Please come back again. We'll go away at once if you don't like to have us here.\"  But Mother Stork was no longer visible. She had dropped into some distant part of the fen--where, the children could not see.  \"Her eyes looked angry,\" said little Carl.  \"Oh dear!\" sighed Annchen. \"I hope she isn't angry. That _would_ be dreadful! What will poor mother do if she is? And it would be all our fault.\"  \"I want to go home,\" whined Carl. \"It's dinner-time. I want my dinner very much.\"  All of them wanted to go home, but it was not an easy or quick task to do so. The children had wandered farther than they knew. It took a long time to find their way out of the fen, and when at last they reached the rushy limits, and stood on open ground, it was an unfamiliar place, and much farther from home than the side where they had entered. Weary, hungry, and disheartened, they trudged along for what to them seemed hours, and it was long past midday when at last they reached the familiar gate.  Frau Stork had got there before them, and stood on the roof beside her mate, gazing down as the sorry little procession filed beneath. Annchen had no heart to greet her as she passed. She was tired, and a dread lest their long absence should have frightened or angered the mother added weight to her fatigue, and made her heart sink heavily as they opened the door.  The mother did not start or run forward to meet them as the children expected she would do. She sat by the table, and some one sat opposite her--a tall, stately officer in uniform, with an order on his breast. His helmet lay on the table, with some papers scattered about it. When the children came in, he turned and looked at them out of a pair of kind blue eyes.  \"Ah,\" he said. \"These are the little ones, dame?\"  \"Yes,\" said the mother, \"these are _his_ children. Take off your hats, boys; and, Annchen, make your reverence. This is the Herr Baron, your father's captain, children.\"  [Illustration: The Captain lifted Fritz and perched him on his knee.--PAGE 296.]  Carl stared with round eyes at the splendid Herr Baron, while Annchen demurely dropped her courtesy. The captain lifted Fritz and perched him on his knee.  \"My fine fellow,\" he said, \"you have your father's face,\"--and he stroked Fritz's yellow hair, while Fritz played with the bright buttons of the uniform. The captain and the mother went on talking. Annchen did not understand all they said, but she saw that her mother looked happier than for a long time before, and that made her feel happy too.  At last the captain rose to go. He kissed the children, and Annchen saw him put a purse into her mother's hands.  \"I take shame to myself that I left you so long without aid,\" he said; \"but keep up heart, dame. Your pension will no doubt be granted you, and I will see that you and the children are cared for, as a brave man's family should be. So good-day, and God bless you!\"  \"May He bless you, Herr Baron,\" sobbed the widow, as he went away.  \"What is it, mother,--why do you cry?\" asked little Carl at last, pulling her sleeve.  \"For joy, dear. The good Baron has brought your father's back pay. I can discharge my debts now, and you need hunger no more.\"  \"It is the good luck come at last. I knew it would,\" said Annchen.  \"We will thank God for it,\" said her mother. And they all knelt down and repeated \"Our Father,\" that beautiful prayer which suits equally our time of joy and our time of sorrow.  But when the prayer was said, and the mother, smiling through her tears, was bustling about to cook such a supper as the little family had not tasted for many a day, dear, superstitious little Annchen stole softly to the door and went into the yard.  The young storks were asleep with their heads under their wings, and Frau Stork, poised on one leg, was gazing about with drowsy eyes. She looked bigger than ever against the dim evening sky.  \"Thank you, dear stork!\" said Annchen.\n\n"

ONE STORMY NIGHT.   \"Mother, we're afloat agin.\" It was a gruff, sleepy voice that spoke, and the old fisherman turned over and snored on, as though the fact of their home being afloat was of no consequence to him. His wife, however, was by no means so easy in her mind, for it was only during the equinoctial gales and an unusually high tide that their home was lifted from its moorings; and now it had been swinging and swaying for hours, and the rusty chains that held it fast to some posts were creaking and straining as though the next gust of wind would certainly carry them out to sea or drive them up the river, where they would inevitably be swamped in a very short time, for their boat-home was leaky at the bottom--had been a water-logged boat before the fisherman took possession of it and turned it into a quaint-looking cottage by running up some wooden walls along the sides, and roofing it in with planks and tarpaulin. Thus converted into a dwelling-house, the boat had been secured, by four chains fixed to posts in the ground, on the top of a mud-bank that formed the boundary of the mouth of the river.  The ocean itself was less than a quarter of a mile from where the old boat was moored, and so the poor woman might well be excused for growing more alarmed as the minutes went on and the gale increased, until the boat fairly rocked, and the children in the adjoining cabin began crying and screaming in their fright.  \"Coomber! Coomber!\" she said at last, shaking her husband, and starting up in bed; for a sound more dreadful than the children's screams had made itself heard above the din of the wind and waves.  \"There's a ship, Coomber, close in shore; I can hear the guns!\" screamed his wife, giving him another vigorous shake.  \"Ship! guns!\" exclaimed the old fisherman, starting up in bed. The next minute he was on his feet, and working himself into his clothes. \"She must be on the sand-bar if you heard the guns,\" he said.  A sudden lurch of the boat almost pitched the old man forward, and the children's screams redoubled, while Mrs. Coomber hastily scrambled out of bed and lighted the lantern that hung against the wall.  \"What are yer going to do?\" asked her husband, in some surprise; \"women ain't no good in such work as this.\"  \"What are you going to do?\" asked Mrs. Coomber, almost crying herself; \"the boat will soon be adrift with this wind and tide, and we shall all be drowned like rats in a hole.\"  \"Nay, nay, old woman, the boat was made taut enough before I brought you here, and you think she wouldn't have broke away before this if she was going to do it? Don't be a stupid lubber,\" he added.  \"But the children, Coomber, the children. I ain't afraid for myself,\" said the mother, with a sob.  \"Well, well, the old boat'll hold the boys for many a day yet,\" said the fisherman; \"you go in and stop their noise, while I get help for the poor souls that are surely perishing out there.\"  \"But what can you do for them?\" asked his wife; \"there ain't a boat besides ours at Bermuda Point, nor a man to help you manage it besides Bob.\"  \"No, no; Bob and I couldn't manage the boat in such a sea as this; but he shall go with me to Fellness. Bob! Bob!\" called his father, in the same breath.  \"Aye, aye,\" came an answering shout from the adjoining cabin.  \"Slip into your things as quick as you can; we must be off to Fellness; there's a ship out there on the bar sands.\"  \"I'm a'most ready, dad; I heard mother call yer, and thought you'd let me go along,\" replied Bob.  Before the fisherman put on his sou'-wester he took a black bottle from a recess, and after taking a hearty draught, he said, \"It's lucky we've got a drop to-night,\" as he handed it to his wife; and with a parting word to her not to be afraid, he and Bob stepped out of the boat-house door, to meet the full fury of the blast, that threatened at first to carry them off their legs. The three miles' walk to the little fishing village of Fellness was no easy task such a wild night as this, for although the road was inland, it was fully exposed to the sea, and between the wilder outbreaks of the wind and rain they could hear the guns of distress, and occasionally see a rocket piercing the midnight blackness of the sky, appealing for help for the drowning men.  At the coastguard station, midway between the Point and the village, they found the men on the alert, and two volunteered to go with Coomber and help man the boat. Then the four plodded silently along the slushy road, for talking was next to impossible in such a gale, and it needed all the strength and energy they could muster to fight the wind and rain.  They made their way to the beach as soon as they reached Fellness, and, as they expected, found most of the men gathered there, watching the distressed vessel.  \"Halloo! here's Coomber from the Point,\" said one, as the new-comers pushed their way in among them.  \"What are yer standing here for?\" shouted Coomber, in some impatience; \"looking won't do her no good.\"  \"We can't do nothing else,\" said the man; \"we've got Rodwell's boat here--she's the best craft on this coast for such a trip, and we've made three tries in her, but it's no good; nothing could live in such a sea as this; we've been beat back every time, and well-nigh swamped.\"  \"Well, mates, I don't say nothing but what yer may have tried; but suppose now one of yer had got a boy out in that there ship--_I've_ got a boy in that, or another, if he ain't gone to where there's no more sea,\" said the old fisherman, with a groan; and before he had done speaking, one or two had moved to where the boat had been dragged on to the low sandy shore.  \"We'll try again,\" they said, in quiet but determined voices.  \"Let the youngsters go,\" said Coomber, as two or three married men pressed forward; \"them as has got wives ain't no call to go on such a trip as this. There'll be enough of us; there's me and Bob, and Rook and White came with us a purpose, and----\"  \"But how about your wife, Coomber?\" interrupted one of the men.  \"Oh, never you fear, lads; she'll not grudge me if I save her boy. Now, lads, look here; seven of us'll be enough, and we've got four.\"  There were so many volunteers for the three vacant places, that the men seemed on the point of quarrelling among themselves now for the privilege of joining in this dangerous errand; but by common consent Coomber was constituted the leader of the party, and he chose three of the most stalwart of the single men, and the rest were allowed to run the boat down through the surf. Then, with a loud cheer from all who stood on the shore, the seven brave men bent to their oars, and during a slight lull in the wind, they made a little headway towards the wreck. But the next minute they were beaten back again, and the boat well-nigh swamped. Again they pushed off, but again were they driven back; and five times was this repeated, and thus an hour was lost in the fruitless endeavour to get away from the shore. At length the fury of the storm somewhat abated, and they were able to get away, but it was a long time before they could get near the dangerous bar sands, on which the vessel had struck, and when they did get there, the ship had disappeared. There was plenty of wreckage about--broken spars, fragments of masts and torn sail-cloth.  \"We're too late,\" groaned one of the men, as he peered through the darkness, trying to descry the hull of the vessel. They had not heard the guns or seen a rocket thrown up for some time.  \"They're all gone, poor fellows,\" said another, sadly; \"we may as well go back now, before the gale freshens again.\"  \"Oh, stop a bit; we'll look among this rubbish, and see what there is here; perhaps some of them are holding on to the floating timber,\" said Coomber, who had frequently been out on a similar errand.  They raised their voices together, and cried \"Hi! hi!\" trying to outscream the wind; but it was of no use; there was no answering call for help, and after waiting about for some time, and going as near to the dangerous sands as they dared, they at length reluctantly turned their boat towards the shore, and began to row back. But before they had got far on their way, they descried the gleam of something white floating in front of them.  \"Only a bit of sail-cloth,\" said one, as they paused in their rowing to concentrate all their attention upon the object.  \"Let's make sure, mates,\" said Coomber. \"Steady, now; mind your oars; let her float; it's coming this way, and we'll pick it up;\" and in another minute Coomber had reached over and seized the white bundle, which he found to be carefully lashed to a spar.  \"It's a child!\" he exclaimed. \"Mates, we ain't come out for nothing, after all. Now row for dear life,\" he said, as he carefully laid the bundle in the bottom of the boat. They could do nothing for it here, not even ascertain whether it was dead or alive; and they pulled for the shore with even greater eagerness than they had left it.  The dawn was breaking before they got back, and they were welcomed with a shout from their waiting comrades, who were watching anxiously for the return of the boat. There was disappointment, however, in the little crowd of watchers when they saw only the brave crew returning from the perilous journey.  \"What, nothing!\" exclaimed one of the men, as the boat drew close in shore.  \"Only a child, and that may be dead,\" shouted one of the crew.  \"But I think it's alive,\" said Coomber. \"Run, Peters, and rouse up your missus; the womenfolk are better hands at such jobs than we are;\" and as soon as he could leave the boat, he picked up the white bundle, and hurried after Peters, leaving his companions to tell the story of their disappointment.  Mrs. Peters was a motherly woman, and had already lighted a fire to prepare some breakfast for her husband, in readiness for his return from the beach, so the wet clothes were soon taken off the child, and they saw it was a little girl about five years old, fair and delicate-looking, decently, but not richly clad, with a small silver medal hung round her neck by a black ribbon. At first they feared the poor little thing was dead, for it was not until Mrs. Peters had well-nigh exhausted all her best-known methods for restoring the apparently drowned, that the little waif showed any sign of returning life.  Coomber stood watching with silent but intense anxiety the efforts of the dame to restore animation, not daring to join in the vigorous chafings and slappings administered, for fear his rough horny hands should hurt the tender blue-white limbs.  For some time the woman was too much occupied with her task to notice his presence, but when her labour was rewarded by a faint sigh, and a slightly-drawn breath parted the pale lips, she heard a grunt of satisfaction behind her; and turning her head, she exclaimed, \"What gowks men are, to be sure.\"  \"Eh, what is it, dame?\" said Coomber, meekly; for he had conceived a wonderful respect for Mrs. Peters during the last ten minutes.  \"Ha' you been a-standing there like a post all this while, and never put out yer hand to help save the child?\" she said, reproachingly.  \"I couldn't, dame, I couldn't with such hands as these; but I'll do anything for you that I can,\" whispered the fisherman, as though he feared to disturb the child.  \"Well, I want a tub of hot water,\" snapped Mrs. Peters. \"You'll find the tub in the backyard, and the kettle's near on the boil. Look sharp and get the tub, and then go upstairs and get a blanket off the bed.\"  Coomber soon brought the tub, and a pitcher of cold water that stood near, but it was not so easy for him to grope his way upstairs. The staircase was narrow and dark, and seemed specially contrived that the uninitiated might bump and bruise themselves. Coomber, in his boat-home, having no such convenience or inconvenience in general use, found the ascent anything but easy, and the dame's sharp voice was heard calling for the blanket long before he had groped his way to the bedroom door. But what would he not do for that child whose faint wail now greeted his ears? He pushed on, in spite of thumps and knocks against unexpected corners, and when he had found the blanket, was not long in making his way down with it.  \"Now what's to be done with her?\" demanded the woman, as she lifted the little girl out of the water, and wrapped her in the blanket.  \"Won't she drink some milk?\" said Coomber, scratching his head helplessly.  \"I dessay she will presently; but who's to keep her? You say there ain't none of the people saved from the wreck to tell who she belongs to?\"  \"No, there ain't none of 'em saved, so I think I'll take her myself,\" said Coomber.  \"You take her!\" exclaimed the woman; \"what will your wife say, do you think, to another mouth to fill, when there's barely enough now for what you've got--four hearty boys, who are very sharks for eating?\"  \"Well, dame, I've had a little gal o' my own, but ain't likely to have another unless I takes this one,\" said Coomber, with a little more courage, \"and so I ain't a-going to lose this chance; for I do want a little gal.\"  \"Oh, that's all very well; but you ain't no call to take this child that's no ways your own. She can go to the workus, you know. Peters'll take her by-and-by. Her clothes ain't much, so her belongings ain't likely to trouble themselves much about her. Yer can see by this trumpery medal she don't belong to rich folks; so my advice is, let her go to the workus, where she'll be well provided for.\"  \"No, no! the missus'll see things as I do, when I talk to her a bit. So if you'll take care of her for an hour or two, while I go home and get off these duds, and tell her about it, I'll be obliged;\" and without waiting for the dame's reply, Coomber left the cottage.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER II.  THE FISHERMAN'S HOME.   \"Why, mother, are you here?\" Coomber spoke in a stern, reproachful tone, for he had found his wife and the cowering children huddled together in the corner of the old shed where the family washing and various fish-cleaning operations were usually carried on; and the sight did not please him.  \"Are yer all gone mad that yer sitting out there wi' the rain drippin' on yer, when yer might be dry an' comfortable, and have a bit o' breakfast ready for a feller when he comes home after a tough job such as I've had?\"  \"I--I didn't know when you was coming to breakfast,\" said Mrs. Coomber, timidly, and still keeping close in the corner of the shed for fear her husband should knock her down; while the children stopped their mutual grumblings and complaints, and crept closer to each other behind their mother's skirts.  \"Couldn't you ha' got it ready and waited wi' a bit o' fire to dry these duds?\" exclaimed her husband.  \"But the boat, Coomber, it wasn't safe,\" pleaded the poor woman. \"We might ha' been adrift any minute.\"  \"Didn't I tell yer she was safe, and didn't I ought to know when a boat's safe better nor you--a poor tool of a woman? Come out of it,\" he added, impatiently, turning away.  The children wondered that nothing worse than hard words fell to their share, and were somewhat relieved that the next question referred to Bob, and not to their doings.  \"You say he ain't come home?\" said Coomber.  \"I ain't seen him since he went with you to Fellness. Ain't you just come from there?\" said his wife, timidly.  \"Of course I have, but Bob ought to have been back an hour or so ago, for I had something to do in the village. Come to the boat, and I'll tell you all about it,\" he added, in a less severe tone; for the thought of the child he had rescued softened him a little, and he led the way out of the washing-shed.  The storm had abated now, and the boat no longer rocked and swayed, so that the children waded back through the mud without fear, while their father talked of the little girl he had left with Dame Peters at Fellness. They listened to his proposal to bring her home and share their scanty meals with very little pleasure, and they wished their mother would say she could not have another baby; but instead of this Mrs. Coomber assented at once to her husband's plan of fetching the child from Fellness that afternoon.  The Coombers were not a happy family, for the fisherman was a stern, hard man by nature, and since he had lost his little girl he had become harder, his neighbours said. At all events, his wife and children grew more afraid of him--afraid of provoking his stern displeasure by any of those little playful raids children so delight in; and every one of them looked forward to the day when they could run away from home and go to sea, as their grown-up brother had done. Bob, the eldest now at home, was already contemplating taking this step very soon, and had promised to help Dick and Tom when they were old enough. It had been a startling revelation to Bob to hear his father speak as he had done on the beach at Fellness about his brother, for he had long ago decided that his father did not care a pin for any of them, unless it was for the baby sister who had died, and even of that he was not quite sure. He had made up his mind, as he walked through the storm that morning, that he would not go back again, but make his way to Grimsby, or some other seaport town, after his business at Fellness was done. But what he had heard on the beach from his father somewhat shook his purpose, and when he learned from Dame Peters afterwards, that the child they had rescued was to share their home, he thought he would go back again, and try to bear the hard life a little longer, if it was only to help his mother, and tell her his father did care for them a bit in spite of his stern, hard ways.  Perhaps Mrs. Coomber did not need to be told that her husband loved her and his children; at all events, she received Bob's information with a nod and a smile, and a whispered word. \"Yer father's all right, and a rare good fisherman,\" she said; for in spite of the frequent unkindness she experienced, Mrs. Coomber was very fond of her husband.  \"Ah, he's a good fisherman, but he'd be all the better if he didn't have so much of that bottle,\" grumbled Bob; \"he thinks a deal more about that than he does about us.\"  It was true enough what Bob said. If his father could not by any chance get his bottle replenished, wife and children had a little respite from their usual hard, driving life, and he was more civil to their only neighbours, who were at the farm about half a mile off; but once the bottle got filled again, he grew sullen and morose, or quarrelsome. He had recently made himself very disagreeable to Farmer Hayes in one of his irritable fits, a fact which suddenly recurred to his wife when she heard of the sick child being brought home to her to nurse, but she dared not mention it to her husband. When Coomber brought the child that afternoon, he said, gaily: \"Here's a present for yer from the sea, mother; maybe she'll bring us good luck coming as she did.\"  \"It 'ud be better luck if we'd picked up a boat,\" muttered Bob, who was standing near.  \"Why, she ain't such a baby as you said,\" exclaimed Mrs. Coomber, as she unpinned the shawl in which she was wrapped; \"she is about five.\"  \"Five years old,\" repeated Coomber; \"but she'd talk if she was as old as that, and Dame Peters told me she'd just laid like a dead thing ever since she'd been there.\"  \"She's ill, that's what it is, poor little mite--ill and frightened out of her senses;\" and Mrs. Coomber gathered her in her arms, and kissed the little white lips, and pressed her to her bosom, as only a tender mother can, while the boys stood round in wondering silence, and Coomber dashed a tear from his eye as he thought of the little daughter lying in Fellness churchyard. But he was ashamed of the love that prompted this feeling, and said hastily: \"Now, mother, we mustn't begin by spoiling her;\" but then he turned away, and called Bob to go with him and look after the boat.  For several days the child continued very ill--too ill to notice anything, or to attempt to talk; but one day, when she was lying on Mrs. Coomber's lap before the fire, the boys mutely looking at her as she lay, she suddenly put up her little hands, and said in a feeble whisper, \"Dear faver Dod, tate tare o' daddy and mammy, and Tiny;\" and then she seemed to drop off into a doze.  The boys were startled, and Mrs. Coomber looked down hastily at the little form on her lap, for this was the first intimation they had had that the child could talk, although Mrs. Coomber fancied that she had showed some signs of recognising her during the previous day.  \"I say, did you hear that?\" whispered Dick. \"Was she saying her prayers, mother, like Harry Hayes does?\"  Mrs. Coomber nodded, while she looked down into the child's face and moved her gently to and fro to soothe her to sleep.  \"But, mother, ought she to say that? Did you hear her? She said 'dear God,'\" said Dick, creeping round to his mother's side.  Mrs. Coomber was puzzled herself at the child's words. They had awakened in her a far-off memory of days when she was a girl, and knelt at her mother's knee, and said, \"Our Father,\" before she went to bed. But that was long before she had heard of Bermuda Point, or thought of having boys and girls of her own. When they came she had forgotten all about those early days; and so they had never been taught to say their prayers, or anything else, in fact, except to help their father with the boat, shoot wild-fowl in the winter, and gather samphire on the shore during the summer.  She thought of this now, and half wished she had thought of it before. Perhaps if she had tried to teach her children to pray, they would have been more of a comfort to her. Perhaps Jack, her eldest, would not have run away from home as he did, leaving them for years to wonder whether he was alive or dead, but sending no word to comfort them.  The boys were almost as perplexed as their mother. The little they had heard of God filled them with terror, and so to hear such a prayer as this was something so startling that they could think and talk of nothing else until their father came in, when, as usual, silence fell on the whole family, for Coomber was in a sullen mood now.  The next day Tiny, as she had called herself, was decidedly better. A little bed had been made up for her in the family living-room, and she lay there, quiet but observant, while Mrs. Coomber went about her work--cooking and cleaning and mending, and occasionally stopping to kiss the little wistful face that watched her with such quiet curiosity.  \"Am I in a s'ip now?\" the child asked at length, when Mrs. Coomber had kissed her several times.  \"You're in a boat, deary; but you needn't be afraid; our boat is safe enough.\"  \"I ain't afraid; Dod is tatin' tare of me,\" said the child, with a little sigh.  Mrs. Coomber wondered whether she was thinking of the storm; whether she could tell them who she was, and where her friends might be found; and she ventured to ask her several questions about this, but failed to elicit any satisfactory answer. The child was sleepy, or had forgotten what Mrs. Coomber thought she would be sure to remember; but it was evident she had taken notice of her surroundings during the last few days, for after a little while she said, \"Where's der boys--dat Dick and Tom?\"  Mrs. Coomber was amused. \"They're out in the boat looking after the nets,\" she said.  \"When they toming home?\" asked the little girl; \"home to dis boat, I mean,\" she added.  \"Oh, they'll come soon,\" replied Mrs. Coomber. \"But, now, can't you tell me something about your mother and father, and where you lived, my deary?\" she asked again.  \"I tomed in a s'ip, and 'ou my mammy now,\" said the child, looking round the cosy room with perfect content.  \"But where is your own mammy, who taught you to say your prayers?\" asked Mrs. Coomber.  The tears came into the sweet blue eyes for a minute as she said, \"See dorn up dere, to tay in Dod's house, and Tiny do too if see a dood dal.\"  Mrs. Coomber laid down the jacket she was patching, and kissed the serious little face. \"Is your mother dead, my deary?\" she asked, while the tears shone in her own eyes.  \"See done to see daddy, and tell him about Tiny,\" answered the child; from which Mrs. Coomber gathered that mother and father were both dead; and when her husband came home she told him what she had heard, which seemed to afford the old fisherman a good deal of satisfaction.  \"Then she's ours safe enough, mother,\" he said, rubbing his hands, \"and when she gets well she'll toddle about the old boat like our own little Polly did.\"  \"But I thought you said Peters was going to see the newspaper man to tell him to put something in the _Stamford Mercury_ about finding her, so that her friends should know she was saved, and come and fetch her.\"  \"I said her mother or father,\" interrupted Coomber, sharply; \"but if they're dead, there ain't anybody else likely to want such a little 'un, and so we may keep her, I take it. But Peters shall go to the newspaper man, never fear,\" added Coomber; \"I don't want to rob anybody of the little 'un; but if nobody don't come in a week, why then, Mary----\" and Coomber paused, and looked at his wife.  \"Well, then, I'll get out little Polly's things; they'll just about fit her,\" said Mrs. Coomber, hastily wiping her eyes with her apron for fear her husband should reproach her again for her tears.  When the boys came in, the little girl said, shyly, \"Tome and tell me about the nets.\"  Dick looked at her, and then at his mother.  \"What does she mean?\" he asked, drawing near the little bed where Tiny lay.  \"She wants to know about the fishing,\" said Mrs. Coomber. \"Have you had a good take, Dick?\" asked his mother, rather anxiously, for she wanted some more milk for Tiny, and her little secret store of halfpence was gone now.  \"Oh, it ain't much,\" said Dick; \"Bob has taken a few plaice to Fellness, and I dessay he'll bring back some bread or some flour.\"  \"But I want some milk for the child; she can't eat bread and fish and potatoes now she's ill. Couldn't you run up to the farm, Dick, and ask Mrs. Hayes if she wants a bit o' fish, and I'll be thankful for a drop o' milk for it.\"  But Dick looked dubious. \"I'd like to go,\" he said, \"if it was only to have a word with Harry Hayes, and ask him about his rabbits; but father don't like the farm people now, and he said I was never to speak to them. You know they've had a quarrel.\"  \"Well, what are we to do? They are our only neighbours, and they ain't a bad sort either, Mrs. Hayes is a kind soul, who has children of her own, and would let me have milk in a minute if she knew I wanted it for this poor little mite,\" said Mrs. Coomber, in perplexity as to the best thing to do.  \"I'll go, mother, if you can find any fish worth taking,\" at last said Dick.  Mrs. Coomber went and turned over what the boys had brought. The best had been picked out and sent to Fellness, and what was left was not more than sufficient for themselves; but she carefully looked out the largest she could find and washed it. While she was doing this her husband came in.  \"It's a poor take to-day, mother,\" he said.  \"Yes, and I wanted a bit extra, to get some milk for the child,\" said Mrs. Coomber; \"but I think I can manage with this,\" she said, still busying herself with the fish, and not turning to look at her husband.  \"What are yer goin' to do wi' it?\" he inquired.  \"I want to send Dick up to the farm; Mrs. Hayes will give me some milk for it, I know,\" replied his wife, trying to speak in a matter-of-fact tone.  [Illustration: \"'ME LIKES 'OU,' SHE SAID.\" (_See page 40._)]  \"And you'd send Dick to that place when I said they shouldn't go near the house,\" said her husband, angrily. \"Take the fish and cook it for supper. Not a bit o' my fish shall they have.\"  \"But the milk. What am I to do for the milk for the child now she's ill?\"  \"What have yer done afore?\" demanded her husband; and the poor woman was obliged to confess that she had taken milk from the man as he went past in his cart to the village each day since the child had been there. \"She couldn't do wi'out milk,\" protested Mrs. Coomber.  \"How do you know she couldn't?\" said her husband. \"What business have you to spend money for milk--what business have you wi' money at all?\" he inquired, suspiciously; for he saw in this wastefulness a cause for the recent strange scarcity of whisky; and he felt he had been deeply wronged. His quarrel with Hayes had also been disregarded, and this made him further angry with his wife, and he strictly charged her never to have any more dealings with any of the farm people.  \"We can live very well without milk,\" he said. \"I will feed the little 'un, and you'll see she can eat fish and bread as well as the rest of us.\"  It was useless for Mrs. Coomber to protest against this; she knew if her husband made up his mind to do anything he would do it; but she almost dreaded supper-time coming, for she could not tell how Tiny would like the proposed change in her nurse and diet.  But as it happened the little girl was very pleased to be lifted out of bed and seated on Coomber's knee at the table.  \"Me likes 'ou,\" she said, patting his cheek with her little white hand; and she ate the fish and bread as though she was quite used to such food.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER III.  TINY'S HOPE.   The slant rays of the setting sun lay on the wide stretch of level sand surrounding Bermuda Point, for the tide was out, and had left it smooth, or slightly rippled as with tiny wavelets. Standing at the very edge of the sands, with her eyes shaded, and her clothes blowing round her bare legs, was a little fair-haired girl. She was slender and delicate-looking still, in spite of the sun-browned arms and face. Months had passed, but Tiny was still at the Point.  She stood gazing seawards for some minutes, and then turned and walked slowly across the rippled sand.  \"I can't see him, Dick,\" she said, in a disappointed tone.  \"Oh, well, never mind,\" said the boy, who sat scooping the loose sand up in a heap, beyond the reach of the present ordinary tides.  \"Have you filled both the baskets?\" asked the little girl, as she waded through the loose dry sand to where the boy was sitting.  \"No, that I ain't,\" answered Dick, \"mother said you could pick the samphire to-day.\"  \"Yes, but you said you'd help me,\" said the girl, walking steadily across the sand to the salt-marsh beyond. Here the samphire grew in abundance, and the little girl set to work to fill the two large baskets that stood near.  \"You might come and help, Dick,\" she called, hardly repressing a sob as she spoke.  \"Look here, I'll help if you'll just come and make some more of them letters. You said you would, you know,\" added the boy, still piling up the sand.  \"Oh, Dick, you know I can't; you know I've forgot a'most everything since I've been here;\" and this time the little girl fairly burst into tears, and sat down beside the half-filled baskets, and sobbed as though her heart would break.  The boy's heart was touched at the sight of her distress, and he ran across to comfort her.  \"Don't cry, Tiny; I'll help yer, and then we'll try agin at the letters. I know three--A B C: you'll soon find out about the others, and make 'em in the sand for me.\"  But Tiny shook her head. \"I'd know 'em if I had a book,\" she said, sadly; \"ain't it a pity daddy ain't got one?\"  \"What 'ud be the good of books to dad?\" said Dick. \"Harry Hayes has got some, I know; but then he goes to school, and knows all about 'em. There, let's forget we see him with that book yesterday, for it ain't no good for us to think about it,\" concluded Dick; for he did not like to see Tiny's tears, and the easiest way of banishing them was to forget the original cause, he thought. But the little girl was not of the same opinion. She shook her head sadly as she said--  \"I've forgot a'most everything my mother told me.\"  \"Oh, that you ain't,\" contradicted the boy, \"You never forget to say your prayers before you go to bed. I wonder you ain't forgot that; I should, I know.\"  \"How could you, Dick, if you knew God was waiting to hear you?\" said Tiny, lifting her serious blue eyes to his face.  \"Then why ain't He waiting to hear me?\" asked Dick.  The question seemed to puzzle the little girl for a minute or two; but at length she said--  \"He is, Dick, I think; I'm a'most sure He's waiting for yer to begin.\"  \"Then He's waited a good while,\" said Dick, bluntly; and he got up and began to pull away at the samphire, by way of working off or digesting the wonderful thought. After working away in silence for some minutes, Dick said--  \"D'ye think God cares for us down here at Bermuda Point?\"  Tiny paused, with her hands full of samphire.  \"Why shouldn't He?\" she said. \"I know He cares for me. He loves me,\" she added, in a tone of triumph; \"my mother told me so. She said He loved me just as well as she did.\"  \"I'd like to know whether He cares about me,\" said Dick. \"D'ye think yer could find out for us, Tiny? Yer see everybody likes you--mother, and father, and Bob; and Harry Hayes showed you his book yesterday. You see you're a gal, and I think you're pretty,\" added Dick, critically; \"so it 'ud be a wonder if He didn't like you.\"  \"And why shouldn't He love you, Dick?\" said Tiny.  Dick looked down at the patched, ragged, nondescript garments that served him as jacket and trousers, and then at his bare, sunburnt arms and legs. \"Well, I'm just Dick of the Point. I ain't a gal, and I ain't pretty.\" Nobody could dispute the latter fact, which Dick himself seemed to consider conclusive against any interest being taken in him, for he heaved a sigh as he returned to his work of picking the samphire.  The sigh was not lost on Tiny. \"Look here, Dick,\" she said, \"you ain't a gal, and p'r'aps you ain't pretty, but I love you;\" and she threw her arms round his neck as he stooped over the basket. \"I love yer, Dick, and I'll find out all about it for yer. I'm a'most sure God loves yer too.\"  \"Oh, He can't yet, yer know,\" said Dick, drawing his arms across his eyes to conceal the tears that had suddenly come into them. \"I don't never say no prayers nor nothing. I ain't never heerd about Him, only when dad swears, till you come and said your prayers to Him.\"  \"Still, He might, yer know,\" said Tiny; \"but if you'll help, I'll find out all about it.\"  \"What can yer do?\" asked Dick.  \"Well, I'll tell yer why I want dad to come home soon to-night,\" said Tiny, resting her hands on the basket, and looking anxiously across the sea. \"Mother said he'd take the samphire by boat to Fellness, and I thought perhaps he'd take me too.\"  \"Well, s'pose he did?\" said Dick, who could see no connection between a visit to the village and the attainment of the knowledge they both desired.  \"Why, then I might get a book,\" said Tiny. \"I'd go with dad to sell the samphire; and then we'd see the shops; and if he had a good take, and we got a lot of samphire, he'd have enough money to buy me a book, as well as the bread and flour and tea.\"  Dick burst into a loud laugh. \"So this is your secret; this is what you've been thinking of like a little goose all day.\"  Tiny was half offended. \"You needn't laugh,\" she said; \"I shall do it, Dick.\"  \"Will yer?\" he said, in a teasing tone. \"If there wasn't no whisky, and there was bookshops at Fellness, you might. Why, what do you think the village is like?\" he asked.  \"Like? Oh, I dunno! Everything comes from Fellness,\" added the little girl, vaguely.  To the dwellers at the Point, the little fishing-village was the centre of the universe; and Tiny, with faint recollections of a large town, with broad streets, and rows of shops all brilliantly lighted at night, had formed magnificently vague notions of Fellness as being something like this; and she had only got to go there, and it would be easy to coax the old fisherman to buy her a book, as she coaxed him to build her a castle in the sand, or take her on his knee and tell her tales of ships that had been wrecked on the bar sands.  \"But do you know what Fellness is like?\" persisted Dick. \"There ain't no shops at all--only one, where they sells flour, and bread, and 'bacca, and tea, and sugar, and soap. They has meat there sometimes; but I never sees no books, and I don't believe they ever has 'em there,\" concluded the boy.  \"Perhaps they keeps 'em in a box where you can't see 'em,\" suggested Tiny, who was very unwilling to relinquish her hope.  \"Pigs might fly, and they will when they sells books at Fellness,\" remarked Dick.  \"Where does Harry Hayes get his from?\" suddenly asked the girl; and at the same moment she espied a speck on the horizon, which she decided was a fisherman's boat. \"He's coming, Dick, dad's coming,\" she exclaimed. \"Make haste--make haste and fill up the baskets;\" and she tore away at the seaweed, piling it into the baskets as fast as her small hands would permit. \"Now we'll carry one down,\" she said, taking hold of the handle. \"Catch hold, Dick;\" for she wanted to be at the edge of the sands by the time the boat touched the shore.  But Dick was in no such hurry to meet his father. \"There's plenty of time,\" he said, leisurely untying a knot in a piece of string.  \"No there isn't, Dick; don't you know I'm going to Fellness in the boat.\"  \"But you're afraid,\" said the boy; \"ain't father tried to coax you lots o' times to go out with him, and yer never would? You'll just get to the edge, and when yer sees it rock a bit yer'll run away.\"  \"No, I won't, Dick, this time,\" said the little girl. But as she spoke a shiver of fear and dread ran through her frame at the thought of the swaying boat.  Dick saw it, and laughed. \"Didn't I tell yer you was afraid,\" he said, in a mocking tone; \"what's the good of going down there, when you're frightened?\"  \"But I want a book, Dick; I must learn to read, and find out what we want to know. Oh, do make haste!\" she added, as she saw the boat approaching the shore.  Dick was still laughing, but he helped her carry the basket, though he teased her as they went along about being frightened. They got across the sands with their samphire, just as Coomber and Bob were springing ashore.  \"Oh, daddy, take me with yer to Fellness,\" called Tiny, shutting her eyes as she spoke that she might not see the treacherous waves and the swaying boat.  \"Halloo, halloo! What now, deary?\" exclaimed Coomber. And it was wonderful to see the change in his hard face as he lifted the little girl in his arms and kissed her.  \"She says she'll go,\" said Dick, \"but I don't believe she means it.\"  \"Yes I do. You'll take me, daddy, won't yer--'cos I've picked a lot of samphire--all that, and another basketful up there? Go and fetch it, Bob, and daddy can put it in the boat. And I'm going, too.\"  \"So you shall, deary, so you shall,\" said the old fisherman, in a pleased tone, for he had often tried to coax her out with him on the sea; but the memory of that awful night on the bar sands still clung to her, and the sight of the boat, swayed about at the mercy of the waves, filled her with a nameless terror.  \"There won't be a storm, will there?\" asked Tiny, with a shiver of fear, as the fisherman carefully lifted her in and placed her beside the basket of samphire.  \"My deary, if I thought the wind 'ud be even a bit fresh to-night, I wouldn't take yer,\" said the fisherman, in an earnest tone.  He had never been so tender with one of his own children--unless it was to the little girl lying in the churchyard--as he was to this little waif of the sea; and now, as he pushed off from the shore, he was careful to keep the old boat as steady as possible, and sat watching her little frightened face as he plied his oars. He kept as close to the beach, too, as he well could, just skirting the sand-banks, so that she should have the comfort of seeing the land all the way along.  After a few minutes Tiny grew less frightened, and ventured to ask a question about where they were going.  \"Oh, I'll take yer to see Dame Peters while Bob unloads the boat,\" said Coomber, nodding at her in an approving manner.  \"And shall I see the shops?\" asked Tiny; for she did not believe what Dick had told her.  \"Shops, shops!\" repeated the fisherman, resting on his oars for a minute to stare at the little girl. \"Well, there's a shop,\" he said, slowly; \"but I don't see what you can want there.\"  \"Do they sell books?\" asked Tiny, eagerly.  For answer the fisherman burst into a loud laugh. \"What does a little 'un like you know about books?\" he said. \"But I know of something they do sell, as 'll suit you a deal better; they sell sweets, and almond rock, as well as 'bacca and bread, and you shall have some, my deary.\"  The fisherman expected a joyous outburst in anticipation of these unwonted dainties, but the little girl said slowly--  \"Don't they sell books, too, daddy? I'd rather have a book than almond rock,\" she added.  \"Why, what do you want with a book, a little 'un like you?\" said Coomber, impatiently.  \"We both wants it, Dick and me; we wants to find out whether God loves boys as well as gals.\"  The fisherman looked at her serious little face for a minute, and then burst into a laugh again. \"Well, you are a rum 'un as ever I came across. Did you hear that, Bob?\" he asked, appealing to his elder son, who was steering. Bob turned his sulky face round.  \"What's she saying now?\" he asked.  \"What was, it little 'un--whether God loved boys and gals, wasn't it?\" asked the fisherman, who was highly amused at the question.  \"He don't love none of us, I can tell her that,\" said Bob, sharply. \"He forgot us long ago, if ever He knowed anything about us.\"  \"There, what d'ye think o' that, little 'un?\" said the fisherman, pulling away at the oars.  Tiny looked perplexed for a minute or two, but at length she said: \"I think God knows all about the Point, 'cos He loves me, and He listens when I say my prayers. But s'pose I tell him,\" she suddenly added, as though the thought had just occurred to her; \"I can ask Him to bless you and mammy, and Dick and Bob. But I should like to get a book,\" she said, in conclusion.  \"Oh, the sweets 'll do as well,\" said the fisherman, who saw little use in books. He might have humoured Tiny in what he looked upon as a most extraordinary whim, but he never remembered seeing such a thing as a book in Fellness all the years he had known the place. People might have books, some of them, at least, but they were not of much use to fisher-folks, and he rather despised them.  The sun had gone down before they landed; but the moon was rising; and so, between daylight and moonlight, they would be able to get back without any difficulty, when the fish and samphire were disposed of.  \"Now, Bob, get her unloaded, while I take the little 'un up to see Dame Peters,\" said Coomber, as he lifted Tiny out of the boat.  She was looking round eagerly in search of the houses and shops, for in spite of what she had been told, she could not divest herself of the idea that Fellness was a grand, glorious place, where everything could be bought if people only had fish and seaweed enough; and surely two big baskets of samphire were sufficient to buy a book.  But to her disappointment she saw only a few lounging fishermen and children--like herself and Dick--instead of the crowds of people she had expected; and as for shops--well, she could see a row of stone cottages at a distance. There might be a dozen, perhaps, and a few sheds and outbuildings, but the rest of the landscape was flat and unoccupied as their own Point; and at the sight Tiny hid her face in the fisherman's neck and burst into tears.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER IV.  TINY'S TREASURE.   \"Well, now, if you can make her out, it's more than I can,\" said Coomber, pausing in the doorway of Dame Peters' cottage, after he had seated Tiny by the old woman's fire.  \"Oh, leave her here for half an hour; she'll be all right by the time you come back; there's no 'counting for children, and she may feel frightened a bit, for all she ain't cried till she got ashore.\"  \"It's just that that beats me,\" said the fisherman; \"she's as lively as you please in the boat, but as soon as she gets out, down she pops her head, and begins to pipe her eye.\"  \"Well, there, you go and look after Perkins and the fish, and I'll see to her,\" said Dame Peters, a little impatiently; for she had some potatoes cooking for her husband's supper, and she knew they needed attention. After looking to these, she turned to Tiny, who had dried her tears by this time, and sat watching the old woman. \"D'ye like to see pictures, deary?\" she asked; and at the same time she opened the top drawer of an old-fashioned chest of drawers, and brought out a print, which she laid on the table, and lifted Tiny, chair and all, close up to look at it.  Pictures were not to be seen in every cottage a few years ago, as they may be now. The _Band of Hope Review_ and _British Workman_ had not been heard of in Fellness at the time of which we write, and so Dame Peters was very choice of her picture, although she knew nothing about the reading at the back of it.  Tiny brightened up wonderfully when her eyes fell upon this treasure; but after looking at it for some minutes, while Dame Peters turned out the potatoes, she ventured to lift it up and look at the other side, and she exclaimed joyfully: \"Oh, it's a book! There's reading on it!\"  \"What, what!\" exclaimed the old woman, turning from the fireplace to see what had happened. \"What is it, child?\"  \"See, see, there's reading--G O D! What does that spell?\" asked Tiny, looking up in the old woman's face, her finger still resting on the word she had picked out.  \"Bless the child, how should I know? S'pose it is some sort of reading, as you say; but I never learned a letter in my life.\"  \"And I've a'most forgot,\" said Tiny, sadly; and then her finger roved over the printed page, and she found that she could remember most of the letters now she saw them again; but how to put them together was the difficulty. She had forgotten how to do this entirely. G O D spelt a word familiar enough to her at one time, but which of all the words she used now those letters were intended to signify, she could not remember. Again and again her finger returned to the well-remembered letters, but beyond this her memory failed her; and she sat, with puckered brow and steadfast eyes, still looking at the printed page instead of the picture, when Coomber came back.  \"Oh, daddy, daddy, look here!\" exclaimed Tiny; \"here's a book with reading!\"  \"She's just sat and looked at them letters, as she calls 'em, ever since you've been gone,\" said Dame Peters, in a half-offended tone; for her picture was not valued as much as it ought to be, she thought.  \"Oh, she's a rum 'un,\" said Coomber. \"Well, now, are you ready, little 'un?\" he asked.  Tiny looked up wistfully in the old woman's face. \"Couldn't I take this home, and show it to Dick?\" she asked, timidly, laying her hand on the print.  \"Take my picture home!\" exclaimed the old woman.  Coomber turned the paper over, and looked at it contemptuously. \"Peters got this when he went to Grimsby, I s'pose?\" he said.  \"Yes, he did.\"  \"Well now, couldn't you let her have it, and let Peters bring you another?\" said the fisherman, who was anxious that his darling should be gratified if possible.  But the old woman was little more than a child herself over this picture, and was unwilling to part with it at first. At last she agreed to sell it to Tiny for a basket of samphire, for this seaweed made a kind of pickle among the fisher-folk, and was of some marketable value, too, for it did not grow everywhere along the coast, although round Bermuda Point it flourished in great luxuriance.  Tiny was only too glad to obtain such a treasure on such easy terms, although she was paying about five times the value of it; and when it had been folded up and carefully stowed away in Coomber's pocket, she was quite ready to go to the boat, although Dame Peters pressed them to stay and have some of the hot potatoes for supper.  Tiny seemed brimful of joy that night; and when she was seated in the boat, and they were rowing over the placid water, she so far forgot her fears as to begin singing. Something in the surroundings had recalled to her mind the time when she used to sing nearly every night her mother's favourite hymn. It all came back to her as freshly as though she had sung it only last week; and her sweet young voice rang out bold and clear--      \"Star of Peace to wanderers weary,       Bright the beams that smile on me;     Cheer the pilot's vision dreary,       Far, far at sea.\"  She paused there, not feeling quite sure of the next verse; but Coomber said quickly--  \"Go on, deary, go on; don't you know the next bit?\"  \"I'll try,\" said Tiny; and again the voice rang out in its childish treble--      \"Star of Hope, gleam on the billow,       Bless the soul that sighs for Thee;     Bless the sailor's lonely pillow,       Far, far at sea.\"  \"Who told you that, deary?\" asked the fisherman, eagerly, when she paused again.  \"My mother used to sing it every night. She used to say it was meant for daddy. And she told me I must always sing it, too, only somehow I've forgot everything since I came here.\"  \"Never mind the rest, deary; try and think about that. It's just the song for a sailor and a sailor's lass.\"  \"That's just what my mother used to say--that I was a sailor's lass!\" exclaimed Tiny.  \"And she taught you just the right kind of a song. Now try a bit more, deary,\" he added, coaxingly.      \"Star of Faith, when winds are mocking       All his toil, he flies to Thee;     Save him, on the billows rocking,       Far, far at sea.\"  \"I don't think I know any more,\" said the child, as she finished this verse.  \"Well, you've done first-rate, deary; and mind, you must sing that song to me every night,\" he added.  For a little while they went on in silence, and nothing could be heard but the gentle lap, lap of the waves at the side of the boat, until Coomber said: \"Come, sing to us again about that sailor's star. Bob, you try and pick it up as she sings,\" he added.  So the verses were sung through again, and without a break this time; and Tiny was able to recall the last verse, too, and sang--      \"Star Divine, oh! safely guide him,       Bring the wanderer back to Thee;     Sore temptations long have tried him,       Far, far at sea.\"  \"Bravo, little 'un,\" exclaimed Bob, who was completely charmed out of his sulky mood by the singing.  \"I say, Bob,\" suddenly exclaimed Coomber, \"is the bottle up there?\"  \"I ain't seen the bottle,\" sulkily responded the lad, his ill-humour returning at once.  \"I--I took it up, and told 'em to fill it,\" exclaimed Coomber; and as he spoke he drew in his oars, and felt under the seat, and all round the boat. \"I must ha' forgot it, thinking about the little 'un and her picture,\" he said, after searching round the boat in vain.  \"It's too late to go back,\" said Bob; \"it'll be dark soon.\"  \"Ye-es, it's too late to go back with the child,\" said Coomber, slowly and regretfully; though what he should do without his nightly dose of whisky he did not know.  \"Sing again,\" whispered Bob to Tiny; and the next minute the little voice rang out once more its \"Star of Peace.\"  It brought peace to the angry fisherman--the more angry, perhaps, because he had nobody but himself to blame that the bottle had been left behind. Before they landed the singing had worked its mysterious charm, and the fisherman had almost forgotten his anger, and his bottle, too.  \"You tie up the boat, and make haste in, Bob,\" he said, as he took the little girl in his arms, and stepped out upon the shore. A light was shining in the window of the old boat-house, and Tiny was all impatience to get home and show her treasure to Dick.  \"Take it out of your pocket, daddy, and give it to me,\" she said, as they were crossing the sands; and the moment the door was opened she ran in, exclaiming, \"I've got it! I've got it, Dick!\"  \"Hush, hush, deary; Dick and Tom have gone to bed, and both are fast asleep. Come in and get your supper; it's been waiting ever so long for you.\" As she spoke, the poor woman cast several furtive glances at her husband, fearing that he was more than usually morose, as he had not spoken; but, to her surprise, he said, in a merry tone:  \"Bless you, mother, the little 'un has got something better than supper. Dame Peters wanted her to stay and have some hot potatoes; but she was in such a hurry to be off with her prize that she wouldn't look at the potatoes.\"  \"I've got some reading,\" said Tiny, in a delighted whisper, holding up her sheet of paper.  \"Why, what's the good of that?\" exclaimed Mrs. Coomber, in a disappointed tone. \"Nobody at the Point can read, unless it's the Hayes' at the farm.\"  \"And she'd better not let me catch her with any of them,\" put in Coomber, sharply.  \"Dick and me are going to learn to read by ourselves,\" announced Tiny, spreading out her picture on the table. This would enhance its value to everybody, she thought, since Dame Peters set such store by it solely because of the picture. And so she did not venture to turn it over to con the letters on the other side until after Bob had come in, and they had all looked at it.  \"What's it all about?\" asked Bob, turning to the smoking plate of fish which his mother had just placed on the table.  \"Don't you see it's a kind man putting his hand on the boys' heads?\" said Tiny, rather scornfully.  \"Oh, anybody can see that,\" said Bob. \"But what does it mean? That's what I want to know.\"  But Tiny could only shake her head as she gazed earnestly at the print. \"I dunno what it is,\" she said, with a sigh.  \"Come, come, you must put that away for to-night,\" said Mrs. Coomber; \"you ought to have been in bed an hour ago;\" and she would have taken the picture away, but Tiny hastily snatched it up, and, carefully folding it, wrapped it in another piece of paper, and then begged that it might be put away in a drawer for fear it should be lost before the morning.  Mrs. Coomber smiled as she took it from her hand. \"I'll take care of it,\" she said, \"and you go and get your supper.\"  It was not often that the fisherman's family were up so late as this, but no one seemed in a hurry to go to bed. Coomber himself was so good-tempered that his wife and Bob forgot their habitual fear of him in listening to his account of how brave Tiny had been, and how Dame Peters thought she was growing very fast. Then Tiny had to sing one verse of \"Star of Peace,\" after she had finished her supper--Mrs. Coomber would not let her sing more than that, for she was looking very sleepy and tired--and then they all went to bed, with a strange, new feeling of peace and content, Mrs. Coomber vaguely wondering what had become of the whisky bottle, and wishing every night could be like this.  As soon as her eyes were open the next morning Tiny thought of her treasure, and crept into the boys' room to tell Dick the wonderful news. But to her surprise she found the bed was empty; and, peeping into the kitchen, saw Mrs. Coomber washing up the breakfast things.  \"Oh, mammy, what is the time?\" she exclaimed, but yawning as she spoke.  \"Oh, you're awake at last. Make haste and put your clothes on, and come and have your breakfast,\" said Mrs. Coomber.  \"Where's Dick?\" asked Tiny.  \"He's helping daddy and Bob with the net; and you can go, too, when you've had your breakfast. Daddy wouldn't let the boys come and wake you 'cos you was so tired last night.\"  \"What are they doing to the net?\" asked Tiny, as she came to the table.  \"Mending it, of course. Daddy's going shrimping to-day.\"  \"What a bother that net is,\" said Tiny. \"Daddy's always mending it.\"  \"Yes, so he is, deary. It's old, you see, and we can't afford to get a new one.\"  \"I've got to get a lot of samphire to-day, and I promised Dick I'd make some more letters for him in the sand,\" said Tiny, meditatively.  \"But daddy wants you to help him with the net,\" suggested Mrs. Coomber. The little girl had always been so pliant, so amenable to control, that Mrs. Coomber was surprised to hear her say passionately--  \"I won't do that nasty net. I must pick the samphire for Dame Peters, and show Dick my picture, first;\" and then she snatched up a basket, and ran out, not to the sands, where the fisherman and his boys sat mending the torn net, but away to the salt-marsh, where the seaweed grew thickest, and she could fill her basket most quickly. In an hour or two she came home, looking tired and cross.  \"Ain't Dick come home yet?\" she asked, throwing herself on the floor.  \"They ain't done the net yet. Tom came to fetch you a little while ago.\"  \"I don't want Tom, I want Dick. We're going to make some letters, and learn to read,\" said Tiny.  \"You'd better leave the reading alone, if it makes you so cross,\" said Mrs. Coomber.  \"No, it don't make me cross; it's that nasty net.\"  \"But you always liked to help daddy wind the string and mend the net before. Why don't you go to them now?\"  But Tiny would not move. She lay on the floor, kicking and grumbling, because Dick could not leave the net and come and see her picture.  \"You're a very naughty girl, Tiny,\" said Mrs. Coomber at last; \"and I don't see how you can think God will love you if you don't try to be good.\"  The little girl sat up instantly, and looked earnestly into her face. \"My other mammy used to say something like that,\" she said, slowly. And then she burst into tears, and ran and shut herself in the boys' bedroom.  What passed there, Mrs. Coomber did not know; but, half an hour afterwards, as she glanced out of the little kitchen window, she saw her running across the sands to where the group of boys sat mending the old net; and she smiled as she thought of what her words had done. She did not know what a hard fight Tiny had had with herself before she could make up her mind to give up her own way; she only thought how pleased her husband would be when he saw the child come running towards him, and that a fit of ill-humour, from which they would probably all have suffered, had been warded off by the little girl's conquest of herself.  But neither Tiny nor Mrs. Coomber ever forgot that day. A new element was introduced into the lives of the fisherman's family. The little girl learned her first lesson in self-control, and Dick and Tom began to master the difficulties of the alphabet; for, when the net was finished, and Bob and his father waded out into the sea on their shrimping expedition, Tiny ran and fetched her pretty picture to show the boys, and then they all set to work with bits of stick to make the letters in the sand.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER V.  ON THE SANDS.   Tiny was somewhat disappointed as the days went on to find that her pupils, Tom and Dick, took less and less interest in learning the letters she marked in the sand, or pointed out on the paper. They teased her to know how to put the letters together and make them into words which they could understand. But, alas! labour as she would, Tiny could not get over this difficulty even for herself. She had a dim idea that G O D spelt God, but she could not be quite sure--not sure enough to tell Dick that it was so. It was enough, however, to quicken her own interest in what the lines of letters might be able to tell her if only she could solve the mystery of putting them into words, for doubtless they would clear up her anxiety as to whether God loved boys as well as girls.  She did not spend her whole time poring over her picture. She gathered samphire, helped to sort the fish when it was brought in, or mend the much-despised net; but every day she spent some time diligently tracing out the letters she knew and spelling over G O D.  She might have mastered the difficulty with very little trouble if the fisherman had been less obstinate in his quarrel with the farm people, for Harry Hayes and his sisters were often down on the sands, sometimes bringing their books with them, and Dick, who longed to join them in their play, tried to persuade Tiny to go and ask them to help her with the reading difficulty.  \"Dad won't say anything to you, even if he should see you talking; but he won't see, and I won't tell,\" urged Dick, one day, when the children from the farm were at play among the sandhills, and occasionally casting sidelong glances towards Dick and Tiny.  But the little girl only shook her head. \"I can't, Dick,\" she said; \"God wouldn't like it; mother told me that long ago.\"  \"But how is He to know if you don't tell Him?\" said the boy, in an impatient tone.  \"Don't you know that God can see us all the time; that He's taking care of us always?\" said Tiny, slowly.  \"Oh, come! what'll you tell us next?\" said Dick, looking over his shoulder with a gesture of fear. \"He ain't here now, you know,\" he added.  \"Yes he is,\" said the little girl, confidently; \"mother said God was a Spirit. I dunno what that is, but it's just as real as the wind. We can't see that you know, but it's real; and we can't see God, but He's close to us all the time.\"  The boy crept closer to her while she was speaking. \"What makes you talk like that?\" he said, in a half-frightened tone.  \"What's a matter, Dick?\" she asked, not understanding his fear. \"Don't you like to think God is close to you, and all round you,\" she suddenly added, in surprise.  Dick shook his head. \"Nobody never thinks about God at Bermuda Point, so p'r'aps He don't come here,\" he said, at last, in a tone of relief. \"Oh, I say, Tiny, look! Harry Hayes has got a book! Let's go and see what it's about!\"  \"Well, we'll ask dad when he come home to-night, and p'r'aps he'll let us,\" said the little girl, turning resolutely to her own paper again.  \"Oh, then, it's dad you're afraid of, and not God?\" said Dick.  \"Afraid! What do you mean?\" asked Tiny. \"God loves me, and takes care of me, and so does daddy; and if I was to talk to Harry Hayes, it would make him cross, and God doesn't like us to make people cross; and little gals has to do as they are told, you know.\"  \"Oh yes; I know all about that,\" said Dick; \"but what do you suppose God thinks of dad when he makes himself cross with the whisky?\"  \"Oh! He's dreadfully sorry, Dick, I know He is, for He makes me afraid of him sometimes, when he's had a big lot; and he's just the dearest daddy when he forgets to bring the bottle home from Fellness.\"  \"Ah, but that ain't often,\" grunted Dick; \"and if God wouldn't like you to talk to Harry Hayes, 'cos dad says you musn't, I'd like to know what He thinks of dad sometimes, that's all.\" And then Dick ran away, for if he could not speak to the farm children, he liked to be near them when they came to play on the sands.  A minute or two after Dick had left her, Tiny was startled by a sound close at hand, and, looking round, she saw Coomber coming from the other side of the sandhill.  \"Oh, dad, I thought you was out in the boat,\" she said.  [Illustration: \"'I WANT YOU TO SING A BIT, WHILE I RUB AWAY AT THIS OLD GUN.'\" (_See page 81._)]  \"Bob and Tom have gone by themselves to-day, for I wanted to clean the gun ready for winter,\" said the fisherman, still rubbing at the lock with a piece of oiled rag.  Tiny looked up at him half shyly, half curiously, for if he had only been on the other side of the sand-ridge, he must have heard all she and Dick had been talking about.  But if he had heard the fisherman took no notice of what had passed.  \"Come, I want you to sing a bit, while I rub away at this old gun,\" he said. \"Sing 'Star of Peace'; it'll sound first-rate out here;\" as though he had never heard it out there before, when, as a matter of fact, scarcely a day passed but she sang it to please him.  When she had finished, he said, quickly: \"What do you think about that 'Star of Peace' deary? It's the sailor's star, you know, so I've got a sort of share in it like.\"  \"I think it means God. I'm a'most sure mother said it meant God,\" added the little girl.  \"Ah, then, I don't think there's much share of it for me,\" said Coomber, somewhat sadly; and he turned to rubbing his gun again, and began talking about it--how rusty he had found it, and how he would have to use it more than ever when winter came, for the boat was growing old, and would not stand much more knocking about by the rough wintry sea; so he and Bob must shoot more wild birds, and only go out in calm weather when winter came. Then half shyly, and with apparent effort, he brought the conversation round so as to include Farmer Hayes.  \"He ain't a bad sort, you know, Tiny, if he could just remember that a fisherman is a bit proud and independent, though he may be poor; and if you could do one of them young 'uns a good turn any time, why, you're a sailor's lass, yer know, and a sailor is always ready to do a good turn to anybody.\"  \"Yes, daddy,\" said Tiny, slowly and thoughtfully; and then, after a minute's pause, she said: \"Daddy, I think Harry or Polly would just like to help me a bit with this reading.\"  For answer the fisherman burst into a loud laugh. \"That's what you'd like, I s'pose?\" he said, as he looked at her.  \"Yes; I want to find out about this picture, and these letters tell all about it, I know--if I only could find out what they mean,\" said Tiny, eagerly.  \"Oh, well, when I'm gone indoors you can go and ask 'em if they'd like to help you,\" he said, with another short laugh. \"Maybe you'll be able to tell us all about it when winter comes, and it'll soon be here now,\" added the fisherman, with a sigh.  Never before had Coomber looked forward with such dread to the winter. Until lately he had always thought the fishing-boat would \"last his time,\" as he used to say; but he had patched and repaired it so often lately, until at last the conviction had been forced upon him that it was worn out; and to be caught in a sudden squall on the open sea, would inevitably break her up, and all who were in her would meet with a watery grave. He was as brave as a lion; but to know that his boat was gradually going to pieces, and that its timbers might part company at almost any moment, made even his courage quail; especially when he thought of his wife, and the boys, and this little helpless girl. Some hard things had been said at Fellness about his folly in taking her upon his hands when she could without difficulty have been sent to the poorhouse. A girl was such a useless burden, never likely to be helpful in managing a boat, as a boy might be; and it was clear that no reward would ever be obtained from her friends, even if they were found, for her clothing made it evident that she was only the child of poor parents.  This had been the reasoning among the Fellness busybodies ever since Coomber had announced his intention of taking the little girl home; but he was as obstinate in this as in most other things. He had followed his own will, or rather the God-like compassion of his own heart, in spite of the poverty that surrounded him, and the hard struggle he often had to get bread enough for his own children.  \"I'll just have to stay out a bit longer, or go out in the boat a bit oftener,\" he said, with a light laugh, when they attempted to reason him out of his project. He did not know then that the days of his boat were numbered; but he knew it now--knew that starvation stared them in the face, and at no distant date either. He could never hope to buy a new boat. It would cost over twenty pounds, and he seldom owned twenty pence over the day's stock of bread and other household necessaries. Among these he counted his whisky; for that a fisherman could do his work without a daily supply of ardent spirits never entered his head. Blue ribbon armies and temperance crusades had never been heard of, and it was a fixed belief among the fisher folk that a man could not work without drinking as well as eating, and drinking deeply, too.  So Coomber never thought of curtailing his daily allowance of grog to meet the additional expense of his household: he rather increased the allowance, that he might be able to work the boat better, as he fancied, and so catch more fish. When he forgot his bottle and left it at Fellness, it struck him as something all but marvellous that he should be able to work the next day without his usual drams, but it had not convinced him that he could do without it all together. Of its effect upon himself, in making him sullen, morose, and disagreeable, he was in absolute ignorance, and so the children's talk about it came upon him as a revelation. He knew that Tiny sometimes shrank from and avoided him; but he had considered it a mere childish whim, not to be accounted for by anything in himself; and so to hear that she was absolutely afraid of him sometimes was something to make him think more deeply than he had ever done in his life before.  But he did not say a word to Tiny about this. When he had done rubbing his gun he carried it home, and Tiny was left free to make acquaintance with the farm children.  She walked shyly up to where they were sitting--Polly reading, and Harry throwing sand at Dick, who had seated himself at a short distance, and was returning the salute.  \"Would--wouldn't you like to tell me about these letters, please?\" said Tiny, holding out her paper to Polly.  \"Well, that's a rum way of asking,\" said Harry, with a laugh. \"Suppose she wouldn't now, little 'un,\" he added.  \"Then she mustn't,\" said Tiny, stoutly; though the tears welled up to her eyes at the thought of all her hopes being overthrown just when they seemed about to be realised.  \"Don't, Harry; what a tease you are!\" said his sister. \"I should like to tell you, dear,\" she added, in a patronising tone. \"Come and sit down here, and tell me what you want.\"  \"It's what you want; don't forget that, Polly, else she'll get her back up, and go off again,\" laughed her brother; but he was not sorry the embargo had been taken off their intercourse with the fisherman's family; for although he had had surreptitious dealings with boys sometimes, they had to be so watchful lest they should be discovered that the play was considerably hindered. Now he understood that this advance on Tiny's part was a direct concession from Coomber himself, for he and the boys had long ago agreed to try and draw the little girl into some intimacy as the only way of breaking down the restrictions laid upon them. But Tiny had proved obstinate. She had been asked again and again, but she had always returned the same answer: \"Daddy would let her some day, and then she would play with them.\" So Harry Hayes was perfectly aware that she had won the fisherman's consent at last, although no word had been said about it.  When the girls were left to themselves, Polly took up the picture and looked at it, then turned it over and read, \"God is good to all: He loves both boys and girls.\" At this point Tiny interrupted her by laying her hand on her arm, and saying eagerly: \"Are you quite sure that is what it says?\"  \"Why, don't you think I can read?\" said Polly, in a half-offended tone. But the subject was new to her, and so she was anxious to read further, and turned to the page again and read on. At the bottom was a line or two in smaller print, and Polly read these longer words with a touch of pride: \"Jesus said, Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.\"  \"Then this must be Jesus, and these are the little children,\" concluded Polly, as she turned over the paper to look at the picture again.  The two girls sat and looked at it and talked about it for a few minutes, and then Tiny said wistfully: \"Will you show me now how you make up them nice words?\"  \"Oh, it's easy enough if you know the letters; but you must learn the letters first,\" said Polly; and she proceeded to tell Tiny the name of each; and the little girl had the satisfaction of knowing now that she had remembered them quite correctly, and that G O D did spell God, as she had surmised.  She was not long now in putting other words together; and before she went home she was able to spell out the first two lines of the printed page, for they were all easy words, and intended for beginners.  What a triumph it was to Tiny to be able to read out to the fisherman's family what she had learned on the sands that day. She was allowed to have the candle all to herself after supper, and they sat round the table looking at each other in wondering amazement as her little finger travelled along the page, and she spelt out the wonderful news, \"'God is good to all: He loves both boys and girls.' It's true, Dick, what I told you, ain't it?\" she said, in a tone of delighted satisfaction.  Dick scratched his head, and looked round at his father, wondering what he would think or say. For a minute or two the fisherman smoked his pipe in silence. At length, taking it from his mouth, he said, in a slow, meditative fashion: \"Well, little 'un, I s'pose if it's printed that way it's true; and if it is, why I s'pose we've all got a share in that 'Star of Peace' we was talking about to-day.\"  Tiny did not quite follow his train of thought; but she nodded her head, and then proceeded to tell them what she had heard about the picture, and the conclusion she and Polly had arrived at upon the subject--that Jesus, the kind, loving man of the picture, had come to show them how kind God was to them.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER VI.  BAD TIMES.   Winter around Bermuda Point was at all times a dreary season, and the only thing its few inhabitants could hope for was that its reign might be as short as possible. A fine, calm autumn was hailed as a special boon from heaven by the fisher-folk all round the coast, and more especially by the lonely dwellers at the Point.  A fine autumn enabled Coomber to go out in his boat until the time for shooting wild fowl began, and the children could play on the sands, or gather samphire, instead of being penned up in the house half the time. But when the weather was wild and wet, and the salt marshes lay under water, that meant little food and much discomfort, frequent quarrels, and much bitterness to the fisherman's family.  This autumn the weather was more than usually boisterous; and long before the usual time the old boat had to be drawn up on to the bank, for fear the waves should dash it to pieces. The fisherman sometimes went to Fellness, on the chance of picking up a stray job, for it was only the state of his boat, and his anxiety to keep it together as long as possible, that prevented him braving the perils of the sea; and so he sometimes got the loan of another boat, or helped another fisherman with his; and then, rough though they might be, these fisher-folk were kind and helpful to each other, and if they could not afford to pay money for a job, they could pay for it in bread or flour, or potatoes, perhaps, and so they would generally find Coomber something to do, that they might help him, without hurting him.  But there was little work that could be done in such bad weather as this, and he knew it, and his proud, independent spirit could not brook to accept even a mouthful of bread that he had not earned; and so there were many weary days spent at home, or sauntering round the coast with his gun, on the look-out for a stray wild fowl. Tiny often went to bed hungry, and woke up feeling faint and sick; and although she never forgot to say her prayers, she could not help thinking sometimes that God must have forgotten her. She read her paper to Dick, and he and Tom had both learned to spell out some of the words, and she read to herself again and again the Divine assurance, \"God is good to all: He loves both boys and girls;\" but then, as Dick said sometimes, Bermuda Point was such a long way from anywhere, and He might forget there were any boys and girls living there.  When she was very hungry, and more than usually depressed, Tiny thought Dick must be right, but even then she would not admit such a thought to others. When she saw Mrs. Coomber in tears, because she had no food to prepare for her hungry children, she would steal up to her, pass her little arm round the poor woman's neck, and whisper, \"God is good; He'll take care of us, mammy; He'll send us some supper, if He can't send us any dinner;\" and the child's hopeful words often proved a true prophecy, for sometimes when Coomber had been out all day without finding anything that could be called food, he would, when returning, manage to secure a wild duck, perhaps, or a couple of sea magpies, or a few young gulls. Nothing came amiss to the young Coombers at any time, and just now a tough stringy gull was a dainty morsel.  It threatened to be an unusually hard and long winter, and at last Mrs. Coomber ventured to suggest that Tiny should be taken to the poorhouse, at least until the spring, when she could come back again.  \"Look at her poor little white face,\" said the woman, with her apron to her eyes; \"I'm afraid she'll be ill soon, and then what can we do?\"  \"Time enough to talk about that when she is ill,\" said Coomber, gruffly, as he took up his gun and went out. They were generally able to keep a good fire of the drift-wood and wreckage that was washed ashore, for unfortunately there was scarcely a week passed but some noble vessel came to grief on the perilous bar sands during the more boisterous weather. Once, when they were at their wits' end for food, and Bob had begged his mother to boil some samphire for supper, Tiny was fortunate enough to discover an unopened cask which the sea had cast up the night before, and left high and dry behind the ridge of sandhills. She was not long fetching Bob and the boys to see her treasure trove; all sorts of wild speculations passing through her mind as to what it could contain as she ran shouting--  \"Bob! Bob! Dick! Dick! Come and see what I've found.\"  [Illustration: \"'DICK, DICK, COME AND SEE WHAT I'VE FOUND.'\" (_See page 96._)]  The boys were not long in making their appearance, and Bob fetched a hatchet, and soon broke open the cask; and oh! what joy for the starving children--it was full of ship biscuits!  \"Oh, Dick, didn't I tell you this morning God hadn't forgotten us?\" said Tiny, in a quavering voice, when Bob announced what the cask contained.  \"Oh, yes,\" said Dick, \"so you did;\" but he was too hungry to think of anything but the biscuits now--too hungry even to shout his joy, as he would have done at another time. As soon as they could be got at, he handed one to Tiny, and then Tom and Dick helped themselves, filling their pockets and munching them at the same time; but Tiny, though she nibbled her biscuit as she went, ran at once to tell Mrs. Coomber of her wonderful discovery; and she, scarcely daring to believe that such good news could be true, ran out at once to see for herself, and met the boys, who confirmed Tiny's tale. But she must see the cask for herself, and then she ate and filled her apron, and shed tears, and thanked God for this wonderful gift all at the same time. Then she told the boys to come and fetch some baskets at once, to carry them home in, and she would sort them over, for some were soaked with sea-water, but others near the middle were quite dry. Bob took a bagful and went in search of his father along the coast, and everybody was busy carrying or sorting or drying the biscuits, for they had to be secured before the next tide came in, or they might be washed away again.  When Coomber came home, bringing a couple of sea-gulls he had shot, he was fairly overcome at the sight of the biscuits.  \"Daddy, it was God that sent 'em,\" said Tiny, in an earnest, joyful whisper.  The fisherman drew his sleeve across his eyes. \"Seems as though it must ha' been, deary,\" he said; \"for how that cask ever came ashore without being broken up well-nigh beats me.\"  \"God didn't let it break, 'cos we wanted the biscuits,\" said Tiny confidently; \"yer see, daddy, He ain't forgot us, though Bermuda Point is a long way from anywhere.\"  The biscuits lasted them for some time, for as the season advanced Coomber was able to sell some of the wild ducks he shot, and so potatoes, and flour, and bread could be brought at Fellness again. If the fisherman could only have believed that whisky was not as necessary as bread, they might have suffered less privation; but every time he got a little money for his wild fowl, the bottle had to be replenished, even though he took home but half the quantity of bread that was needed; and so Tiny sometimes was heard to wish that God would always send them biscuits in a tub, and then daddy couldn't drink the stuff that made him so cross.  Mrs. Coomber smiled and sighed as she heard Tiny whisper this to Dick. She, too, had often wished something similar--or, at least, that her husband could do without whisky. Now, as the supply of wild fowl steadily increased, he came home more sullen than ever. His return from Fellness grew to be a dread even to Tiny at last; and she and Dick used to creep off to bed just before the time he was expected to return, leaving Bob and Tom to bear the brunt of whatever storm might follow.  He seldom noticed their absence, until one night, when, having drunk rather more than usual, he was very cross on coming in, and evidently on the look-out for something to make a quarrel over.  \"Where's Dick and the gal?\" he said, as he looked round the little kitchen, after flinging himself into a chair.  \"They're gone to bed,\" said his wife, timidly, not venturing to look up from her work.  \"Then tell 'em to get up.\"  \"I--I dunno whether it 'ud be good for Tiny,\" faltered the poor woman; \"she's got a cold now, and--and----\"  \"Are you going to call 'em up, or shall I go and lug 'em out of bed?\" demanded the angry, tipsy man.  \"But, Coomber,\" began his wife.  \"There, don't stand staring like that, but do as I tell you,\" interrupted the fisherman; \"I won't have 'em go sneaking off to bed just as I come home. I heard that little 'un say one day she was afraid of me sometimes. Afraid, indeed; I'll teach her to be afraid,\" he repeated, working himself into a passion over some maudlin recollection of the children's talk in the summer-time.  His wife saw it would be of no use reasoning with him in his present mood, and so went to rouse the children without further parley. They were not asleep, and so were prepared for the summons, as they had overheard what had been said.  \"Oh mammy, must I come?\" said Tiny, her teeth chattering with fear, as she slipped out of bed.  \"Don't be afraid, deary--don't let him see you're frightened,\" whispered Mrs. Coomber; \"slip your clothes on as quick as you can, and come and sing 'Star of Peace' to him; then he'll drop off to sleep, and you can come to bed again.\"  \"I will--I will try,\" said the child, trying to force back her tears and speak bravely. But in spite of all her efforts to be brave, and not look as though she was frightened, she crept into the kitchen looking cowed and half-bewildered with terror, and before she could utter a word of her song, Coomber pounced upon her.  \"What do yer look like that for?\" he demanded; \"what business have you to be frightened of me?\"  Tiny turned her white face towards him, and ventured to look up. \"I--I----\"  \"She's going to sing 'Star of Peace,'\" interposed Mrs. Coomber; \"let her come and sit over here by the fire.\"  \"You let her alone,\" roared her husband; \"she's a-going to do what I tell her. Come here,\" he called, in a still louder tone. Tiny ventured a step nearer, but did not go close to him.  \"Are you coming?\" he roared again; then, stretching out his hand, he seized her by the arm, and dragged her towards him, giving her a violent shake as he did so. \"There--now sing!\" he commanded, placing her against his knee.  The child stared at him with a blank, fascinated gaze. Once he saw her lips move, but no sound came from them; and after waiting a minute he dashed her from him with all the strength of his mad fury.  There was a shriek from Mrs. Coomber, and screams from the boys, but poor little Tiny uttered no sound. They picked her up from where she had fallen, or rather had been thrown, and her face was covered with blood; but she uttered no groan--gave no sign of life.  \"Oh, she's dead! she's dead!\" wailed Dick, bending over her as she lay in his mother's arms.  The terrible sight had completely sobered Coomber. \"Did I do it? Did I do that?\" he asked, in a changed voice.  \"Why, yer know yer did,\" growled Bob; \"or leastways the whisky in yer did it. I've often thought you'd do for mother, or one of us; but I never thought yer'd lift yer hand agin a poor little 'un like that.\"  Coomber groaned, but made no reply. \"Hold your tongue, Bob,\" commanded his mother; for she could see that her husband was sorry enough now for what he had done.  \"What's to be done, mother?\" he asked, in a subdued voice; \"surely, surely I haven't killed the child!\"  But Mrs. Coomber feared that he had, and it was this that paralysed all her faculties. \"I don't know what to do,\" she said, helplessly, wiping away the blood that kept flowing from a deep gash on Tiny's forehead.  \"Couldn't you give her some water?\" said Dick, who did not know what else to suggest. Coomber meekly fetched a cupful from the pan outside, and Mrs. Coomber dipped her apron in it, and bathed Tiny's face; and in a minute or two Dick saw, to his great delight, that she drew a faint, fluttering breath. Coomber saw it too, and the relief was so great that he could not keep back his tears. \"Please God He'll spare us His little 'un, I'll never touch another drop of whisky,\" he sobbed, as he leaned over his wife's chair, and watched her bathe the still pallid face.  \"Open the door, Dick, and let her have a breath of fresh air; and don't stand too close,\" said his mother, as Tiny drew another faint breath.  The door was opened, and the boys stood anxiously aside, watching the faint, gasping breath, until at last Tiny was able to swallow a little of the water; and then they would have closed round her again, but their mother kept them off.  \"Would a drop o' milk do her good?\" whispered Coomber after a time; but she was sensible enough to recognise his voice, and shuddered visibly. He groaned as he saw it; but drew further back, so that she should not see him when she opened her eyes.  \"Give me the sticking-plaster, Dick,\" said his mother, when Tiny had somewhat revived. Mrs. Coomber was used to cuts and wounds, and could strap them up as cleverly as a surgeon. It was not the sight of the ugly cut that had frightened her, but the death-like swoon, which she did not understand.  \"How about the milk, mother?\" Coomber ventured to ask, after Tiny's forehead was strapped up and bandaged.  Again came that shudder of fear, and the little girl crept closer to the sheltering arms. \"Don't be frightened, deary; daddy won't hurt you now.\"  \"Don't let him come,\" whispered Tiny; but Coomber heard the whisper, and it cut him to the heart, although he kept carefully in the background as he repeated his question.  \"Would yer like a little milk, deary?\" asked Mrs. Coomber.  \"There ain't no money to buy milk,\" said Tiny, in a feeble, weary tone.  But Coomber crept round the back of the kitchen, so as to keep out of sight, took up the bottle of whisky he had brought home, and went out. He brought a jug of milk when he came back. \"You can send for some more to-morrow, and as long as she wants it,\" he said, as he stood the jug on the table.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER VII.  A TEA MEETING.   Tiny was very ill the next day--too ill to get up, or to notice what was passing around her. Mrs. Coomber, who had had very little experience of sickness, was very anxious when she saw Tiny lying so quiet and lifeless-looking, the white bandage on her forehead making her poor little face look quite ghastly in its paleness. The fisherman had crept into the room before he went out, to look at her while she was asleep, and the sight had made his heart ache.  \"I never thought I could ha' been such a brute as to hurt a little 'un like that,\" he said, drawing his sleeve across his eyes, and speaking in a whisper to his wife.  \"It was the whisky,\" said his wife, by way of comforting him.  But Coomber would not accept even this poor comfort. \"I was a fool to take so much,\" he said. \"Wus than a fool, for I knowed it made me savage as a bear; and yet I let it get the mastery of me. But it's the last, mother; I took the bottle to the farm last night, and they're going to let me have the value of it in milk for the little 'un, and please God she gets well again, it's no more whisky I'll touch.\"  It was not easy for a man like Coomber to make such a promise, and still more difficult to keep it. For the first few days, while Tiny was very ill, it was not so hard to send Bob and Tom to Fellness, with the teal and widgeon he had shot; but when she began to get better, and the craving for the drink made itself felt, then began the tug of war. During the first few days of the little girl's illness, the fisherman kept carefully out of her sight, though he longed to see her once more, and hear her say she had forgiven him the cruel blow he had dealt to her.  Tiny, too, longed for him to come and see her in the daytime; but as it grew dusk the longing passed away, and every night, as the hour drew near when he usually came back from Fellness, a positive dread and terror of him seized her, and she would lie shivering and holding Mrs. Coomber's hand whenever she heard his voice in the kitchen.  Mrs. Coomber tried to persuade her husband to go and see the child in the daytime; but he only shook his head. \"She hates me, and I don't deserve to see her agin,\" he said, gloomily.  He returned the same answer again and again, when pressed to go in and see her before he went out with his gun in the morning. At length, as he sat at breakfast one day, he was startled by Tiny creeping up to him, just as she had slipped out of bed.  \"Oh, daddy, why didn't you come to me?\" she said, with a little gasping sob, throwing her arms round his neck.  \"My deary, my deary,\" he said, in a choking voice, gathering her in his arms, and kissing her, while the tears rolled down his weather-beaten face.  \"Oh, daddy, don't you love me,\" said Tiny; \"that you didn't come to see me all these days?\"  \"Love you, my deary? Ah, you may well ask that, after what I've done to yer; but it was just because I did love yer that I kept away from yer,\" he went on; \"I thought you'd never want to see yer cruel old daddy any more; and as for me, why I'd punish myself by not trying to see yer, or get back your love. That's just how it was, deary,\" said the fisherman, as he looked tenderly at the little pallid face.  \"But, daddy, I love you, and I wanted you all the days,\" said Tiny, nestling closer to him as she spoke.  \"Bless you, deary, I believe you're one of God's own bairns, as well as a sailor's lass,\" said Coomber.  \"I wanted you all the days, daddy; but--but--don't--come--at--night,\" she added, in a hesitating tone.  \"I know what you mean; mother's told me, little 'un,\" he said, drawing his sleeve across his eyes, and sighing.  \"I can't help it, daddy, I can't help it,\" said the little girl, with a sob.  \"Well, I s'pose not; but you needn't be afraid now, you know. I've done with the bottle now; and it wasn't me you was afraid of, mother said, but the whisky.\"  Tiny nodded. \"Yes, that's it,\" she said; \"and I shan't be afraid long if I know you don't have it now;\" and from that time the little girl set herself strenuously to overcome the terror and dread that nightly crept over her; but still it was some time before she could endure Coomber's presence after dusk.  Meanwhile pinching want was again making itself felt in the household. For some reason known only to themselves, the teal and widgeon did not come within range of the fisherman's gun just now; and sometimes, after a whole day spent in the punt, or among the salt marshes along the coast, only a few unsaleable old gulls would reward Coomber's toil. They were not actually uneatable by those who were on the verge of starvation; but they were utterly unfit for a child like Tiny, in her present weak, delicate condition; and again the question of sending her to the poorhouse until the spring was mooted by Mrs. Coomber. Her husband did not refuse to discuss it this time when it was mentioned, and it was evident that he himself had thought of it already, for he said, with a groan--  \"It seems as though God wasn't going to let me keep the little 'un, though she's getting on a bit, for never have I had such a bad shooting season as this since I knocked the little 'un down. It seems hard, mother; what do you think?\"  But Mrs. Coomber did not know what to think; she only knew that poor little Tiny was often hungry, although she never complained. They had eaten up all the store of biscuits by this time; and although Dick and Tom often spent hours wandering along the shore, in the hope of finding another wonderful treasure-trove, nothing had come of their wanderings beyond the usual harvest of drift wood that enabled them to keep a good fire in the kitchen all day.  At length it was decided that Coomber should take Tiny to the poorhouse, and ask the authorities to keep her until this bitter winter was over; and then, when the spring came, and the boat could go out once more, he would fetch her home again.  But it was not without many tears that this proposal was confided to Tiny, the fisherman insisting--though he shrank from the task himself--that she should be told what they thought of doing. \"She is a sailor's lass, and it's only fair to her,\" he said, as he left his wife to break the news to Tiny.  She was overwhelmed at the thought of being separated from those who had been so kind to her, and whom she had learned to love so tenderly, but with a mighty effort she choked back her tears, for she saw how grieved Mrs. Coomber was; though she could not help exclaiming: \"Oh! if God would only let me stay with you, and daddy, and Dick!\"  Her last words to Dick before she started were in a whispered conference, in which she told him to pray to God every day to let her come back soon. \"I will, I will!\" said Dick through his tears; \"I'll say what you told me last night--I'll say it every day.\" And then Coomber and Tiny set out on their dreary walk to Fellness, reaching it about the middle of the afternoon.  Bob and Tom had let their old friends know that their father had given up the whisky, and now he, foolish man, felt half afraid and half ashamed to meet them; but he was obliged to go, for he wanted Peters to go with him, and tell the workhouse people about the rescue of the little girl, for fear they should refuse to take her in unless his story was confirmed.  Coomber explained this to his friend in a rather roundabout fashion, for he had not found Peters on the shore, as he had expected, and where he could have stated his errand in a few words. He had found instead that all the village was astir with the news of a tea-meeting, that was to take place that afternoon in the chapel, and that Peters, who was \"something of a Methody,\" as Coomber expressed it, had gone to help in the preparations.  He was astonished to see Coomber when he presented himself, and still more to hear the errand he had come upon. He scratched his head, and looked pityingly at the little girl, who held fast to Coomber's hand. \"Well now, mate, I'm in a fix,\" he said, slowly, and pointing round the room; \"I've got all these forms to move, and to fix up the tables for 'em by four o'clock; but if you'll stay and lend a hand, why, you and the little 'un 'll be welcome to stay to tea, I know; it's free to all the village to-day,\" he added, \"and the more that come, the better we shall like it.\"  Coomber looked at Tiny, and saw how wistfully her eyes rested on a pile of cakes that stood near; and that look decided him. \"Would you like to have some of it?\" he said, with a faint smile. The little girl's face flushed with joy at the prospect of such a treat. \"Oh, daddy! if I could only take Dick some, too,\" she said.  Both the men laughed, but Peters said, \"Well, well, we'll see what we can do; come in here while daddy helps me with the forms;\" and he led the way into a small room, where several of the fishermen's wives were cutting bread and butter. Peters whispered a word to one of them, and she seated Tiny by the fire, and gave her some bread and butter at once. When the tea was all ready, and the company began to arrive, Coomber fetched Tiny to sit with him, and the two had a bountiful tea, and such cake as the little girl had not tasted for a long time. But she would not eat much. She took what was given to her, but slipped most of it into Coomber's pocket, that he might take it home to Dick, for the little girl thought they would go on to the poorhouse as soon as tea was over.  But while the tea-things were being cleared away, and they were preparing for the meeting that was to follow, the fisherman drew her aside, and whispered: \"I do believe God has heard what you've been a-praying for, deary, for Peters has heard of a job of work for me since I've been here.\"  \"Oh, daddy! and we shall go home together again,\" exclaimed Tiny, looking round for her bonnet at once.  \"Yes, but not jest yet. There's to be some preaching or somethin', and--and--little 'un, I've been a bad man, and I dunno as God'll have anything to do wi' helping such a tough customer to be any better; but if He would--\"  And here Coomber drew his sleeve across his eyes, and turned his head aside to hide his emotion.  The little girl threw her arms round his neck, and drew his face close to hers. \"Oh, daddy, He will! He will!\" she whispered, earnestly; \"He loves you, and He's been waiting all this long time for you to love Him; and you will, won't you, now, you know?\"  But there was no time for Coomber to reply, for the people were taking their seats again, and Peters touched him on the shoulder, motioning him to do the same. The two sat down, feeling too eager for shyness, or to notice that others were looking at them. A hymn was sung, and a prayer followed, and then Coomber began to feel disappointed, for he was hungering to hear something that might set his doubts at rest. At length he heard the words that have brought help and gladness to so many souls: \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" Then followed a simple address, enlarging upon the text, and an exhortation to accept God's offer of salvation. \"The Lord Jesus Christ Himself said: 'Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest,'\" continued the speaker, \"and in His name I beg each one of you to become reconciled to God. He is waiting: He is willing to receive each one of you.\"  These were his closing words, and Coomber, who had listened with eager, rapt attention, stayed only for the people to move towards the door, and then followed the speaker into the little vestry. \"Beg pardon, sir,\" he said, pausing at the door, \"but 'tain't often as I gets the chance of hearing such words as I've heard from you to-night, and so I hopes you'll forgive me if I asks for a bit more. I'm a bad man. I begins to see it all now; but--but----\"  \"My friend, if you feel that you are a sinner, then you are just one of those whom the Lord Jesus died to redeem. He came to seek and to save those who are lost--to redeem them from sin. He gave His life--dying upon the cross, a shameful, painful death--not, mark me, that they may continue in sin. To say we believe in God, and to live in sin, makes our belief of no effect. We must learn of Christ, or He will have died in vain for us. We must learn of Him, and He will help us to overcome our love of drink, our selfishness, and sullenness, and ill-temper;\" for the gentleman knew something of Coomber, and so particularised the sins he knew to be his easily besetting ones.  \"And you think He'd help me? You see, sir, He's done a deal for me lately, bad as I am,\" said Coomber, twisting his hat in his hand.  \"Help you! ah, that He will. If He gave His only Son, what do you think He will withhold? 'What man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him.'\"  \"And what are the good things that I'm to ask for,\" said Coomber. \"I know what the asking means; this little 'un here has taught me that praying is asking God; and though I ain't never done it afore, I'll begin now.\"  \"Do, my man. Ask that the Holy Spirit may be given you, to lead you, and teach you, and guide you into all truth. Without His help you can do nothing; but, seeking His help, trusting in his guidance, you will be enabled to overcome every difficulty and obstacle, however hard it may be.\"  \"And you think God will forgive me all the past?\"  \"My brother, Christ died--He shed His precious blood, to wash away our sin, to set our conscience free from guilt, and to assure us beyond a doubt of the perfect love of God towards us.\"  The words spoken fell into prepared soil, for Coomber had been hungering and thirsting after righteousness, and he went home that night feeling that he had been fed.  What a happy walk home that was for Tiny and the fisherman! As he left the little chapel at Fellness, a basket, well filled with the odds and ends left from the tea-meeting, had been handed to Coomber to take home, and Peters whispered, as he went out: \"I've heard of another job for yer, so be along in good time in the morning, mate.\" To describe Mrs. Coomber's joy, when her husband walked in with Tiny asleep in his arms, and also with the basket of bread and butter, would be impossible.  \"God has given us the little 'un back, mother,\" he said, placing the child in his wife's arms. \"He's been good to me, better than I deserved, only the Lord Jesus Christ has died for me, and that explains it all.\"  His heart was full of joy and gratitude to-night, and he forgot his usual shyness, and told his wife of the good news he had heard at Fellness, both for body and soul. \"Now, mother,\" he said, as he concluded, \"you and I must both begin a new life. We must ask God to help us like this little 'un, and we must teach our boys to do the same. We owe it all to her,\" he added, as he kissed Tiny, \"for if she hadn't come among us, we might never have heard about God down here at Bermuda Point.\"  [Illustration]     CHAPTER VIII.  BRIGHTER DAYS.   The dreary winter came to an end at last, and with the first spring days there was a general bustle of preparation in the fisherman's family, for boat and nets alike required overhauling, and there would be a good deal of repairing to do before the old boat would be fit for further use.  Bob's face was fast losing its sullen, defiant, angry look, and he was whistling as merrily as a lark one morning, when he and Coomber went to remove the tarpaulin that had been covered over the boat during the winter; but the whistling suddenly ceased when the boat was uncovered, for, with all their care, the winter's storms had worked sad havoc with the little craft. Seams were starting, ribs were bulging, and there were gaping holes, that made Coomber lift his hat and scratch his head in consternation.  \"This'll be a tough job, Bob,\" he said.  \"Aye, aye, dad, it will that,\" said the lad, carefully passing his finger down where one rib seemed to be almost rotten.  A few months before Coomber would have raved and blustered, and sworn it was all Bob's fault, but since that tea-meeting at Fellness he had been a changed man--old things had passed away, and all things had become new; and none felt this more than Bob. It was a blessed change for him, and he had given up all thoughts of running away now, if the old boat could only be patched up and made serviceable. But it was a problem whether this could ever be done effectually enough to make it seaworthy.  \"If I'd only found out ten years ago that I could do better without the whisky than with it, we might ha' got a new boat afore this, Bob,\" said the fisherman, with a sigh.  \"Aye, aye, and had Jack with us, too, dad,\" Bob ventured to remark. He had not dared to mention his brother's name for years, but he had thought a good deal of him lately, wishing he could come home, and see the blessed change that had been wrought in his father.  The old fisherman lifted his head, and there was a look of bitter anguish in his face, as he said: \"Hark ye, lad, I'd give all the days of my life to bring Jack back. The thought of him is making yer mother an old woman afore her time, and I can't help it now; it's too late, too late;\" and the old fisherman covered his face and groaned.  \"There now, father, ain't I heard you say it was never too late to repent?\"  \"Aye, lad, that you have, and the precious blood of Christ can take away the guilt of our sin; but, mark me, not even God Himself can do away with the consequences of sin. Hard as they may be, and truly and bitterly as we may repent, the past can't be undone; and as we sow we must reap. Poor Jack! Poor Jack! If I could only know where he was. Why, it's nigh on ten years since he went away, and never a storm comes but I'm thinking my boy may be in it, and wanting help.\"  Bob recalled what had passed on Fellness Sands the night they rescued Tiny, and which had helped him often since to bear with his father's gruff, sullen ways and fierce outbursts of temper; but he would not say any more just now, only he thought that but for that tea-meeting his father would now be mourning the loss of two sons; for he had made up his mind to leave home when it was decided to take Tiny to the poorhouse.  They were working at the boat a few days after this, caulking, and plugging, and tarring, when Tiny, who had been playing on the sandhills a little way off, came running up breathless with some news.  [Illustration: TINY AND THE OLD MAN. (_See page 130._)]  \"Oh, daddy! there's a little ugly, old man over there, and he says my name is Coomber. Is it, daddy?\"  The fisherman lifted his hat and scratched his head, looking puzzled. Strange to say, this question of the little girl's name had never suggested itself to anybody before, living as they did in this out-of-the-way spot. She was \"Tiny,\" or \"deary,\" or \"the little 'un,\" and no need had arisen for any other name; and so, after scratching his head for a minute, he said: \"Well, deary, if I'm your daddy, I s'pose your name is Coomber. But who is the old man?\" he asked; for it was not often that strangers were seen at Bermuda Point, even in summer-time.  \"I dunno, daddy; but he says he knowed my mother when she was a little gal like me.\"  Coomber dropped the tar-brush he was using, and a spasm of pain crossed his face. Had somebody come to claim the child after all? He instinctively clutched her hand for a minute, but the next he told her to go home, while he went to speak to the stranger.  He found a little, neatly-dressed old man seated on one of the sandhills, and without a word of preface he began:  \"You've come after my little gal, I s'pose?\"  The old man smiled. \"What's your name, my man?\" he said, taking out a pocket-book, and preparing to write.  \"Coomber.\"  \"Coomber!\" exclaimed the old man, dropping his book in his surprise.  \"Why, yes; what should it be?\" said the fisherman. \"Didn't you tell my little Tiny that you knew her name was Coomber? But how you came to know----\"  \"Why, I never saw you before that I know of,\" interrupted the other, sharply; \"so how do you suppose I should know your name? I told the child I knew her name was Matilda Coomber, for she is the very image of her mother when she was a girl, and she was my only daughter.\"  \"Oh, sir, and you've come to fetch her!\" gasped the fisherman.  The stranger took out his snuff-box, and helped himself to a pinch. \"Well, I don't know so much about that,\" he said, cautiously; \"I am her grandfather, and I thought, when I picked up that old newspaper the other day, and read about her being saved, I'd just like to come and have a look at her. I was pretty sure she was my Tilly's little one, by the description of the silver medal she wore, for I'd given it to her mother just before she ran away to get married to that sailor Coomber.\"  \"Oh, sir, a sailor, and his name was Coomber! Where is he? What was he like?\" asked the fisherman, eagerly.  \"He was drowned before his wife died; she never held up her head afterwards, the people tell me. I never saw her after she was married, and swore I'd never help her or hers; but when she was dying she wrote and told me she was leaving a little girl alone in the world, and had left directions for it to be brought to me after her death. With this letter she sent her own portrait, and that of her husband and child, begging me to keep them for the child until she grew up. A day or two after came another letter, saying she was dead, and a neighbour was coming from Grimsby to London by ship, and would bring the child to me; but I never heard or saw anything of either, and concluded she was drowned, when, about a month ago, an old newspaper came in my way, and glancing over it, I saw the account of a little girl being saved from a wreck, and where she might be heard of. I went to the place, and they sent me here, and the minute I saw the child, I knew her for my Tilly's.\"  The old man had talked on, but Coomber had comprehended very little of what was said. He stood looking half-dazed for a minute or two after the stranger had ceased speaking. At length he gathered his wits sufficiently to say: \"Have you got them pictures now?\"  \"Yes,\" said the old man, promptly, taking out his pocket-book as he spoke. \"Here they are; I took care to bring 'em with me;\" and he brought out three photographs.  Coomber seized one instantly. \"It is him! It is my Jack!\" he gasped. \"Oh, sir, tell me more about him.\"  \"I know nothing about him, I tell you,\" said the other, coldly; \"I never saw or spoke to my daughter after she married him; but I'm willing to do something for the little child, seeing it was my girl's last wish.\"  \"The child,\" repeated Coomber. \"Do you mean to say little Tiny is my Jack's child?\"  \"Well, yes, of course I do. What else could I mean?\" replied the other.  \"Then--then I'm her grandfather, and have as much right to her as you have,\" said the fisherman, quickly.  The stranger shrugged his shoulders. \"Well, I s'pose you have,\" he said; \"I'm not going to dispute it. I'm willing to do my duty by her. But mind, I'm not a rich man--not a rich man,\" he added.  Coomber was puzzled for a minute to know what he meant, and was about to say that he wanted no payment for keeping Tiny; but the other lifted his hand in a commanding manner, and exclaimed: \"Now, hear me first. Let me have my say, and then, perhaps, we can come to terms about the matter. You've got a wife, I s'pose, that can look after this child. I haven't; and if she came to me, I shouldn't know what to do with her. Well now, that being the case, she'd better stay here--for the present at least; she's happy enough, I s'pose; and I'll pay you twenty pounds a year as my share towards her expenses.\"  Coomber was about to exclaim indignantly against this, and protest that he would accept no payment; but just then he caught sight of Bob and the old boat, and the thought of what that money would enable him to do kept him silent a little longer.  \"Well now,\" resumed the old man, \"if that plan suits you, we'll come to business at once. You've had her about eighteen months now, so there's about thirty pounds due. You see I'm an honest man, and mean to do the just thing by her,\" he added.  \"Thirty pounds!\" repeated Coomber, to whom such a sum seemed immense wealth. But the other mistook the exclamation for one of discontent, and so he said, quickly, \"Well now, I'll throw you ten pounds in, as I hear you were the one that saved her, and pay you the next six months in advance. That'll make it a round fifty; but I won't go a penny farther. Now will that satisfy you?\"  Satisfy him? Coomber was debating with himself whether he ought to take a farthing, considering what a rich blessing the little girl had been to him. It was only the thought of the bitter winter they had just passed through, and that, if he could get a new boat, he could better provide for the child, that made him hesitate, lest in refusing it he should do Tiny a wrong.  At length, after a pause, during which he had silently lifted his heart in prayer to God, he said: \"Well, sir, for the little 'un's sake I'll take your offer. But, look you, I shall use this money as a loan that is to be returned; and as I can save it, I shall put it in the bank for her.\"  The other shrugged his shoulders. \"You can do as you like about that. I shall come and see the child sometimes, and----\"  \"Do, sir, do, God bless her! To think she's my Jack's child!\" interrupted Coomber, drawing his sleeve across his eyes. \"Do you know, sir, where my boy went down?\" he asked, in a tremulous voice.  But the other shook his head. \"I tell you I know nothing of my daughter after she married; but she sent me a box with some letters and these portraits, and some other odds and ends, to be kept for her little Matilda. I'll send you them if you like;\" and the old man rose as he spoke. \"Can you go with me to Fellness now, and settle this business about the money?\" he added.  \"But don't you want to see Tiny?\" exclaimed Coomber, who could not understand his willingness to give up his claim to the child.  \"I have seen her. We had a long talk here before you came. You may tell her that her Grandfather West will come and see her sometimes. And now, if you'll follow me as quickly as you can to the village, we'll settle this business;\" and as he spoke, Mr. West turned towards the road, leaving Coomber still half-dazed with astonishment.  \"Bob, Bob,\" he called at last, \"I've got to go to the village. A strange thing has happened here to-day, and I want to get my wits a bit together before I tell your mother. But you needn't do much to the boat till I come back, for it may be we shall have a new one after all.\"  Bob looked up in his father's face, speechless with surprise. He spoke of having a new boat as though it was a very sad business. But his next words explained it. \"I've heard of Jack,\" he said; \"no storms will trouble him again;\" and then the fisherman burst forth into heart-breaking sobs and groans, and Bob shed a few tears, although he felt heartily ashamed of them.  \"Now go back, Bob, and tell your mother I've gone to Fellness; and if I ain't home by five o'clock, you come and meet me, for I shall have some money to carry--almost a fortune, Bob.\"  Having heard so much, Bob wanted to hear more, and so walked with his father for the first mile along the road, listening to the strange tale concerning Tiny. Then he went back, and told the news to the astonished group at home; and so, before Coomber returned, his wife had got over the first outburst of grief for the death of her son, and she and Bob had had time to talk calmly over the whole matter. They had decided that the money must be used in such a way as would give the little girl the greatest benefit from it, and that she must go to school, if possible.  \"Now, if dad could buy a share in one of the bigger boats where he and I could work, wouldn't it be better than buying a little one for ourselves?\" suggested Bob; \"then we could go and live at Fellness, and Tiny could go to school--Sunday-school as well as week-day.\"  \"And Dick, too,\" put in Tiny.  \"Yes, and we should all go to God's house on Sunday,\" said Mrs. Coomber, drying her eyes.  Strange to say, a similar project had been suggested to Coomber by his old friend Peters, who knew a man who wanted to sell his share in one of the large fishing-boats, and was asking forty pounds for it.  \"That will leave us ten pounds, mother, to buy the children some new clothes, and take us to Fellness. What do you say to it now?\" asked her husband, after they had talked it over.  \"Why, it seems too good to be true,\" said the poor woman, through her tears. \"But oh! if only poor Jack was here!\" she sighed.  Her husband shook his head, and was silent for a minute or two; but at length he said: \"God has been very good to us when we had no thought of Him. I always knew the little 'un must be a sailor's lass, but to think that she should be our Jack's own child is wonderful. The old gentleman had made quite sure of it before he came here--he wouldn't part with his money unless he'd been sure, I know; and now she's ours, just as much as Dick and Bob is. And we'll take good care of her, God bless her, and Him for sending her to us.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The rest of my story is soon told. The fisherman and his family removed to Fellness, and brighter days dawned for them than they had ever hoped to see. When the box arrived from Mr. West, containing the letter and papers relating to the latter years of their son's life, they found that he had become a true Christian through his wife's influence. He had also learned to read and write; and in the last letter sent to his wife before his death, he told her he meant to go and see his parents as soon as he returned from that voyage. Alas! he never did return; but the \"little lass,\" of whom he spoke so lovingly, became God's messenger to his old home, and the joy and comfort of his parents' hearts.\n\n"

CHAPTER I.  \"GOOD-BYE\" TO THE OLD LIFE.   \"Me want to see Hetty,\" said an imperious baby voice.  \"No, no; not this morning, Miss Nan, dear.\"  \"Me do want to see Hetty,\" was the quick, impatient reply. And a sturdy indignant little face looked up at Nurse, to watch the effect of the last decisive words.  Finding no affirmative reply on Nurse's placid face, the small lips closed firmly--two dimples came and went on two very round cheeks--the mischievous brown eyes grew full of laughter, and the next moment the little questioner had squeezed her way through a slightly open door, and was toddling down the broad stone stairs and across a landing to Hetty's room. The room-door was open, so the truant went in. A bed with the bed-clothes all tossed about, a half worn-out slipper on the floor, a very untidy dressing-table met her eyes, but no Hetty.  \"Me want Hetty, me do,\" piped the treble voice, and then the little feet commenced a careful and watchful pilgrimage, the lips still firmly shut, the dimples coming and going, and the eyes throwing many upward glances in the direction of Nurse and the nursery.  No pursuit as yet, and great, great hope of finding Hetty somewhere in the down-stair regions. Ah, now, how good! those dangerous stairs had been descended, and the little voice calling in shrill tones for Hetty rang out in the wide hall.  \"Let her come to me,\" suddenly said an answering voice, and a girl of about twelve, dressed in deep mourning, suddenly opened the door of a small study and clasped the little one in her arms.  \"So you have found me, my precious, my dearest! Brave, plucky little Nan, you have got away from Nurse and found me out! Come into the study now, darling, and you shall have some breakfast.\"  \"Me want a bicky, Hetty,\" said the baby voice; the round arms clasped Hester's neck, but the brown eyes were already traveling eagerly over the breakfast table in quest of spoil for those rosy little lips.  \"Here are two biscuits, Nan. Nan, look me in the face--here, sit steady on my knee; you love me, don't you, Nan?\"  \"Course me do,\" said the child.  \"And I'm going away from you, Nan, darling. For months and months I won't see anything of you. My heart will be always with you, and I shall think of you morning, noon and night. I love no one as I love you, Nan. You will think of me and love me too; won't you, Nan?\"  \"Me will,\" said Nan; \"me want more bicky, Hetty.\"  \"Yes, yes,\" answered Hester; \"put your arms tight round my neck, and you shall have sugar, too. Tighter than that, Nan, and you shall have two lumps of sugar--oh, yes, you shall--I don't care if it makes you sick--you shall have just what you want the last moment we are together.\"  Baby Nan was only too pleased to crumple up a crape frill and to smear a black dress with sticky little fingers for the sake of the sugar which Hetty plied her with.  \"More, Hetty,\" she said; \"me'll skeeze 'oo vedy tight for more.\"  On this scene Nurse unexpectedly entered.  \"Well, I never! and so you found your way all downstairs by yourself, you little toddle. Now, Miss Hetty, I hope you haven't been giving the precious lamb sugar; you know it never does suit the little dear. Oh, fie! baby; and what sticky hands! Miss Hetty, she has crumpled all your crape frills.\"  \"What matter?\" said Hester. \"I wanted a good hug, and I gave her three or four lumps. Babies won't squeeze you tight for nothing. There, my Nancy, go back to Nurse. Nurse, take her away; I'll break down in a minute if I see her looking at me with that little pout.\"  Nurse took the child into her arms.  \"Good-bye, Miss Hester, dear. Try to be a good girl at school. Take my word, missy--things won't be as dark as they seem.\"  \"Good-bye, Nurse,\" said Hester, hastily. \"Is that you, father? are you calling me?\"  She gathered up her muff and gloves, and ran out of the little study where she had been making believe to eat breakfast. A tall, stern-looking man was in the hall, buttoning on an overcoat; a brougham waited at the door. The next moment Hester and her father were bowling away in the direction of the nearest railway station. Nan's little chubby face had faded from view. The old square, gray house, sacred to Hester because of Nan, had also disappeared; the avenue even was passed, and Hester closed her bright brown eyes. She felt that she was being pushed out into a cold world, and was no longer in the same snug nest with Nan. An intolerable pain was at her heart; she did not glance at her father, who during their entire drive occupied himself over his morning paper. At last they reached the railway station, and just as Sir John Thornton was handing his daughter into a comfortable first-class carriage, marked \"For Ladies only,\" and was presenting her with her railway ticket and a copy of the last week's illustrated newspaper, he spoke:  \"The guard will take care of you, Hester. I am giving him full directions, and he will come to you at every station, and bring you tea or any refreshment you may require. This train takes you straight to Sefton, and Mrs. Willis will meet you, or send for you there. Good-bye, my love; try to be a good girl, and curb your wild spirits. I hope to see you very much improved when you come home at midsummer. Good-bye, dear, good-bye. Ah, you want to kiss me--well, just one kiss. There--oh, my dear! you know I have a great dislike to emotion in public.\"  Sir John Thornton said this because a pair of arms had been flung suddenly round his neck, and two kisses imprinted passionately on his sallow cheek. A tear also rested on his cheek, but that he wiped away.     CHAPTER II.  TRAVELING COMPANIONS.   The train moved rapidly on its way, and the girl in one corner of the railway carriage cried silently behind her crape veil. Her tears were very subdued, but her heart felt sore, bruised, indignant; she hated the idea of school-life before her; she hated the expected restraints and the probable punishments; she fancied herself going from a free life into a prison, and detested it accordingly.  Three months before, Hester Thornton had been one of the happiest, brightest and merriest of little girls in ----shire; but the mother who was her guardian angel, who had kept the frank and spirited child in check without appearing to do so, who had guided her by the magical power of love and not in the least by that of fear, had met her death suddenly by means of a carriage accident, and Hester and baby Nan were left motherless. Several little brothers and sisters had come between Hester and Nan, but from various causes they had all died in their infancy, and only the eldest and youngest of Sir John Thornton's family remained.  Hester's father was stern, uncompromising. He was a very just and upright man, but he knew nothing of the ways of children, and when Hester in her usual tom-boyish fashion climbed trees and tore her dresses, and rode bare-backed on one or two of his most dangerous horses, he not only tried a little sharp, and therefore useless, correction, but determined to take immediate steps to have his wild and rather unmanageable little daughter sent to a first-class school. Hester was on her way there now, and very sore was her heart and indignant her impulses. Father's \"good-bye\" seemed to her to be the crowning touch to her unhappiness, and she made up her mind not to be good, not to learn her lessons, not to come home at midsummer crowned with honors and reduced to an every-day and pattern little girl. No, she would be the same wild Hetty as of yore; and when father saw that school could do nothing for her, that it could never make her into a good and ordinary little girl, he would allow her to remain at home. At home there was at least Nan to love, and there was mother to remember.  Hetty was a child of the strongest feelings. Since her mother's death she had scarcely mentioned her name. When her father alluded to his wife, Hester ran out of the room; when the servants spoke of their late mistress, Hester turned pale, stamped her feet, and told them to be quiet.  \"You are not worthy to speak of my mother,\" she electrified them all one day by exclaiming: \"My mother is an angel now, and you--oh, you are not fit to breathe her name!\"  Only to one person would Hetty ever voluntarily say a word about the beloved dead mother, and that was to little Nan. Nan said her prayers, as she expressed it, to Hetty now; and Hetty taught her a little phrase to use instead of the familiar \"God bless mother.\" She taught the child to say, \"Thank God for making mother into a beautiful angel;\" and when Nan asked what an angel was, and how the cozy mother she remembered could be turned into one, Hester was beguiled into a soft and tearful talk, and she drew several lovely pictures of white-robed angels, until the little child was satisfied and said:  \"Me like that, Hetty--me'll be an angel too, Hetty, same as mamma.\"  These talks with Nan, however, did not come very often, and of late they had almost ceased, for Nan was only two and a half, and the strange, sad fact remained that in three months she had almost forgotten her mother.  Hester on her way to school this morning cried for some time, then she sat silent, her crape veil still down, and her eyes watching furtively her fellow-passengers. They consisted of two rather fidgety old ladies, who wrapped themselves in rugs, were very particular on the question of hot bottles, and watched Hester in their turn with considerable curiosity and interest. Presently one of them offered the little girl a sandwich, which she was too proud or too shy to accept, although by this time she was feeling extremely hungry.  \"You will, perhaps, prefer a cake, my dear?\" said the good-natured little old lady. \"My sister Agnes has got some delicious queen-cakes in her basket--will you eat one?\"  Hester murmured a feeble assent, and the queen-cake did her so much good that she ventured to raise her crape veil and to look around her.  \"Ah, that is much better,\" said the first little old lady. \"Come to this side of the carriage, my love; we are just going to pass through a lovely bit of country, and you will like to watch the view. See; if you place yourself here, my sister Agnes' basket will be just at your feet, and you can help yourself to a queen-cake whenever you are so disposed.\"  \"Thank you,\" responded Hester, in a much more cheerful tone, for it was really quite impossible to keep up reserve with such a bright-looking little old lady; \"your queen-cakes are very nice, and I liked that one, but one is quite enough, thank you. It is Nan who is so particularly fond of queen-cakes.\"  \"And who is Nan, my dear?\" asked the sister to whom the queen-cakes specially belonged.  \"She is my dear little baby sister,\" said Hester in a sorrowful tone.  \"Ah, and it was about her you were crying just now,\" said the first lady, laying her hand on Hester's arm. \"Never mind us, dear, we have seen a great many tears--a great many. They are the way of the world. Women are born to them. As Kingsley says--'women must weep.' It was quite natural that you should cry about your sweet little Nan, and I wish we could send her some of these queen-cakes that you say she is so fond of. Are you going to be long away from her, love?\"  \"Oh, yes, for months and months,\" said Hester. \"I did not know,\" she added, \"that it was such a common thing to cry. I never used to.\"  \"Ah, you have had other trouble, poor child,\" glancing at her deep mourning frock.  \"Yes, it is since then I have cried so often. Please, I would rather not speak about it.\"  \"Quite right, my love, quite right,\" said Miss Agnes in a much brisker tone than her sister. \"We will turn the conversation now to something inspiriting. Jane is quite right, there are plenty of tears in the world; but there is also a great deal of sunshine and heaps of laughter, merry laughter--the laughter of youth, my child. Now, I dare say, though you have begun your journey so sadly, that you are really bound on quite a pleasant little expedition. For instance, you are going to visit a kind aunt, or some one else who will give you a delightful welcome.\"  \"No,\" said Hester, \"I am not. I am going to a dreadful place, and the thought of that, and parting from little Nan, are the reasons why I cried. I am going to prison--I am, indeed.\"  \"Oh, my dear love!\" exclaimed both the little old ladies in a breath. Then Miss Agnes continued: \"You have really taken Jane's breath away--quite. Yes, Jane, I see that you are in for an attack of palpitation. Never mind her, dear, she palpitates very easily; but I think you must be mistaken, my love, in mentioning such an appalling word as 'prison.' Yes, now I come to think of it, it is absolutely certain that you must be mistaken; for if you were going to such a terrible place of punishment you would be under the charge of a policeman. You are given to strong language, dear, like other young folk.\"  \"Well, I call it prison,\" continued Hester, who was rather flattered by all this bustle and Miss Jane's agitation; \"it has a dreadful sound, hasn't it? I call it prison, but father says I am going to school--you can't wonder that I am crying, can you? Oh! what is the matter?\"  For the two little old ladies jumped up at this juncture, and gave Hetty a kiss apiece on her soft, young lips.  \"My darling,\" they both exclaimed, \"we are so relieved and delighted! Your strong language startled us, and school is anything but what you imagine, dear. Ah, Jane! can you ever forget our happy days at school?\"  Miss Jane sighed and rolled up her eyes, and then the two commenced a vigorous catechizing of the little girl. Really Hester could not help feeling almost sunshiny before that long journey came to an end, for she and the Misses Bruce made some delightful discoveries. The little old ladies very quickly found out that they lived close to the school where Hetty was to spend the next few months. They knew Mrs. Willis well--they knew the delightful, rambling, old-fashioned house where Hester was to live--they even knew two or three of the scholars; and they said so often to the little girl that she was going into a life of clover--positive clover--that she began to smile, and even partly to believe them.  \"I am glad I shall be near you, at least,\" she said at last, with a frank sweet smile, for she had greatly taken to her kind fellow-travelers.  \"Yes, my dear,\" exclaimed Miss Jane. \"We attend the same church, and I shall look out for you on Sunday, and,\" she continued, glancing first at her sister and then addressing Hester, \"perhaps Mrs. Willis will allow you to visit us occasionally.\"  \"I'll come to-morrow, if you like,\" said Hester.  \"Well, dear, well--that must be as Mrs. Willis thinks best. Ah, here we are at Sefton at last. We shall look out for you in church on Sunday, my love.\"     CHAPTER III.  AT LAVENDER HOUSE.   Hester's journey had really proved wonderfully agreeable. She had taken a great fancy to the little old ladies who had fussed over her and made themselves pleasant in her behalf. She felt herself something like a heroine as she poured out a little, just a little, of her troubles into their sympathizing ears; and their cheerful remarks with regard to school and school-life had caused her to see clearly that there might be another and a brighter side to the gloomy picture she had drawn with regard to her future.  But during the drive of two and a half miles from Sefton to Lavender House, Hester once more began to feel anxious and troubled. The Misses Bruce had gone off with some other passengers in a little omnibus to their small villa in the town, but Lavender House was some distance off, and the little omnibus never went so far.  An old-fashioned carriage, which the ladies told Hester belonged to Mrs. Willis, had been sent to meet her, and a man whom the Misses Bruce addressed as \"Thomas\" helped to place her trunk and a small portmanteau on the roof of the vehicle. The little girl had to take her drive alone, and the rather ancient horse which drew the old carriage climbed up and down the steep roads in a most leisurely fashion. It was a cold winter's day, and by the time Thomas had executed some commissions in Sefton, and had reached the gates of the avenue which led to Lavender House, it was very nearly dark. Hester trembled at the darkness, and when the gates were shut behind them by a rosy-faced urchin of ten, she once more began to feel the cruel and desolate idea that she was going to prison.  They drove slowly down a long and winding avenue, and, although Hester could not see, she knew they must be passing under trees, for several times their branches made a noise against the roof of the carriage. At last they came to a standstill. The old servant scrambled slowly down from his seat on the box, and, opening the carriage-door, held out his hand to help the little stranger to alight.  \"Come now, missy,\" he said in cheering tones, \"come out, and you'll be warm and snug in a minute. Dear, dear! I expect you're nearly froze up, poor little miss, and it _is_ a most bitter cold night.\"  He rang a bell which hung by the entrance of a deep porch, and the next moment the wide hall-door was flung open by a neat maid-servant, and Hester stepped within.  \"She's come,\" exclaimed several voices in different keys, and proceeding apparently from different quarters. Hester looked around her in a half-startled way, but she could see no one, except the maid, who smiled at her and said:  \"Welcome to Lavender House, miss. If you'll step into the porter's room for one moment, there is a good fire there, and I'll acquaint Miss Danesbury that you have arrived.\"  The little room in question was at the right hand side of a very wide and cheerful hall, which was decorated in pale tints of green, and had a handsome encaustic-tiled floor. A blazing fire and two lamps made the hall look cheerful, but Hester was very glad to take refuge from the unknown voices in the porter's small room. She found herself quite trembling with shyness and cold, and an indescribable longing to get back to Nan; and as she waited for Miss Danesbury and wondered fearfully who or what Miss Danesbury was, she scarcely derived any comfort from the blazing fire near which she stood.  \"Rather tall for her age, but I fear, I greatly fear, a little sulky,\" said a voice behind her; and when she turned round in an agony of trepidation and terror, she suddenly found herself face to face with a tall, kind-looking, middle-aged lady, and also with a bright, gypsy-looking girl.  \"Annie Forest, how very naughty of you to hide behind the door! You are guilty of disobedience in coming into this room without leave. I must report you, my dear; yes, I really must. You lose two good conduct marks for this, and will probably have thirty lines in addition to your usual quantity of French poetry.\"  \"But she won't tell on me, she won't, dear old Danesbury,\" said the girl; \"she couldn't be so hard-hearted, the precious love, particularly as curiosity happens to be one of her own special little virtues! Take a kiss, Danesbury, and now, as you love me you'll be merciful!\" The girl flitted away, and Miss Danesbury turned to Hester, whose face had changed from red to pale during this little scene.  \"What a horrid, vulgar, low-bred girl!\" she exclaimed with passion, for in all the experiences of her short life Hester had never even imagined that personal remarks could be made of any one in their very presence. \"I hope she'll get a lot of punishment--I hope you are not going to forgive her,\" she continued, for her anger had for the time quite overcome her shyness.  \"Oh, my dear, my dear! we should all be forgiving,\" exclaimed Miss Danesbury in her gentle voice. \"Welcome to Lavender House, love; I am sorry I was not in the hall to receive you. Had I been, this little _rencontre_ would not have occurred. Annie Forest meant no harm, however--she's a wild little sprite, but affectionate. You and she will be the best friends possible by-and-by. Now, let me take you to your room; the gong for tea will sound in exactly five minutes, and I am sure you will be glad of something to eat.\"  Miss Danesbury then led Hester across the hall and up some broad, low, thickly-carpeted stairs. When they had ascended two flights, and were standing on a handsome landing, she paused.  \"Do you see this baize door, dear?\" she said. \"This is the entrance to the school part of the house. This part that we are now in belongs exclusively to Mrs. Willis, and the girls are never allowed to come here without leave. All the school life is lived at the other side of this baize door, and a very happy life I assure you it is for those little girls who make up their minds to be brave and good. Now kiss me, my dear, and let me bid you welcome once again to Lavender House.\"  \"Are you our principal teacher, then?\" asked Hester.  \"I? oh, dear, no, my love. I teach the younger children English, and I look after the interests and comforts of all. I am a very useful sort of person, I believe, and I have a motherly heart, dear, and it is a way with little girls to come to me when they are in trouble. Now, my love, we must not chatter any longer. Take my hand, and let us get to your room as fast as possible.\"  Miss Danesbury pushed open the baize door, and instantly Hester found herself in a different region. Mrs. Willis' part of the house gave the impression of warmth, luxuriance, and even elegance of arrangement. At the other side of the door were long, narrow corridors, with snow-white but carpetless floors, and rather cold, distempered walls. Miss Danesbury, holding the new pupil's hand, led her down two corridors, and past a great number of shut doors, behind which Hester could hear suppressed laughter and eager, chattering voices. At last, however, they stopped at a door which had the number \"32\" written over it.  \"This is your bedroom, dear,\" said the English teacher, \"and to-night you will not be sorry to have it alone. Mrs. Willis received a telegram from Susan Drummond, your room-mate, this afternoon, and she will not arrive until to-morrow.\"  However bare and even cold the corridors looked, the bedroom into which Hester was ushered by no means corresponded with this appearance. It was a small, but daintily-furnished little room. The floor was carpeted with green felt, the one window was hung with pretty draperies and two little, narrow, white beds were arranged gracefully with French canopies. All the furniture in the room was of a minute description, but good of its kind. Beside each bed stood a mahogany chest of drawers. At two corresponding corners were marble wash handstands, and even two pretty toilet tables stood side by side in the recess of the window. But the sight that perhaps pleased Hester most was a small bright fire which burned in the grate.  \"Now, dear, this is your room. As you have arrived first you can choose your own bed and your own chest of drawers. Ah, that is right, Ellen has unfastened your portmanteau; she will unpack your trunk to-night, and take it to the box-room. Now, dear, smooth your hair and wash your hands. The gong will sound instantly. I will come for you when it does.\"     CHAPTER IV.  LITTLE DRAWING-ROOMS AND LITTLE TIFFS.   Miss Danesbury, true to her word, came to fetch Hester down to tea. They went down some broad, carpetless stairs, along a wide stone hall, and then paused for an instant at a half-open door from which a stream of eager voices issued.  \"I will introduce you to your schoolfellows, and I hope your future friends,\" said Miss Danesbury. \"After tea you will come with me to see Mrs. Willis--she is never in the school-room at tea-time. Mdlle. Perier or Miss Good usually superintends. Now, my dear, come along--why, surely you are not frightened!\"  \"Oh, please, may I sit near you?\" asked Hester.  \"No, my love; I take care of the little ones, and they are at a table by themselves. Now, come in at once--the moment you dread will soon be over, and it is nothing, my love--really nothing.\"  Nothing! never, as long as Hester lived, did she forget the supreme agony of terror and shyness which came over her as she entered that long, low, brightly-lighted room. The forty pairs of curious eyes which were raised inquisitively to her face became as torturing as forty burning suns. She felt an almost uncontrollable desire to run away and hide--she wondered if she could possibly keep from screaming aloud. In the end she found herself, she scarcely knew how, seated beside a gentle, sweet-mannered girl, and munching bread and butter which tasted drier than sawdust, and occasionally trying to sip something very hot and scalding which she vaguely understood went by the name of tea. The buzzing voices all chattering eagerly in French, and the occasional sharp, high-pitched reprimands coming in peremptory tones from the thin lips of Mdlle. Perier, sounded far off and distant--her head was dizzy, her eyes swam--the tired and shy child endured tortures.  In after-days, in long after-years when the memory of Lavender House was to come back to Hetty Thornton as one of the sweetest, brightest episodes in her existence--in the days when she was to know almost every blade of grass in the gardens, and to be familiar with each corner of the old house, with each face which now appeared so strange, she might wonder at her feelings to-night, but never even then could she forget them.  She sat at the table in a dream, trying to eat the tasteless bread and butter. Suddenly and swiftly the thick and somewhat stale piece of bread on her plate was exchanged for a thin, fresh, and delicately-cut slice.  \"Eat that,\" whispered a voice--\"I know the other is horrid. It's a shame of Perier to give such stuff to a stranger.\"  \"Mdlle. Ccile, you are transgressing: you are talking English,\" came in a torrent of rapid French from the head of the table. \"You lose a conduct mark, ma'amselle.\"  The young girl who sat next Hester inclined her head gently and submissively, and Hester, venturing to glance at her, saw that a delicate pink had spread itself over her pale face. She was a plain girl; but even Hester, in this first moment of terror, could scarcely have been afraid of her, so benign was her expression, so sweet the glance from her soft, full brown eyes. Hester now further observed that the thin bread and butter had been removed from Cecil's own plate. She began to wonder why this girl was indulged with better food than the rest of her comrades.  Hester was beginning to feel a little less shy, and was taking one or two furtive glances at her companions, when she suddenly felt herself turning crimson, and all her agony of shyness and dislike to her school-life returning. She encountered the full, bright, quizzical gaze of the girl who had made personal remarks about her in the porter's room. The merry black eyes of this gypsy maiden fairly twinkled with suppressed fun when they met hers, and the bright head even nodded audaciously across the table to her.  Not for worlds would Hester return this friendly greeting--she still held to her opinion that Miss Forest was one of the most ill-bred people she had ever met, and, in addition to feeling a considerable amount of fear of her, she quite made up her mind that she would never be on friendly terms with so under-bred a girl.  At this moment grace was repeated in sonorous tones by a stern-looking person who sat at the foot of the long table, and whom Hester had not before noticed. Instantly the girls rose from their seats, and began to file in orderly procession out of the tea-room. Hester looked round in terror for the friendly Miss Danesbury, but she could not catch sight of her anywhere. At this moment, however, her companion of the tea-table touched her arm.  \"We may speak English now for half an hour,\" she said, \"and most of us are going to the play-room. We generally tell stories round the fire upon these dark winter's nights. Would you like to come with me to-night? Shall we be chums for this evening?\"  \"I don't know what 'chums' are,\" said Hester; \"but,\" she added, with the dawning of a faint smile on her poor, sad little face, \"I shall be very glad to go with you.\"  \"Come then,\" said Cecil Temple, and she pulled Hester's hand within her arm, and walked with her across the wide stone hall, and into the largest room Hester had ever seen.  Never, anywhere, could there have been a more delightful play-room than this. It was so large that two great fires which burned at either end were not at all too much to emit even tolerable warmth. The room was bright with three or four lamps which were suspended from the ceiling, the floor was covered with matting, and the walls were divided into curious partitions, which gave the room a peculiar but very cosy effect. These partitions consisted of large panels, and were divided by slender rails the one from the other.  \"This is my cosy corner,\" said Cecil, \"and you shall sit with me in it to-night. You see,\" she added, \"each of us girls has her own partition, and we can do exactly what we like in it. We can put our own photographs, our own drawings, our own treasures on our panels. Under each division is our own little work-table, and, in fact, our own individual treasures lie round us in the enclosure of this dear little rail. The center of the room is common property, and you see what a great space there is round each fire-place where we can chatter and talk, and be on common ground. The fire-place at the end of the room near the door is reserved especially for the little ones, but we elder girls sit at the top. Of course you will belong to us. How old are you?\"  \"Twelve,\" said Hester.  \"Oh, well, you are so tall that you cannot possibly be put with the little ones, so you must come in with us.\"  \"And shall I have a railed-in division and a panel of my own?\" asked Hester. \"It sounds a very nice arrangement. I hope my department will be close to yours, Miss ----.\"  \"Temple is my name,\" said Cecil, \"but you need not call me that. I am Cecil to all my friends, and you are my friend this evening, for you are my chum, you know. Oh, you were asking me about our departments--you won't have any at first, for you have got to earn it, but I will invite you to mine pretty often. Come, now, let us go inside. Is not it just like the darlingest little drawing-room? I am so sorry that I have only one easy chair, but you shall have it to-night, and I will sit on this three-legged stool. I am saving up my money to buy another arm-chair, and Annie has promised to upholster it for me.\"  \"Is Annie one of the maids?\"  \"Oh, dear, no! she's dear old Annie Forest, the liveliest girl in the school. Poor darling, she's seldom out of hot water; but we all love her, we can't help it. Poor Annie, she hardly ever has the luxury of a department to herself, so she is useful all round. She's the most amusing and good-natured dear pet in Christendom.\"  \"I don't like her at all,\" said Hester; \"I did not know you were talking of her--she is a most rude, uncouth girl.\"  Cecil Temple, who had been arranging a small dark green table-cloth with daffodils worked artistically in each corner on her little table, stood up as the newcomer uttered these words, and regarded her fixedly.  \"It is a pity to draw hasty conclusions,\" she said. \"There is no girl more loved in the school than Annie Forest. Even the teachers, although they are always punishing her, cannot help having a soft corner in their hearts for her. What can she possibly have done to offend you? but oh! hush--don't speak--she is coming into the room.\"  As Cecil finished her rather eager defense of her friend, and prevented the indignant words which were bubbling to Hester's lips, a gay voice was heard singing a comic song in the passage, the play-room door was flung open with a bang, and Miss Forest entered the room with a small girl seated on each of her shoulders.  \"Hold on, Janny, love; keep your arms well round me, Mabel. Now, then, here we go--twice up the room and down again. No more, as I'm alive. I've got to attend to other matters than you.\"  She placed the little girls on the floor amid peals of laughter, and shouts from several little ones to give them a ride too. The children began to cling to her skirts and to drag her in all directions, and she finally escaped from them with one dexterous bound which placed her in that portion of the play-room where the little ones knew they were not allowed to enter.  Until her arrival the different girls scattered about the large room had been more or less orderly, chattering and laughing together, it is true, but in a quiet manner. Now the whole place appeared suddenly in an uproar.  \"Annie, come here--Annie, darling, give me your opinion about this--Annie, my precious, naughty creature, come and tell me about your last scrape.\"  Annie Forest blew several kisses to her adorers, but did not attach herself to any of them.  \"The Temple requires me,\" she said, in her sauciest tones; \"my beloved friends, the Temple as usual is vouchsafing its sacred shelter to the stranger.\"  In an instant Annie was kneeling inside the enclosure of Miss Temple's rail and laughing immoderately.  \"You dear stranger!\" she exclaimed, turning round and gazing full into Hester's shy face, \"I do declare I have been punished for the intense ardor with which I longed to embrace you. Has she told you, Cecil, darling, what I did in her behalf? How I ventured beyond the sacred precincts of the baize door and hid inside the porter's room? Poor dear, she jumped when she heard my friendly voice, and as I spoke Miss Danesbury caught me in the very act. Poor old dear, she cried when she complained of me, but duty is Danesbury's motto; she would go to the stake for it, and I respect her immensely. I have got my twenty lines of that horrible French poetry to learn--the very thought almost strangles me, and I foresee plainly that I shall do something terribly naughty within the next few hours; I must, my love--I really must. I have just come here to shake hands with Miss Thornton, and then I must away to my penance. Ah, how little I shall learn, and how hard I shall think! Welcome to Lavender House, Miss Thornton; look upon me as your devoted ally, and if you have a spark of pity in your breast, feel for the girl whom you got into a scrape the very moment you entered these sacred walls.\"  \"I don't understand you,\" said Hester, who would not hold out her hand, and who was standing up in a very stiff, shy, and angular position. \"I think you were very rude to startle me, and make personal remarks the very moment I came into the house.\"  \"Oh, dear! I only said you were tall, and looked rather sulky, love--you did, you know, really.\"  \"It was very rude of you,\" repeated Hester, turning crimson, and trying to keep back her tears.  \"Well, my dear, I meant no harm; shake hands, now, and let us make friends.\"  But Hester felt either too shy or too miserable to yield to this request--she half turned her back, and leaned against Miss Temple's panel.  \"Never mind her,\" whispered gentle Cecil Temple; but Annie Forest's bright face had darkened ominously--the school favorite was not accustomed to having her advances flung back in her face. She left the room singing a defiant, naughty song, and several of the girls who had overheard this scene whispered one to the other:  \"She can't be at all nice--she would not even shake hands with Annie. Fancy her turning against our Annie in that way!\"     CHAPTER V.  THE HEAD-MISTRESS.   Annie Forest had scarcely left the room before Miss Danesbury appeared with a message for Hester, who was to come with her directly to see Mrs. Willis. The poor shy girl felt only too glad to leave behind her the cruel, staring, and now by no means approving eyes of her schoolmates. She had overheard several of their whispers, and felt rather alarmed at her own act. But Hester, shy as she was, could be very tenacious of an idea. She had taken a dislike to Annie Forest, and she was quite determined to be true to what she considered her convictions--namely, that Annie was under-bred and common, and not at all the kind of girl whom her mother would have cared for her to know. The little girl followed Miss Danesbury in silence. They crossed the stone hall together, and now passing through another baize door, found themselves once more in the handsome entrance-hall. They walked across this hall to a door carefully protected from all draughts by rich plush curtains, and Miss Danesbury, turning the handle, and going a step or two into the room, said in her gentle voice:  \"I have brought Hester Thornton to see you, Mrs. Willis, according to your wish.\"  Miss Danesbury then withdrew, and Hester ventured to raise her eyes and to look timidly at the head-mistress.  A tall woman, with a beautiful face and silvery white hair, came instantly to meet her, laid her two hands on the girl's shoulders, and then, raising her shy little face, imprinted a kiss on her forehead.  \"Your mother was one of my earliest pupils, Hester,\" she said, \"and you are--no\"--after a pause, \"you are not very like her. You are her child, however, my dear, and as such you have a warm welcome from me. Now, come and sit by the fire, and let us talk.\"  Hester did not feel nearly so constrained with this graceful and gracious lady as she had done with her schoolmates. The atmosphere of the room recalled her beloved mother's boudoir at home. The rich dove-colored satin dress, the cap made of Mechlin lace which softened and shaded Mrs. Willis' silvery hair, appeared homelike to the little girl, who had grown up accustomed to all the luxuries of wealth. Above all, the head-mistress' mention of her mother drew her heart toward the beautiful face, and attracted her toward the rich, full tones of a voice which could be powerful and commanding at will. Mrs. Willis, notwithstanding her white hair, had a youthful face, and Hester made the comment which came first to her lips:  \"I did not think you were old enough to have taught my mother.\"  \"I am sixty, dear, and I have kept this school for thirty years. Your mother was not the only pupil who sent her children to be taught by me when the time came. Now, you can sit on this stool by the fire and tell me about your home. Your mother--ah, poor child, you would rather not talk about her just yet. Helen's daughter must have strong feelings--ah, yes; I see, I see. Another time, darling, when you know me better. Now tell me about your little sister, and your father. You do not know, perhaps, that I am Nan's godmother?\"  After this the head-mistress and the new pupil had a long conversation. Hester forgot her shyness; her whole heart had gone out instantly to this beautiful woman who had known, and loved, and taught her mother.  \"I will try to be good at school,\" she said at last; \"but, oh, please, Mrs. Willis, it does not seem to me to-night as if school-life could be happy.\"  \"It has its trials, Hester; but the brave and the noble girls often find this time of discipline one of the best in their lives--good at the time, very good to look back on by-and-by. You will find a miniature world around you; you will be surrounded by temptations; and you will have rare chances of proving whether your character can be strong and great and true. I think, as a rule, my girls are happy, and as a rule they turn out well. The great motto of life here, Hester, is earnestness. We are earnest in our work, we are earnest in our play. A half-hearted girl has no chance at Lavender House. In play-time, laugh with the merriest, my child; in school-hours, study with the most studious. Do you understand me?\"  \"I try to, a little,\" said Hester, \"but it seems all very strange just now.\"  \"No doubt it does, and at first you will have to encounter many perplexities and to fight many battles. Never mind, if you have the right spirit within you, you will come out on the winning side. Now, tell me, have you made any acquaintances as yet among the girls?\"  \"Yes--Cecil Temple has been kind to me.\"  \"Cecil is one of my dearest pupils; cultivate her friendship, Hester--she is honorable, she is sympathizing. I am not afraid to say that Cecil has a great heart.\"  \"There is another girl,\" continued Hester, \"who has spoken to me. I need not make her my friend, need I?\"  \"Who is she, dear?\"  \"Miss Forest--I don't like her.\"  \"What! our school favorite. You will change your mind, I expect--but that is the gong for prayers. You shall come with me to chapel, to-night, and I will introduce you to Mr. Everard.\"     CHAPTER VI.  \"I AM UNHAPPY.\"   Between forty and fifty young girls assembled night and morning for prayers in the pretty chapel which adjoined Lavender House. This chapel had been reconstructed from the ruins of an ancient priory, on the site of which the house was built. The walls, and even the beautiful eastern window, belonged to a far-off date. The roof had been carefully reared in accordance with the style of the east window, and the whole effect was beautiful and impressive. Mrs. Willis was particularly fond of her own chapel. Here she hoped the girls' best lessons might be learned, and here she had even once or twice brought a refractory pupil, and tried what a gentle word or two spoken in these old and sacred walls might effect. Here, on wet Sundays the girls assembled for service; and here, every evening at nine o'clock, came the vicar of the large parish to which Lavender House belonged, to conduct evening prayers. He was an old man, and a great friend of Mrs. Willis', and he often told her that he considered these young girls some of the most important members of his flock.  Here Hester knelt to-night. It is to be doubted whether in her confusion, and in the strange loneliness which even Mrs. Willis had scarcely removed, she prayed much. It is certain she did not join in the evening hymn, which, with the aid of an organ and some sweet girl-voices, was beautifully and almost pathetically rendered. After evening prayers had come to an end, Mrs. Willis took Hester's hand and led her up to the old, white-headed vicar.  \"This is my new pupil, Mr. Everard, or rather I should say, our new pupil. Her education depends as much on you as on me.\"  The vicar held out his hands, and took Hester's within them, and then drew her forward to the light.  \"This little face does not seem quite strange to me,\" he said. \"Have I ever seen you before, my dear?\"  \"No, sir,\" replied Hester.  \"You have seen her mother,\" said Mrs. Willis--\"Do you remember your favorite pupil, Helen Anstey, of long ago?\"  \"Ah! indeed--indeed! I shall never forget Helen. And are you her child, little one?\"  But Hester's face had grown white. The solemn service in the chapel, joined to all the excitement and anxieties of the day, had strung up her sensitive nerves to a pitch higher than she could endure. Suddenly, as the vicar spoke to her, and Mrs. Willis looked kindly down at her new pupil, the chapel seemed to reel round, the pupils one by one disappeared, and the tired girl only saved herself from fainting by a sudden burst of tears.  \"Oh, I am unhappy,\" she sobbed, \"without my mother! Please, please, don't talk to me about my mother.\"  She could scarcely take in the gentle words which her two friends said to her, and she hardly noticed when Mrs. Willis did such a wonderful thing as to stoop down and kiss a second time the lips of a new pupil.  Finally she found herself consigned to Miss Danesbury's care, who hurried her off to her room, and helped her to undress and tucked her into her little bed.  \"Now, love, you shall have some hot gruel. No, not a word. You ate little or no tea to-night--I watched you from my distant table. Half your loneliness is caused by want of food--I know it, my love; I am a very practical person. Now, eat your gruel, and then shut your eyes and go to sleep.\"  \"You are very kind to me,\" said Hester, \"and so is Mrs. Willis, and so is Mr. Everard, and I like Cecil Temple--but, oh, I wish Annie Forest was not in the school!\"  \"Hush, my dear, I implore of you. You pain me by these words. I am quite confident that Annie will be your best friend yet.\"  Hester's lips said nothing, but her eyes answered \"Never\" as plainly as eyes could speak.     CHAPTER VII.  A DAY AT SCHOOL.   If Hester Thornton went to sleep that night under a sort of dreamy, hazy impression that school was a place without a great deal of order, with many kind and sympathizing faces, and with some not so agreeable; if she went to sleep under the impression that she had dropped into a sort of medley, that she had found herself in a vast new world where certain personages exercised undoubtedly a strong moral influence, but where on the whole a number of other people did pretty much what they pleased--she awoke in the morning to find her preconceived ideas scattered to the four winds.  There was nothing of apparent liberty about the Lavender House arrangements in the early morning hours. In the first place, it seemed quite the middle of the night when Hester was awakened by a loud gong, which clanged through the house and caused her to sit up in bed in a considerable state of fright and perplexity. A moment or two later a neatly-dressed maid-servant came into the room with a can of hot water; she lit a pair of candles on the mantel-piece, and, with the remark that the second gong would sound in half an hour, and that all the young ladies would be expected to assemble in the chapel at seven o'clock precisely, she left the room.  Hester pulled her pretty little gold watch from under her pillow, and saw with a sigh that it was now half-past six.  \"What odious hours they keep in this horrid place!\" she said to herself. \"Well, well, I always did know that school would be unendurable.\"  She waited for five minutes before she got up, and then she dressed herself languidly, and, if the truth must be told, in a very untidy fashion. She managed to be dressed by the time the second gong sounded, but she had only one moment to give to her private prayers. She reflected, however, that this did not greatly matter as she was going down to prayers immediately in the chapel.  The service in the chapel the night before had impressed her more deeply than she cared to own, and she followed her companions down stairs with a certain feeling of pleasure at the thought of again seeing Mr. Everard and Mrs. Willis. She wondered if they would take much notice of her this morning, and she thought it just possible that Mr. Everard, who had looked at her so compassionately the night before, might be induced, for the sake of his old friendship with her mother, to take her home with him to spend the day. She thought she would rather like to spend a day with Mr. Everard, and she fancied he was the sort of person who would influence her and help her to be good. Hester fancied that if some very interesting and quite out of the common person took her in hand, she might be formed into something extremely noble--noble enough even to forgive Annie Forest.  The girls all filed into the chapel, which was lighted as brightly and cheerily as the night before; but Hester found herself placed on a bench far down in the building. She was no longer in the place of honor by Mrs. Willis' side. She was one of a number, and no one looked particularly at her or noticed her in any way. A shy young curate read the morning prayers; Mr. Everard was not present, and Mrs. Willis, who was, walked out of the chapel when prayers were over without even glancing in Hester's direction. This was bad enough for the poor little dreamer of dreams, but worse was to follow.  Mrs. Willis did not speak to Hester, but she did stop for an instant beside Annie Forest. Hester saw her lay her white hand on the young girl's shoulder and whisper for an instant in her ear. Annie's lovely gypsy face flushed a vivid crimson.  \"For your sake, darling,\" she whispered back; but Hester caught the words, and was consumed by a fierce jealousy.  The girls went into the school-room, where Mdlle. Perier gave a French lesson to the upper class. Hester belonged to no class at present, and could look around her, and have plenty of time to reflect on her own miseries, and particularly on what she now considered the favoritism shown by Mrs. Willis.  \"Mr. Everard at least will read through that girl,\" she said to herself; \"he could not possibly endure any one so loud. Yes, I am sure that my only friend at home, Cecilia Day, would call Annie very loud. I wonder Mrs. Willis can endure her. Mrs. Willis seems so ladylike herself, but--Oh, I beg your pardon, what's the matter?\"  A very sharp voice had addressed itself to the idle Hester.  \"But, mademoiselle, you are doing nothing! This cannot for a moment be permitted. Pardonnez-moi, you know not the French? Here is a little easy lesson. Study it, mademoiselle, and do not let your eyes wander a moment from the page.\"  Hester favored Mdlle. Perier with a look of lofty contempt, but she received the well-thumbed lesson-book in absolute silence.  At eight o'clock came breakfast, which was nicely served, and was very good and abundant. Hester was thoroughly hungry this morning, and did not feel so shy as the night before. She found herself seated between two strange girls, who talked to her a little and would have made themselves friendly had she at all encouraged them to do so. After breakfast came half an hour's recreation, when, the weather being very bad, the girls again assembled in the cozy play-room. Hester looked round eagerly for Cecil Temple, who greeted her with a kind smile, but did not ask her into her enclosure. Annie Forest was not present, and Hester breathed a sigh of relief at her absence. The half-hour devoted to recreation proved rather dull to the newcomer. Hester could not understand her present world. To the girl who had been brought up practically as an only child in the warm shelter of a home, the ways and doings of school-girl life were an absolute enigma.  Hester had no idea of unbending or of making herself agreeable. The girls voted her to one another stiff and tiresome, and quickly left her to her own devices. She looked longingly at Cecil Temple; but Cecil, who could never be knowingly unkind to any one, was seizing the precious moments to write a letter to her father, and Hester presently wandered down the room and tried to take an interest in the little ones. From twelve to fifteen quite little children were in the school, and Hester wondered with a sort of vague half-pain if she might see any child among the group the least like Nan.  \"They will like to have me with them,\" she said to herself. \"Poor little dots, they always like big girls to notice them, and didn't they make a fuss about Miss Forest last night! Well, Nan is fond enough of me, and little children find out so quickly what one is really like.\"  Hester walked boldly into the group. The little dots were all as busy as bees, were not the least lonely, or the least shy, and very plainly gave the intruder to understand that they would prefer her room to her company. Hester was not proud with little children--she loved them dearly. Some of the smaller ones in question were beautiful little creatures, and her heart warmed to them for Nan's sake. She could not stoop to conciliate the older girls, but she could make an effort with the babies. She knelt on the floor and took up a headless doll.  \"I know a little girl who had a doll like that,\" she said. Here she paused and several pairs of eyes were fixed on her.  \"Poor dolly's b'oke,\" said the owner of the headless one in a tone of deep commiseration.  \"You _are_ such a breaker, you know, Annie,\" said Annie's little five-year-old sister.  \"Please tell us about the little girl what had the doll wifout the head,\" she proceeded, glancing at Hester.  \"Oh, it was taken to a hospital, and got back its head,\" said Hester quite cheerfully; \"it became quite well again, and was a more beautiful doll than ever.\"  This announcement caused intense wonder and was certainly carrying the interest of all the little ones. Hester was deciding that the child who possessed the headless doll _had_ a look of Nan about her dark brown eyes, when suddenly there was a diversion--the play-room door was opened noisily, banged-to with a very loud report, and a gay voice sang out:  \"The fairy queen has just paid me a visit. Who wants sweeties from the fairy queen?\"  Instantly all the little feet had scrambled to the perpendicular, each pair of hands was clapped noisily, each little throat shouted a joyful:  \"Here comes Annie!\"  Annie Forest was surrounded, and Hester knelt alone on the hearth-rug.  She felt herself coloring painfully--she did not fail to observe that two laughing eyes had fixed themselves with a momentary triumph on her face; then, snatching up a book, which happened to lie close, she seated herself with her back to all the girls, and her head bent over the page. It is quite doubtful whether she saw any of the words, but she was at least determined not to cry.  The half-hour so wearisome to poor Hester came to an end, and the girls, conducted by Miss Danesbury, filed into the school-room and took their places in the different classes.  Work had now begun in serious earnest. The school-room presented an animated and busy scene. The young faces with their varying expressions betokened on the whole the preponderance of an earnest spirit. Discipline, not too severe, reigned triumphant.  Hester was not yet appointed to any place among these busy workers, but while she stood wondering, a little confused, and half intending to drop into an empty seat which happened to be close, Miss Danesbury came up to her.  \"Follow me, Miss Thornton,\" she said, and she conducted the young girl up the whole length of the great school-room, and pushed aside some baize curtains which concealed a second smaller room, where Mrs. Willis sat before a desk.  The head-mistress was no longer dressed in soft pearl-gray and Mechlin lace. She wore a black silk dress, and her white cap seemed to Hester to add a severe tone to her features. She neither shook hands with the new pupil nor kissed her, but said instantly in a bright though authoritative tone:  \"I must now find out as quickly as possible what you know, Hester, in order to place you in the most suitable class.\"  Hester was a clever girl, and passed through the ordeal of a rather stiff examination with considerable ability. Mrs. Willis pronounced her English and general information quite up to the usual standard for girls of her age--her French was deficient, but she showed some talent for German.  \"On the whole I am pleased with your general intelligence, and I think you have good capacities, Hester,\" she said in conclusion. \"I shall ask Miss Good, our very accomplished English teacher, to place you in the third class. You will have to work very hard, however, at your French, to maintain your place there. But Mdlle. Perier is kind and painstaking, and it rests with yourself to quickly acquire a conversational acquaintance with the language. You are aware that, except during recreation, you are never allowed to speak in any other tongue. Now, go back to the school-room, my dear.\"  As Mrs. Willis spoke she laid her finger on a little silver gong which stood by her side.  \"One moment, please,\" said Hester, coloring crimson; \"I want to ask you a question, please.\"  \"Is it about your lessons?\"  \"No--oh, no; it is----\"  \"Then pardon me, my dear,\" uttered the governess; \"I sit in my room every evening from eight to half-past, and I am then at liberty to see a pupil on any subject which is not trifling. Nothing but lessons are spoken of in lesson hours, Hester. Ah, here comes Miss Good. Miss Good, I should wish you to place Hester Thornton in the third class. Her English is up to the average. I will see Mdlle. Perier about her at twelve o'clock.\"  Hester followed the English teacher into the great school-room, took her place in the third class, at the desk which was pointed out to her, was given a pile of new books, and was asked to attend to the history lesson which was then going on.  Notwithstanding her confusion, a certain sense of soreness, and some indignation at what she considered Mrs. Willis' altered manner, she acquitted herself with considerable spirit, and was pleased to see that her class companions regarded her with some respect.  An English literature lecture followed the history, and here again Hester acquitted herself with _clat_. The subject to-day was \"Julius Csar,\" and Hester had read Shakespeare's play over many times with her mother.  But when the hour came for foreign languages, her brief triumph ceased. Lower and lower did she fall in her schoolfellows' estimation as she stumbled through her truly English-French. Mdlle. Perier, who was a very fiery little woman, almost screamed at her--the girls colored and nearly tittered. Hester hoped to recover her lost laurels in German, but by this time her head ached and she did very little better in the German which she loved than in the French which she detested. At twelve o'clock she was relieved to find that school was over for the present, and she heard the English teacher's voice desiring the girls to go quickly to their rooms, and to assemble in five minutes' time in the great stone hall, equipped for their walk.  The walk lasted for a little over an hour, and was a very dreary penance to poor Hester, as she was neither allowed to run, race, nor talk a word of English. She sighed heavily once or twice, and several of the girls who looked at her curiously agreed with Annie Forest that she was decidedly sulky. The walk was followed by dinner; then came half an hour of recreation in the delightful play-room, and eager chattering in the English tongue.  At three o'clock the school assembled once more; but now the studies were of a less severe character, and Hester spent one of her first happy half-hours over a drawing lesson. She had a great love for drawing, and felt some pride in the really beautiful copy which she was making of the stump of an old gnarled oak-tree. Her dismay, however, was proportionately great when the drawing-master drew his pencil right across her copy.  \"I particularly requested you not to sketch in any of the shadows, Miss Thornton. Did you not hear me say that my lesson to-day was in outline? I gave you a shaded piece to copy in outline--did you not understand?\"  \"This is my first day at school,\" whispered back poor Hester, speaking in English in her distress. Whereupon the master smiled, and even forgot to report her for her transgression of the French tongue.  Hester spent the rest of that afternoon over her music lesson. The music-master was an irascible little German, but Hester played with some taste, and was therefore not too severely rapped over the knuckles.  Then came tea and another half-hour of recreation, which was followed by two silent hours in the school-room, each girl bent busily over her books in preparation for the next day's work. Hester studied hard, for she had made up her mind to be the intellectual prodigy of the school. Even on this first day, miserable as it was, she had won a few plaudits for her quickness and powers of observation. How much better could she work when she had really fallen into the tone of the school, and understood the lessons which she was now so carefully preparing! During her busy day she had failed to notice one thing: namely, the absence of Annie Forest. Annie had not been in the school-room, had not been in the play-room; but now, as the clock struck eight, she entered the school-room with a listless expression, and took her place in the same class with Hester. Her eyes were heavy, as if she had been crying, and when a companion touched her, and gave her a sympathizing glance, she shook her head with a sorrowful gesture, but did not speak. Glasses of milk and slices of bread and butter were now handed round to the girls, and Miss Danesbury asked if any one would like to see Mrs. Willis before prayers. Hester half sprang to her feet, but then sat down again. Mrs. Willis had annoyed her by refusing to break her rules and answer her question during lesson hours. No, the silly child resolved that she would not trouble Mrs. Willis now.  \"No one to-night, then?\" said Miss Danesbury, who had noticed Hester's movement.  Suddenly Annie Forest sprang to her feet.  \"I'm going, Miss Danesbury,\" she said. \"You need not show me the way; I can find it alone.\"  With her short, curly hair falling about her face, she ran out of the room.     CHAPTER VIII.  \"YOU HAVE WAKED ME TOO SOON.\"   When Hester reached her bedroom after prayers on that second evening, she was dismayed to find that she no longer could consider the pretty little bedroom her own. It had not only an occupant, but an occupant who had left untidy traces of her presence on the floor, for a stocking lay in one direction and a muddy boot sprawled in another. The newcomer had herself got into bed, where she lay with a quantity of red hair tossed about on the pillow, and a heavy freckled face turned upward, with the eyes shut and the mouth slightly open.  As Hester entered the room, from these parted lips came unmistakable and loud snores. She stood still dismayed.  \"How terrible!\" she said to herself; \"oh, what a girl! I cannot sleep in the room with any one who snores--I really cannot!\"  She stood perfectly still, with her hands clasped before her, and her eyes fixed with almost ludicrous dismay on this unexpected trial. As she gazed, a fresh discovery caused her to utter an exclamation of horror aloud.  The newcomer had curled herself up comfortably in _her_ bed. Suddenly, to her surprise, a voice said very quietly, without a flicker of expression coming over the calm face, or the eyes even making an effort to open:  \"Are you my new schoolmate?\"  \"Yes,\" said Hester, \"I am sorry to say I am.\"  \"Oh, don't be sorry, there's a good creature; there's nothing to be sorry about. I'll stop snoring when I turn on my side--it's all right. I always snore for half an hour to rest my back, and the time is nearly up. Don't trouble me to open my eyes, I am not the least curious to see you. You have a cross voice, but you'll get used to me after a bit.\"  \"But you're in my bed,\" said Hester. \"Will you please to get into your own?\"  \"Oh, no, don't ask me; I like your bed best. I slept in it the whole of last term. I changed the sheets myself, so it does not matter. Do you mind putting my muddy boots outside the door, and folding up my stockings? I forgot them, and I shall have a bad mark if Danesbury comes in. Good-night--I'm turning on my side--I won't snore any more.\"  The heavy face was now only seen in profile, and Hester, knowing that Miss Danesbury would soon appear to put out the candle, had to hurry into the other bed as fast as she could; something impelled her, however, to take up the muddy boots with two very gingerly fingers, and place them outside the door.  She slept better this second night, and was not quite so startled the next morning when the remorseless gong aroused her from slumber. The maid-servant came in as usual to light the candles, and to place two cans of hot water by the two wash-hand stands.  \"You are awake, miss?\" she said to Hester.  \"Oh, yes,\" replied Hester almost cheerfully.  \"Well, that's all right,\" said the servant. \"Now I must try and rouse Miss Drummond, and she always takes a deal of waking; and if you don't mind, miss, it will be an act of kindness to call out to her in the middle of your own dressing--that is, if I don't wake her effectual.\"  With these words, the housemaid approached the bed where the red-haired girl lay again on her back, and again snoring loudly.  \"Miss Drummond, wake, miss; it's half-past six. Wake up, miss--I have brought your hot water.\"  \"Eh?--what?\" said the voice in the bed, sleepily; \"don't bother me, Hannah--I--I've determined not to ride this morning; go away\"--then more sleepily, and in a lower key, \"Tell Percy he can't bring the dogs in here.\"  \"I ain't neither your Hannah, nor your Percy, nor one of the dogs,\" replied the rather irate Alice. \"There, get up, miss, do. I never see such a young lady for sleeping--never.\"  \"I won't be bothered,\" said the occupant of the bed, and now she turned deliberately on her side and snored more loudly than ever.  \"There's no help for it,\" said Alice: \"I have to do it nearly every morning, so don't you be startled, miss. Poor thing, she would never have a good conduct mark but for me. Now then, here goes. You needn't be frightened, miss--she don't mind it the least bit in the world.\"  Here Alice seized a rough Turkish towel, placed it under the sleepy head with its shock of red hair, and, dipping a sponge in a basin of icy cold water, dashed it on the white face.  This remedy proved effectual: two large pale blue eyes opened wide, a voice said in a tranquil and unmoved tone:  \"Oh, thank you, Alice. So I'm back at this horrid, detestable school again!\"  \"Get your feet well on the carpet, Miss Drummond, before you falls off again,\" said the servant. \"Now then, you'd better get dressed as fast as possible, miss--you have lost five minutes already.\"  Hester, who had laughed immoderately during this little scene, was already up and going through the processes of her toilet. Miss Drummond, seated on the edge of her bed, regarded her with sleepy eyes.  \"So you are my new room-mate?\" she said. \"What's your name?\"  \"Hester Thornton,\" replied Hetty with dignity.  \"Oh--I'm Susy Drummond--you may call me Susy if you like.\"  Hester made no response to this gracious invitation.  Miss Drummond sat motionless, gazing down at her toes.  \"Had not you better get dressed?\" said Hester after a long pause, for she really feared the young lady would fall asleep where she was sitting.  Miss Drummond started.  \"Dressed! So I will, dear creature. Have the sweet goodness to hand me my clothes.\"  \"Where are they?\" asked Hester rather crossly, for she did not care to act as lady's-maid.  \"They are over there, on a chair, in that lovely heap with a shawl flung over them. There, toss them this way--I'll get into them somehow.\"  Miss Drummond did manage to get into her garments; but her whole appearance was so heavy and untidy when she was dressed, that Hester by the very force of contrast felt obliged to take extra pains with her own toilet.  \"Now, that's a comfort,\" said Susan, \"I'm in my clothes. How bitter it is! There's one comfort, the chapel will be warm. I often catch forty winks in chapel--that is, if I'm lucky enough to get behind one of the tall girls, where Mrs. Willis won't see me. It does seem to me,\" continued Susan in a meditative tone, \"the strangest thing why girls are not allowed sleep enough.\"  Hester was pinning a clean collar round her neck when Miss Drummond came up close, leaned over the dressing-table, and regarded her with languid curiosity.  \"A penny for your thoughts, Miss Prunes and Prism.\"  \"Why do you call me that?\" said Hester angrily.  \"Because you look like it, sweet. Now, don't be cross, little pet--no one ever yet was cross with sleepy Susy Drummond. Now, tell me, love, what had you for breakfast yesterday?\"  \"I'm sure I forget,\" said Hester.  \"You _forget_?--how extraordinary! You're sure that it was not buttered scones? We have them sometimes, and I tell you they are enough even to keep a girl awake. Well, at least you can let me know if the eggs were very stale, and the coffee very weak, and whether the butter was second-rate Dorset, or good and fresh. Come now--my breakfast is of immense importance to me, I assure you.\"  \"I dare say,\" answered Hester. \"You can see for yourself this morning what is on the table--I can only inform you that it was good enough for me, and that I don't remember what it was.\"  \"Oh, dear!\" exclaimed Susan Drummond, \"I'm afraid she has a little temper of her own--poor little room-mate. I wonder if chocolate-creams would sweeten that little temper.\"  \"Please don't talk--I'm going to say my prayers,\" said Hester.  She did kneel down, and made a slight effort to ask God to help her through the day's work and the day's play. In consequence, she rose from her knees with a feeling of strength and sweetness which even the feeblest prayer when uttered in earnest can always give.  The prayer-gong now sounded, and all the girls assembled in the chapel. Miss Drummond was greeted by many appreciative nods, and more than one pair of longing eyes gazed in the direction of her pockets, which stuck out in the most ungainly fashion.  Hester was relieved to find that her room-mate did not share her class in school, nor sit anywhere near her at table.  When the half-hour's recreation after breakfast arrived, Hester, determined to be beholden to none of her schoolmates for companionship, seated herself comfortably in an easy chair with a new book. Presently she was startled by a little stream of lollipops falling in a shower over her head, down her neck, and into her lap. She started up with an expression of disgust. Instantly Miss Drummond sank into the vacated chair.  \"Thank you, love,\" she said, in a cozy, purring voice. \"Eat your lollipops, and look at me; I'm going to sleep. Please pull my toe when Danesbury comes in. Oh, fie! Prunes and Prisms--not so cross--eat your lollipops; they will sweeten the expression of that--little--face.\"  The last words came out drowsily. As she said \"face,\" Miss Drummond's languid eyes were closed--she was fast asleep.     CHAPTER IX.  WORK AND PLAY.   In a few days Hester was accustomed to her new life. She fell into its routine, and in a certain measure won the respect of her fellow-pupils. She worked hard, and kept her place in class, and her French became a little more like the French tongue and a little less like the English. She showed marked ability in many of her other studies, and the mistresses and masters spoke well of her. After a fortnight spent at Lavender House, Hester had to acknowledge that the little Misses Bruce were right, and that school might be a really enjoyable place for some girls. She would not yet admit that it could be enjoyable for her. Hester was too shy, too proud, too exacting to be popular with her schoolfellows. She knew nothing of school-girl life--she had never learned the great secret of success in all life's perplexities, the power to give and take. It never occurred to Hester to look over a hasty word, to take no notice of an envious or insolent look. As far as her lessons were concerned, she was doing well; but the hardest lesson of all, the training of mind and character, which the daily companionship of her schoolfellows alone could give her, in this lesson she was making no way. Each day she was shutting herself up more and more from all kindly advances, and the only one in the school whom she sincerely and cordially liked was gentle Cecil Temple.  Mrs. Willis had some ideas with regard to the training of her young people which were peculiarly her own. She had found them successful, and, during her thirty years' experience, had never seen reason to alter them. She was determined to give her girls a great deal more liberty than was accorded in most of the boarding-schools of her day. She never made what she called impossible rules; she allowed the girls full liberty to chatter in their bedrooms; she did not watch them during play-hours; she never read the letters they received, and only superintended the specimen home letter which each girl was required to write once a month. Other head-mistresses wondered at the latitude she allowed her girls, but she invariably replied:  \"I always find it works best to trust them. If a girl is found to be utterly untrustworthy, I don't expel her, but I request her parents to remove her to a more strict school.\"  Mrs. Willis also believed much in that quiet half-hour each evening, when the girls who cared to come could talk to her alone. On these occasions she always dropped the school-mistress and adopted the _rle_ of the mother. With a very refractory pupil she spoke in the tenderest tones of remonstrance and affection at these times. If her words failed--if the discipline of the day and the gentle sympathy of these moments at night did not effect their purpose, she had yet another expedient--the vicar was asked to see the girl who would not yield to this motherly influence.  Mr. Everard had very seldom taken Mrs. Willis' place. As he said to her: \"Your influence must be the mainspring. At supreme moments I will help you with personal influence, but otherwise, except for my nightly prayers with your girls, and my weekly class, and the teachings which they with others hear from my lips Sunday after Sunday, they had better look to you.\"  The girls knew this rule well, and the one or two rare instances in the school history where the vicar had stepped in to interfere, were spoken of with bated breath and with intense awe.  Mrs. Willis had a great idea of bringing as much happiness as possible into young lives. It was with this idea that she had the quaint little compartments railed off in the play-room.  \"For the elder girls,\" she would say, \"there is no pleasure so great as having, however small the spot, a little liberty hall of their own. In her compartment each girl is absolute monarch. No one can enter inside the little curtained rail without her permission. Here she can show her individual taste, her individual ideas. Here she can keep her most prized possessions. In short, her compartment in the play-room is a little home to her.\"  The play-room, large as it was, admitted of only twenty compartments; these compartments were not easily won. No amount of cleverness attained them; they were altogether dependent on conduct. No girl could be the honorable owner of her own little drawing-room until she had distinguished herself by some special act of kindness and self-denial. Mrs. Willis had no fixed rule on this subject. She alone gave away the compartments, and she often made choice of girls on whom she conferred this honor in a way which rather puzzled and surprised their fellows.  When the compartment was won it was not a secure possession. To retain it depended also on conduct; and here again Mrs. Willis was absolute in her sway. More than once the girls had entered the room in the morning to find some favorite's furniture removed and her little possessions taken carefully down from the walls, the girl herself alone knowing the reason for this sudden change. Annie Forest, who had been at Lavender House for four years, had once, for a solitary month of her existence, owned her own special drawing-room. She had obtained it as a reward for an act of heroism. One of the little pupils had set her pinafore on fire. There was no teacher present at the moment, the other girls had screamed and run for help, but Annie, very pale, had caught the little one in her arms and had crushed out the flames with her own hands. The child's life was spared, the child was not even hurt, but Annie was in the hospital for a week. At the end of a week she returned to the school-room and play-room as the heroine of the hour. Mrs. Willis herself kissed her brow, and presented her in the midst of the approving smiles of her companions with the prettiest drawing-room of the sets. Annie retained her honorable post for one month.  Never did the girls of Lavender House forget the delights of that month. The fantastic arrangements of the little drawing room filled them with ecstacies. Annie was truly Japanese in her style--she was also intensely liberal in all her arrangements. In the tiny space of this little enclosure wild pranks were perpetrated, ceaseless jokes made up. From Annie's drawing-room issued peals of exquisite mirth. She gave afternoon tea from a Japanese set of tea-things. Outside her drawing-room always collected a crowd of girls, who tried to peep over the rail or to draw aside the curtains. Inside the sacred spot certainly reigned chaos, and one day Miss Danesbury had to fly to the rescue, for in a fit of mad mirth Annie herself had knocked down the little Japanese tea-table, the tea-pot and tea-things were in fragments on the floor, and the tea and milk poured in streams outside the curtains. Mrs. Willis sent for Annie that evening, and Miss Forest retired from her interview with red eyes and a meek expression.  \"Girls,\" she said, in confidence that night, \"good-bye to Japan. I gave her leave to do it--the care of an empire is more than I can manage.\"  The next day the Japanese drawing-room had been handed over to another possessor, and Annie reigned as queen over her empire no more.  Mrs. Willis, anxious at all times that her girls should be happy, made special arrangements for their benefit on Sunday. Sunday was by no means dull at Lavender House--Sunday was totally unlike the six days which followed it. Even the stupidest girl could scarcely complain of the severity of Sunday lessons--even the merriest girl could scarcely speak of the day as dull. Mrs. Willis made an invariable rule of spending all Sunday with her pupils. On this day she really unbent--on this day she was all during the long hours what she was during the short half-hour on each evening in the week. On Sunday she neither reproved nor corrected. If punishment or correction were necessary, she deputed Miss Good or Miss Danesbury to take her place. On Sunday she sat with the little children round her knee, and the older girls clustering about her. Her gracious and motherly face was like a sun shining in the midst of these young girls. In short, she was like the personified form of Goodness in their midst. It was necessary, therefore, that all those who wished to do right should be happy on Sunday, and only those few who deliberately preferred evil should shrink from the brightness of this day.  It is astonishing how much a sympathizing and guiding spirit can effect. The girls at Lavender House thought Sunday the shortest day in the week. There were no unoccupied or dull moments--school toil was forgotten--school punishment ceased, to be resumed again if necessary on Monday morning. The girls in their best dresses could chatter freely in English--they could read their favorite books--they could wander about the house as they pleased; for on Sunday the two baize doors were always wide open, and Mrs. Willis' own private suite of rooms was ready to receive them. If the day was fine they walked to church, each choosing her own companion for the pleasant walk; if the day was wet there was service in the chapel, Mr. Everard always conducting either morning or evening prayers. In the afternoon the girls were allowed to do pretty much as they pleased, but after tea there always came a delightful hour, when the elder girls retired with their mistress into her own special boudoir, and she either told them stories or sang to them as only she could sing. At sixty years of age Mrs. Willis still possessed the most sympathetic and touching voice those girls had ever listened to. Hester Thornton broke down completely on her first Sunday at Lavender House when she heard her school-mistress sing \"The Better Land.\" No one remarked on her tears, but two people saw them; for her mistress kissed her tenderly that night, and said a few strong words of help and encouragement, and Annie Forest, who made no comment, had also seen them, and wondered vaguely if this new and disagreeable pupil had a heart after all.  On Sunday night Mrs. Willis herself went round to each little bed and gave a mother-kiss to each of her pupils--a mother-kiss and a murmured blessing; and in many breasts resolves were then formed which were to help the girls through the coming week. Some of these resolves, made not in their own strength, bore fruit in long after-years. There is no doubt that very few girls who lived long enough at Lavender House, ever in after-days found their Sundays dull.     CHAPTER X.  VARIETIES.   Without any doubt, wild, naughty, impulsive Annie Forest was the most popular girl in the school. She was always in scrapes--she was scarcely ever out of hot water--her promises of amendment were truly like the proverbial pie-crust; but she was so lovable, so kind-hearted, so saucy and piquante and pretty, that very few could resist the nameless charm which she possessed. The little ones adored Annie, who was kindness itself to them; the bigger girls could not help admiring her fearlessness and courage; the best and noblest girls in the school tried to influence her for good. She was more or less an object of interest to every one; her courage was of just the sort to captivate schoolgirls, and her moral weakness was not observed by these inexperienced young eyes.  Hester alone, of all the girls who for a long time had come to Lavender House, failed to see any charm in Annie. She began by considering her ill-bred, and when she found she was the school favorite, she tossed her proud little head and determined that she for one would never be subjugated by such a naughty girl. Hester could read character with tolerable clearness; she was an observant child--very observant, and very thoughtful for her twelve years; and as the little witch Annie had failed to throw any spell over her, she saw her faults far more clearly than did her companions. There is no doubt that this brilliant, charming, and naughty Annie had heaps of faults; she had no perseverance; she was all passion and impulse; she could be the kindest of the kind, but from sheer thoughtlessness and wildness she often inflicted severe pain, even on those she loved best. Annie very nearly worshiped Mrs. Willis; she had the most intense adoration for her, she respected her beyond any other human being. There were moments when the impulsive and hot-headed child felt that she could gladly lay down her life for her school-mistress. Once the mistress was ill, and Annie curled herself up all night outside her door, thereby breaking rules, and giving herself a severe cold; but her passion and agony were so great that she could only be soothed by at last stealing into the darkened room and kissing the face she loved.  \"Prove your love to me, Annie, by going downstairs and keeping the school rules as perfectly as possible,\" whispered the teacher.  \"I will--I will never break a rule again as long as I live, if you get better, Mrs. Willis,\" responded the child.  She ran downstairs with her resolves strong within her, and yet in half an hour she was reprimanded for willful and desperate disobedience.  One day Cecil Temple had invited a select number of friends to afternoon tea in her little drawing-room. It was the Wednesday half-holiday, and Cecil's tea, poured into the tiniest cups and accompanied by thin wafer biscuits, was of the most _recherch_ quality. Cecil had invited Hester Thornton, and a tall girl who belonged to the first class and whose name was Dora Russell, to partake of this dainty beverage. They were sitting round the tiny tea-table, on little red stools with groups of flowers artistically painted on them, and were all three conducting themselves in a most ladylike and refined manner, when Annie Forest's curly head and saucy face popped over the enclosure, and her voice said eagerly:  \"Oh, may I be permitted to enter the shrine?\"  \"Certainly, Annie,\" said Cecil, in her most cordial tones. \"I have got another cup and saucer, and there is a little tea left in the tea-pot.\"  Annie came in, and ensconced herself cozily on the floor. It did not matter in the least to her that Hester Thornton's brow grew dark, and that Miss Russell suddenly froze into complete indifference to all her surroundings. Annie was full of a subject which excited her very much: she had suddenly discovered that she wanted to give Mrs. Willis a present, and she wished to know if any of the girls would like to join her.  \"I will give her the present this day week,\" said excitable Annie. \"I have quite made up my mind. Will any one join me?\"  \"But there is nothing special about this day week, Annie,\" said Miss Temple. \"It will neither be Mrs. Willis' birthday, nor Christmas Day, nor New Year's Day, nor Easter Day. Next Wednesday will be just like any other Wednesday. Why should we make Mrs. Willis a present?\"  \"Oh, because she looks as if she wanted one, poor dear. I thought she looked sad this morning; her eyes drooped and her mouth was down at the corners. I am sure she's wanting something from us all by now, just to show that we love her, you know.\"  \"Pshaw!\" here burst from Hester's lips.  \"Why do you say that?\" said Annie, turning round with her bright eyes flashing. \"You've no right to be so contemptuous when I speak about our--our head-mistress. Oh, Cecil,\" she continued, \"do let us give her a little surprise--some spring flowers, or something just to show her that we love her.\"  \"But _you_ don't love her,\" said Hester, stoutly.  Here was throwing down the gauntlet with a vengeance! Annie sprang to her feet and confronted Hester with a whole torrent of angry words. Hester firmly maintained her position. She said over and over again that love proved itself by deeds, not by words; that if Annie learned her lessons, and obeyed the school rules, she would prove her affection for Mrs. Willis far more than by empty protestations. Hester's words were true, but they were uttered in an unkind spirit, and the very flavor of truth which they possessed caused them to enter Annie's heart and to wound her deeply. She turned, not red, but very white, and her large and lovely eyes grew misty with unshed tears.  \"You are cruel,\" she gasped, rather than spoke, and then she pushed aside the curtains of Cecil's compartment and walked out of the play-room.  There was a dead silence among the three girls when she left them. Hester's heart was still hot, and she was still inclined to maintain her own position, and to believe she had done right in speaking in so severe a tone to Annie. But even she had been made a little uneasy by the look of deep suffering which had suddenly transformed Annie's charming childish face into that of a troubled and pained woman. She sat down meekly on her little three-legged stool and, taking up her tiny cup and saucer, sipped some of the cold tea.  Cecil Temple was the first to speak.  \"How could you?\" she said, in an indignant voice for her. \"Annie is not the girl to be driven, and in any case, it is not for you to correct her. Oh, Mrs. Willis would have been so pained had she heard you--you were not _kind_, Miss Thornton. There, I don't wish to be rude, but I fear I must leave you and Miss Russell--I must try and find Annie.\"  \"I'm going back to my own drawing-room,\" said Miss Russell, rising to her feet. \"Perhaps,\" she added, turning round with a very gracious smile to Hester, \"you will come and see me there, after tea, this evening.\"  Miss Russell drew aside the curtains of Cecil Temple's little room, and disappeared. Hester, with her eyes full of tears, now turned eagerly to Cecil.  \"Forgive me, Cecil,\" she exclaimed. \"I did not mean to be unkind, but it is really quite ridiculous the way you all spoil that girl--you know as well as I do that she is a very naughty girl. I suppose it is because of her pretty face,\" continued Hester, \"that you are all so unjust, and so blind to her faults.\"  \"You are prejudiced the other way, Hester,\" said Cecil in a more gentle tone. \"You have disliked Annie from the first. There, don't keep me--I must go to her now. There is no knowing what harm your words may have done. Annie is not like other girls. If you knew her story, you would, perhaps be kinder to her.\"  Cecil then ran out of her drawing-room, leaving Hester in sole possession of the little tea-things and the three-legged stools. She sat and thought for some time; she was a girl with a great deal of obstinacy in her nature, and she was not disposed to yield her own point, even to Cecil Temple; but Cecil's words had, nevertheless, made some impression on her.  At tea-time that night, Annie and Cecil entered the room together. Annie's eyes were as bright as stars, and her usually pale cheeks glowed with a deep color. She had never looked prettier--she had never looked so defiant, so mischievous, so utterly reckless. Mdlle. Perier fired indignant French at her across the table. Annie answered respectfully, and became demure in a moment; but even in the short instant in which the governess was obliged to lower her eyes to her plate, she had thrown a look so irresistibly comic at her companions that several of them had tittered aloud. Not once did she glance at Hester, although she occasionally looked boldly in her direction; but when she did so, her versatile face assumed a blank expression, as if she were seeing nothing. When tea was over, Dora Russell surprised the members of her own class by walking straight up to Hester, putting her hand inside her arm, and leading her off to her own very refined-looking little drawing-room.  \"I want to tell you,\" she said, when the two girls found themselves inside the small enclosure, \"that I quite agree with you in your opinion of Miss Forest. I think you were very brave to speak to her as you did to-day. As a rule, I never trouble myself with what the little girls in the third class do, and of course Annie seldom comes under my notice; but I think she is a decidedly spoiled child, and your rebuff will doubtless do her a great deal of good.\"  These words of commendation, coming from tall and dignified Miss Russell completely turned poor Hester's head.  \"Oh, I am so glad you think so!\" she stammered, coloring high with pleasure. \"You see,\" she added, assuming a little tone of extra refinement, \"at home I always associated with girls who were perfect ladies.\"  \"Yes, any one can see that,\" remarked Miss Russell approvingly.  \"And I do think Annie under-bred,\" continued Hester. \"I cannot understand,\" she added, \"why Miss Temple likes her so much.\"  \"Oh, Cecil is so amiable; she sees good in every one,\" answered Miss Russell. \"Annie is evidently not a lady, and I am glad at last to find some one of the girls who belong to the middle school capable of discerning this fact. Of course, we of the first class have nothing whatever to say to Miss Forest, but I really think Mrs. Willis is not acting quite fairly by the other girls when she allows a young person of that description into the school. I wish to assure you, Miss Thornton, that you have at least my sympathy, and I shall be very pleased to see you in my drawing-room now and then.\"  As these last words were uttered, both girls were conscious of a little rustling sound not far away. Miss Russell drew back her curtain, and asked very sharply, \"Who is there?\" but no one replied, nor was there any one in sight, for the girls who did not possess compartments were congregated at the other end of the long play-room, listening to stories which Emma Marshall, a clever elder girl, was relating for their benefit.  Miss Russell talked on indifferent subjects to Hester, and at the end of the half-hour the two entered the class-room side by side, Hester's little head a good deal turned by this notice from one of the oldest girls in the school.  As the two walked together into the school-room, Susan Drummond, who, tall as she was, was only in the fourth class, rushed up to Miss Forest, and whispered something in her ear.  \"It is just as I told you,\" she said, and her sleepy voice was quite wide awake and animated. Annie Forest rewarded her by a playful pinch on her cheek; then she returned to her own class, with a severe reprimand from the class teacher, and silence reigned in the long room, as the girls began to prepare their lessons as usual for the next day.  Miss Russell took her place at her desk in her usual dignified manner. She was a clever girl, and was going to leave school at the end of next term. Hers was a particularly fastidious, but by no means great nature. She was the child of wealthy parents; she was also well-born, and because of her money, and a certain dignity and style which had come to her as nature's gifts, she held an influence, though by no means a large one, in the school. No one particularly disliked her, but no one, again, ardently loved her. The girls in her own class thought it well to be friendly with Dora Russell, and Dora accepted their homage with more or less indifference. She did not greatly care for either their praise or blame. Dora possessed in a strong degree that baneful quality, which more than anything else precludes the love of others--she was essentially selfish.  She sat now before her desk, little guessing how she had caused Hester's small heart to beat by her patronage, and little suspecting the mischief she had done to the girl by her injudicious words. Had she known, it is to be doubted whether she would have greatly cared. She looked through the books which contained her tasks for the next day's work, and, finding they did not require a great deal of preparation, put them aside, and amused herself during the rest of preparation time with a storybook, which she artfully concealed behind the leaves of some exercises. She knew she was breaking the rules, but this fact did not trouble her, for her moral nature was, after all, no better than poor Annie's, and she had not a tenth of her lovable qualities.  Dora Russell was the soul of neatness and order. To look inside her school desk was a positive pleasure; to glance at her own neat and trim figure was more or less of a delight. Hers were the whitest hands in the school, and hers the most perfectly kept and glossy hair. As the preparation hour drew to a close, she replaced her exercises and books in exquisite order in her school desk and shut down the lid.  Hester's eyes followed her as she walked out of the school-room, for the head class never had supper with the younger girls. Hester wondered if she would glance in her direction; but Miss Russell had gratified a very passing whim when she condescended to notice and praise Hester, and she had already almost forgotten her existence.  At bed-time that night Susan Drummond's behavior was at the least extraordinary. In the first place, instead of being almost overpoweringly friendly with Hester, she scarcely noticed her; in the next place, she made some very peculiar preparations.  \"What _are_ you doing on the floor, Susan?\" inquired Hetty in an innocent tone.  \"That's nothing to you,\" replied Miss Drummond, turning a dusky red, and looking annoyed at being discovered. \"I do wish,\" she added, \"that you would go round to your side of the room and leave me alone; I sha'n't have done what I want to do before Danesbury comes in to put out the candle.\"  Hester was not going to put herself out with any of Susan Drummond's vagaries; she looked upon sleepy Susan as a girl quite beneath her notice, but even she could not help observing her, when she saw her sit up in bed a quarter of an hour after the candles had been put out, and in the flickering firelight which shone conveniently bright for her purpose, fasten a piece of string first round one of her toes, and then to the end of the bed-post.  \"What _are_ you doing?\" said Hester again, half laughing.  \"Oh, what a spy you are!\" said Susan. \"I want to wake, that's all; and whenever I turn in bed, that string will tug at my toe, and, of course, I'll rouse up. If you were more good-natured, I'd give the other end of the string to you; but, of course, that plan would never answer.\"  \"No, indeed,\" replied Hester; \"I am not going to trouble myself to wake you. You must trust to your sponge of cold water in the morning, unless your own admirable device succeeds.\"  \"I'm going to sleep now, at any rate,\" answered Susan; \"I'm on my back, and I'm beginning to snore; good night.\"  Once or twice during the night Hester heard groans from the self-sacrificing Susan, who, doubtless, found the string attached to her foot very inconvenient.  Hester, however, slept on when it might have been better for the peace of many in the school that she should have awakened. She heard no sound when, long before day, sleepy Susan stepped softly out of bed, and wrapping a thick shawl about her, glided out of the room. She was away for over half an hour, but she returned to her chamber and got into bed without in the least disturbing Hester. In the morning she was found so soundly asleep that even the sponge of cold water could not arouse her.  \"Pull the string at the foot of the bed, Alice,\" said Hester; \"she fastened a string to her toe, and twisted the other end round the bed-post, last night; pull it, Alice, it may effect its purpose.\"  But there was no string now round Susan Drummond's foot, nor was it found hanging to the bed-post.     CHAPTER XI.  WHAT WAS FOUND IN THE SCHOOL-DESK.   The next morning, when the whole school were assembled, and all the classes were getting ready for the real work of the day, Miss Good, the English teacher, stepped to the head of the room, and, holding a neatly bound volume of \"Jane Eyre\" in her hand, begged to know to whom it belonged. There was a hush of astonishment when she held up the little book, for all the girls knew well that this special volume was not allowed for school literature.  \"The housemaid who dusts the school-room found this book on the floor,\" continued the teacher. \"It lay beside a desk near the top of the room. I see the name has been torn out, so I cannot tell who is the owner. I must request her, however, to step forward and take possession of her property. If there is the slightest attempt at concealment, the whole matter will be laid before Mrs. Willis at noon to-day.\"  When Miss Good had finished her little speech, she held up the book in its green binding and looked down the room.  Hester did not know why her heart beat--no one glanced at her, no one regarded her; all eyes were fixed on Miss Good, who stood with a severe, unsmiling, but expectant face.  \"Come, young ladies,\" she said, \"the owner has surely no difficulty in recognizing her own property. I give you exactly thirty seconds more; then if no one claims the book, I place the affair in Mrs. Willis' hands.\"  Just then there was a stir among the girls in the head class. A tall girl in dove-colored cashmere, with a smooth head of golden hair, and a fair face which was a good deal flushed at this moment, stepped to the front, and said in a clear and perfectly modulated voice:  \"I had no idea of concealing the fact that 'Jane Eyre' belongs to me. I was only puzzled for a moment to know how it got on the floor. I placed it carefully in my desk last night. I think this circumstance ought to be inquired into.\"  \"Oh! Oh!\" came from several suppressed voices here and there through the room; \"whoever would have supposed that Dora Russell would be obliged to humble herself in this way?\"  \"Attention, young ladies!\" said Miss Good; \"no talking, if you please. Do I understand, Miss Russell, that 'Jane Eyre' is yours?\"  \"Yes, Miss Good.\"  \"Why did you keep it in your desk--were you reading it during preparation?\"  \"Oh, yes, certainly.\"  \"You are, of course, aware that you were breaking two very stringent rules of the school. In the first place, no story-books are allowed to be concealed in a school-desk, or to be read during preparation. In the second place, this special book is not allowed to be read at any time in Lavender House. You know these rules, Miss Russell?\"  \"Yes, Miss Good.\"  \"I must retain the book--you can return now to your place in class.\"  Miss Russell bowed sedately, and with an apparently unmoved face, except for the slightly deepened glow on her smooth cheek, resumed her interrupted work.  Lessons went on as usual, but during recreation the mystery of the discovered book was largely discussed by the girls. As is the custom of schoolgirls, they took violent sides in the matter--some rejoicing in Dora's downfall, some pitying her intensely. Hester was, of course, one of Miss Russell's champions, and she looked at her with tender sympathy when she came with her haughty and graceful manner into the school-room, and her little heart beat with vague hope that Dora might turn to her for sympathy.  Dora, however, did nothing of the kind. She refused to discuss the affair with her companions, and none of them quite knew what Mrs. Willis said to her, or what special punishment was inflicted on the proud girl. Several of her schoolfellows expected that Dora's drawing-room would be taken away from her, but she still retained it; and after a few days the affair of the book was almost forgotten.  There was, however, an uncomfortable and an uneasy spirit abroad in the school. Susan Drummond, who was certainly one of the most uninteresting girls in Lavender House, was often seen walking with and talking to Miss Forest. Sometimes Annie shook her pretty head over Susan's remarks; sometimes she listened to her; sometimes she laughed and spoke eagerly for a moment or two, and appeared to acquiesce in suggestions which her companion urged.  Annie had always been the soul of disorder--of wild pranks, of naughty and disobedient deeds--but, hitherto, in all her wildness she had never intentionally hurt any one but herself. Hers was a giddy and thoughtless, but by no means a bitter tongue--she thought well of all her schoolfellows--and on occasions she could be self-sacrificing and good-natured to a remarkable extent. The girls of the head class took very little notice of Annie, but her other school companions, as a rule, succumbed to her sunny, bright, and witty ways. She offended them a hundred times a day, and a hundred times a day was forgiven. Hester was the first girl in the third class who had ever persistently disliked Annie, and Annie, after making one or two overtures of friendship, began to return Miss Thornton's aversion; but she had never cordially hated her until the day they met in Cecil Temple's drawing-room, and Hester had wounded Annie in her tenderest part by doubting her affection for Mrs. Willis.  Since that day there was a change very noticeable in Annie Forest--she was not so gay as formerly, but she was a great deal more mischievous--she was not nearly so daring, but she was capable now of little actions, slight in themselves, which yet were calculated to cause mischief and real unhappiness. Her sudden friendship with Susan Drummond did her no good, and she persistently avoided all intercourse with Cecil Temple, who hitherto had influenced her in the right direction.  The incident of the green book had passed with no apparent result of grave importance, but the spirit of mischief which had caused this book to be found was by no means asleep in the school. Pranks were played in a most mysterious fashion with the girls' properties.  Hester herself was the very next victim. She, too, was a neat and orderly child--she was clever and thoroughly enjoyed her school work. She was annoyed, therefore, and dreadfully puzzled, by discovering one morning that her neat French exercise book was disgracefully blotted, and one page torn across. She was severely reprimanded by Mdlle. Perier for such gross untidiness and carelessness, and when she assured the governess that she knew nothing whatever of the circumstance, that she was never guilty of blots, and had left the book in perfect order the night before, the French lady only shrugged her shoulders, made an expressive gesture with her eyebrows, and plainly showed Hester that she thought the less she said on that subject the better.  Hester was required to write out her exercise again, and she fancied she saw a triumphant look in Annie Forest's eyes as she left the school-room, where poor Hester was obliged to remain to undergo her unmerited punishment.  \"Cecil,\" called Hester, in a passionate and eager voice, as Miss Temple was passing her place.  Cecil paused for a moment.  \"What is it, Hetty?--oh, I am so sorry you must stay in this lovely bright day.\"  \"I have done nothing wrong,\" said Hester; \"I never blotted this exercise-book; I never tore this page. It is most unjust not to believe my word; it is most unjust to punish me for what I have not done.\"  Miss Temple's face looked puzzled and sad.  \"I must not stay to talk to you now, Hester,\" she whispered; \"I am breaking the rules. You can come to my drawing-room by-and-by, and we will discuss this matter.\"  But Hester and Cecil, talk as they would, could find no solution to the mystery. Cecil absolutely refused to believe that Annie Forest had anything to do with the matter.  \"No,\" she said, \"such deceit is not in Annie's nature. I would do anything to help you, Hester; but I can't, and I won't, believe that Annie tried deliberately to do you any harm.\"  \"I am quite certain she did,\" retorted Hester, \"and from this moment I refuse to speak to her until she confesses what she has done and apologizes to me. Indeed, I have a great mind to go and tell everything to Mrs. Willis.\"  \"Oh, I would not do that,\" said Cecil; \"none of your schoolfellows would forgive you if you charged such a favorite as Annie with a crime which you cannot in the least prove against her. You must be patient, Hester, and if you are, I will take your part, and try to get at the bottom of the mystery.\"  Cecil, however, failed to do so. Annie laughed when the affair was discussed in her presence, but her clear eyes looked as innocent as the day, and nothing would induce Cecil to doubt Miss Forest's honor.  The mischievous sprite, however, who was sowing such seeds of unhappiness in the hitherto peaceful school was not satisfied with two deeds of daring; for a week afterward Cecil Temple found a book of Mrs. Browning's, out of which she was learning a piece for recitation, with its cover half torn off, and, still worse, a caricature of Mrs. Willis sketched with some cleverness and a great deal of malice on the title-page. On the very same morning, Dora Russell, on opening her desk, was seen to throw up her hands with a gesture of dismay. The neat composition she had finished the night before was not to be seen in its accustomed place, but in a corner of the desk were two bulky and mysterious parcels, one of which contained a great junk of rich plum-cake, and the other some very sticky and messy \"Turkish delight;\" while the paper which enveloped these luxuries was found to be that on which the missing composition was written. Dora's face grew very white, she forgot the ordinary rules of the school, and, leaving her class, walked down the room, and interrupted Miss Good, who was beginning to instruct the third class in English grammar.  \"Will you please come and see something in my desk, Miss Good?\" she said in a voice which trembled with excitement.  It was while she was speaking that Cecil found the copy of Mrs. Browning mutilated, and with the disgraceful caricature on its title-page. Startled as she was by this discovery, and also by Miss Russell's extraordinary behavior, she had presence of mind enough to hide the sight which pained her from her companions. Unobserved, in the strong interest of the moment, for all the girls were watching Dora Russell and Miss Good, she managed to squeeze the little volume into her pocket. She had indeed received a great shock, for she knew well that the only girl who could caricature in the school was Annie Forest. For a moment her troubled eyes sought the ground, but then she raised them and looked at Annie; Annie, however, with a particularly cheerful face, and her bright dark eyes full of merriment, was gazing in astonishment at the scene which was taking place in front of Miss Russell's desk.  Dora, whose enunciation was very clear, seemed to have absolutely forgotten herself; she disregarded Miss Good's admonitions, and declared stoutly that at such a moment she did not care what rules she broke. She was quite determined that the culprit who had dared to desecrate her composition, and put plum-cake and \"Turkish delight\" into her desk, should be publicly exposed and punished.  \"The thing cannot go on any longer, Miss Good,\" she said; \"there is a girl in this school who ought to be expelled from it, and I for one declare openly that I will not submit to associate with a girl who is worse than unladylike. If you will permit me, Miss Good, I will carry these things at once to Mrs. Willis, and beg of her to investigate the whole affair, and bring the culprit to justice, and to turn her out of the school.\"  \"Stay, Miss Russell,\" exclaimed the English teacher, \"you strangely and completely forget yourself. You are provoked, I own, but you have no right to stand up and absolutely hoist the flag of rebellion in the faces of the other girls. I cannot excuse your conduct. I will myself take away these parcels which were found in your desk, and will report the affair to Mrs. Willis. She will take what steps she thinks right in bringing you to order, and in discovering the author of this mischief. Return instantly to your desk, Miss Russell; you strangely forget yourself.\"  Miss Good left the room, having removed the plum-cake and \"Turkish delight\" from Dora Russell's desk, and lessons continued as best they could under such exciting circumstances.  At twelve o'clock that day, just as the girls were preparing to go up to their rooms to get ready for their usual walk, Mrs. Willis came into the school-room.  \"Stay one moment, young ladies,\" said the head-mistress in that slightly vibrating and authoritative voice of hers. \"I have a word or two to say to you all. Miss Good has just brought me a painful story of wanton and cruel mischief. There are fifty girls in this school, who, until lately, lived happily together. There is now one girl among the fifty whose object it is to sow seeds of discord and misery among her companions. Miss Good has told me of three different occasions on which mischief has been done to different girls in the school. Twice Miss Russell's desk has been disturbed, once Miss Thornton's. It is possible that other girls may also have suffered who have been noble enough not to complain. There is, however, a grave mischief, in short a moral disease in our midst. Such a thing is worse than bodily illness--it must be stamped out instantly and completely at the risk of any personal suffering. I am now going to ask you, girls, a simple question, and I demand instant truth without any reservation. Miss Russell's desk has been tampered with--Miss Thornton's desk has been tampered with. Has any other girl suffered injury--has any other girl's desk been touched?\"  Mrs. Willis looked down the long room--her voice had reached every corner, and the quiet, dignified, and deeply-pained expression in her fine eyes was plainly visible to each girl in the school. Even the little ones were startled and subdued by the tone of Mrs. Willis' voice, and one or two of them suddenly burst into tears. Mrs. Willis paused for a full moment, then she repeated her question.  \"I insist upon knowing the exact truth, my dear children,\" she said gently, but with great decision.  \"My desk has also been tampered with,\" said Miss Temple, in a low voice.  Every one started when Cecil spoke, and even Annie Forest glanced at her with a half-frightened and curious expression. Cecil's voice indeed was so low, so shaken with doubt and pain, that her companions scarcely recognized it.  \"Come here, Miss Temple,\" said Mrs. Willis.  Cecil instantly left her desk and walked up the room.  \"Your desk has also been tampered with, you say?\" repeated the head-mistress.  \"Yes, madam.\"  \"When did you discover this?\"  \"To-day, Mrs. Willis.\"  \"You kept it to yourself?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Will you now repeat in the presence of the school, and in a loud enough voice to be heard by all here, exactly what was done?\"  \"Pardon me,\" answered Cecil, and now her voice was a little less agitated and broken, and she looked full into the face of her teacher, \"I cannot do that.\"  \"You deliberately disobey me, Cecil?\" said Mrs. Willis.  \"Yes, madam.\"  Mrs. Willis' face flushed--she did not, however, look angry; she laid her hand on Cecil's shoulder and looked full into her eyes.  \"You are one of my best pupils, Cecil,\" she said tenderly. \"At such a moment as this, honor requires you to stand by your mistress. I must insist on your telling me here and now exactly what has occurred.\"  Cecil's face grew whiter and whiter.  \"I cannot tell you,\" she murmured; \"it breaks my heart, but I cannot tell you.\"  \"You have defied me, Cecil,\" said Mrs. Willis in a tone of deep pain. \"I must, my dear, insist on your obedience, but not now. Miss Good, will you take Miss Temple to the chapel? I will come to you, Cecil, in an hour's time.\"  Cecil walked down the room crying silently. Her deep distress and her very firm refusal to disclose what she knew had made a great impression on her schoolfellows. They all felt troubled and uneasy, and Annie Forest's face was very pale.  \"This thing, this wicked, mischievous thing has gone deeper than I feared,\" said Mrs. Willis, when Cecil had left the room. \"Only some very strong motive would make Cecil Temple behave as she is now doing. She is influenced by a mistaken idea of what is right; she wishes to shield the guilty person. I may as well tell you all, young ladies, that, dear as Cecil is to me, she is now under the ban of my severe displeasure. Until she confesses the truth and humbles herself before me, I cannot be reconciled to her. I cannot permit her to associate with you. She has done very wrong, and her punishment must be proportionately severe. There is one chance for her, however. Will the girl whom she is mistakenly, though generously, trying to shield, come forward and confess her guilt, and so release poor Cecil from the terrible position in which she has placed herself? By doing so, the girl who has caused all this misery will at least show me that she is trying to repent?\"  Mrs. Willis paused again, and now she looked down the room with a face of almost entreaty. Several pairs of eyes were fixed anxiously on her, several looked away, and many girls glanced in the direction of Annie Forest, who, feeling herself suspected, returned their glances with bold defiance, and instantly assumed her most reckless manner.  Mrs. Willis waited for a full minute.  \"The culprit is not noble enough,\" she said then. \"Now, girls, I must ask each of you to come up one by one and deny or confess this charge. As you do so, you are silently to leave the school-room and go up to your rooms, and prepare for the walk which has been so painfully delayed. Miss Conway, you are at the head of the school, will you set the example?\"  One by one the girls of the head class stepped up to their teacher, and of each one she asked the same question:  \"Are you guilty?\"  Each girl replied in the negative and walked out of the school-room. The second class followed the example of the first, and then the third class came up to their teacher. Several ears were strained to hear Annie Forest's answer, but her eyes were lifted fearlessly to Mrs. Willis' face, and her \"No!\" was heard all over the room.     CHAPTER XII.  IN THE CHAPEL.   The bright light from a full noontide sun was shining in colored bars through the richly-painted windows of the little chapel when Mrs. Willis sought Cecil Temple there.  Cecil's face was in many ways a remarkable one.  Her soft brown eyes were generally filled with a steadfast and kindly ray. Gentleness was her special prerogative, but there was nothing weak about her--hers was the gentleness of a strong, and pure, and noble soul. To know Cecil was to love her. She was a motherless girl, and the only child of a most indulgent father. Colonel Temple was now in India, and Cecil was to finish her education under Mrs. Willis' care, and then, if necessary, to join her father.  Mrs. Willis had always taken a special interest in this girl. She admired her for her great moral worth. Cecil was not particularly clever, but she was so studious, so painstaking, that she always kept a high place in class. She was without doubt a religious girl, but there was nothing of the prig about her. She was not, however, ashamed of her religion, and, if the fitting occasion arose, she was fearless in expressing her opinion.  Mrs. Willis used to call Cecil her \"little standard-bearer,\" and she relied greatly on her influence over the third-class girls. Mrs. Willis considered the third class, perhaps, the most important in the school. She was often heard to say:  \"The girls who fill this class have come to a turning point--they have come to the age when resolves may be made for life, and kept. The good third-class girl is very unlikely to degenerate as she passes through the second and first classes. On the other hand, there is very little hope that the idle or mischievous third-class girl will mend her ways as she goes higher in the school.\"  Mrs. Willis' steps were very slow, and her thoughts extremely painful, as she entered the chapel to-day. Had any one else offered her defiance she would have known how to deal with the culprit, but Cecil would never have acted as she did without the strongest motive, and Mrs. Willis felt more sorrowful than angry as she sat down by the side of her favorite pupil.  \"I have kept you waiting longer than I intended, my dear,\" she said. \"I was unexpectedly interrupted, and I am sorry; but you have had more time to think, Cecil.\"  \"Yes, I have thought,\" answered Cecil, in a very low tone.  \"And, perhaps,\" continued her governess, \"in this quiet and beautiful and sacred place, my dear pupil has also prayed?\"  \"I have prayed,\" said Cecil.  \"Then you have been guided, Cecil,\" said Mrs. Willis, in a tone of relief. \"We do not come to God in our distress without being shown the right way. Your doubts have been removed, Cecil; you can now speak fully to me: can you not, dear?\"  \"I have asked God to tell me what is right,\" said Cecil. \"I don't pretend to know. I am very much puzzled. It seems to me that more good would be done if I concealed what you asked me to confess in the school-room. My own feeling is that I ought not to tell you. I know this is great disobedience, and I am quite willing to receive any punishment you think right to give me. Yes, I think I am quite willing to receive _any_ punishment.\"  Mrs. Willis put her hand on Cecil's shoulder.  \"Ordinary punishments are not likely to affect you, Cecil,\" she said; \"on you I have no idea of inflicting extra lessons, or depriving you of half-holidays, or even taking away your drawing-room. But there is something else you must lose, and that I know will touch you deeply--I must remove from you my confidence.\"  Cecil's face grew very pale.  \"And your love, too?\" she said, looking up with imploring eyes; \"oh, surely not your love as well?\"  \"I ask you frankly, Cecil,\" replied Mrs. Willis, \"can perfect love exist without perfect confidence? I would not willingly deprive you of my love, but of necessity the love I have hitherto felt for you must be altered--in short, the old love, which enabled me to rest on you and trust you, will cease.\"  Cecil covered her face with her hands.  \"This punishment is very cruel,\" she said. \"You are right; it reaches down to my very heart. But,\" she added, looking up with a strong and sweet light in her face, \"I will try and bear it, and some day you will understand.\"  \"Listen, Cecil,\" said Mrs. Willis; \"you have just told me you have prayed to God, and have asked Him to show you the right path. Now, my dear, suppose we kneel together, and both of us ask Him to show us the way out of this difficult matter. I want to be guided to use the right words with you, Cecil. You want to be guided to receive the instruction which I, as your teacher and mother-friend, would give you.\"  Cecil and Mrs. Willis both knelt down, and the head-mistress said a few words in a voice of great earnestness and entreaty; then they resumed their seats.  \"Now, Cecil,\" said Mrs. Willis, \"you must remember in listening to me that I am speaking to you as I believe God wishes me to. If I can convince you that you are doing wrong in concealing what you know from me, will you act as I wish in the matter?\"  \"I long to be convinced,\" said Cecil, in a low tone.  \"That is right, my dear; I can now speak to you with perfect freedom. My words you will remember, Cecil, are now, I firmly believe, directed by God; they are also the result of a large experience. I have trained many girls. I have watched the phases of thought in many young minds. Cecil, look at me. I can read you like a book.\"  Cecil looked up expectantly.  \"Your motive for this concealment is as clear as the daylight, Cecil. You are keeping back what you know because you want to shield some one. Am I not right, my dear?\"  The color flooded Cecil's pale face. She bent her head in silent assent, but her eyes were too full of tears, and her lips trembled too much to allow her to speak.  \"The girl you want to defend,\" continued Mrs. Willis, in that clear, patient voice of hers, \"is one whom you and I both love--is one for whom we both have prayed--is one for whom we would both gladly sacrifice ourselves if necessary. Her name is----\"  \"Oh, don't,\" said Cecil imploringly--\"don't say her name; you have no right to suspect her.\"  \"I must say her name, Cecil, dear. If you suspect Annie Forest, why should not I? You do suspect her, do you not, Cecil?\"  Cecil began to cry.  \"I know it,\" continued Mrs. Willis. \"Now, Cecil, we will suppose, terrible as this suspicion is, fearfully as it pains us both, that Annie Forest _is_ guilty. We must suppose for the sake of my argument that this is the case. Do you not know, my dear Cecil, that you are doing the falsest, cruelest thing by dear Annie in trying to hide her sin from me? Suppose, just for the sake of our argument, that this cowardly conduct on Annie's part was never found out by me; what effect would it have on Annie herself?\"  \"It would save her in the eyes of the school,\" said Cecil.  \"Just so; but God would know the truth. Her next downfall would be deeper. In short, Cecil, under the idea of friendship you would have done the cruelest thing in all the world for your friend.\"  Cecil was quite silent.  \"This is one way to look at it,\" continued Mrs. Willis; \"but there are many other points from which this case ought to be viewed. You owe much to Annie, but not all--you have a duty to perform to your other schoolfellows. You have a duty to perform to me. If you possess a clue which will enable me to convict Annie Forest of her sin, in common justice you have no right to withhold it. Remember, that while she goes about free and unsuspected, some other girl is under the ban--some other girl is watched and feared. You fail in your duty to your schoolfellows when you keep back your knowledge, Cecil. When you refuse to trust me, you fail in your duty to your mistress; for I cannot stamp out this evil and wicked thing from our midst unless I know all. When you conceal your knowledge, you ruin the character of the girl you seek to shield. When you conceal your knowledge, you go against God's express wish. There--I have spoken to you as He directed me to speak.\"  Cecil suddenly sprang to her feet.  \"I never thought of all these things,\" she said. \"You are right, but it is very hard, and mine is only a suspicion. Oh, do be tender to her, and--forgive me--may I go away now?\"  As she spoke, she pulled out the torn copy of Mrs. Browning, laid it on her teacher's lap, and ran swiftly out of the chapel.     CHAPTER XIII.  TALKING OVER THE MYSTERY.   Annie Forest, sitting in the midst of a group of eager admirers, was chatting volubly. Never had she been in higher spirits, never had her pretty face looked more bright and daring.  Cecil Temple coming into the play-room, started when she saw her. Annie, however, instantly rose from the low hassock on which she had perched herself and, running up to Cecil, put her hand through her arm.  \"We are all discussing the mystery, darling,\" she said; \"we have discussed it, and literally torn it to shreds, and yet never got at the kernel. We have guessed and guessed what your motive can be in concealing the truth from Mrs. Willis, and we all unanimously vote that you are a dear old martyr, and that you have some admirable reason for keeping back the truth. You cannot think what an excitement we are in--even Susy Drummond has stayed awake to listen to our chatter. Now, Cecil, do come and sit here in this most inviting little arm-chair, and tell us what our dear head-mistress said to you in the chapel. It did seem so awful to send you to the chapel, poor dear Cecil.\"  Cecil stood perfectly still and quiet while Annie was pouring out her torrent of eager words; her eyes, indeed, did not quite meet her companion's, but she allowed Annie to retain her clasp of her arm, and she evidently listened with attention to her words. Now, however, when Miss Forest tried to draw her into the midst of the eager and animated group who sat round the play-room fire, she hesitated and looked longingly in the direction of her peaceful little drawing-room. Her hesitation, however, was but momentary. Quite silently she walked with Annie down the large play-room and entered the group of girls.  \"Here's your throne, Queen Cecil,\" said Annie, trying to push her into the little arm-chair; but Cecil would not seat herself.  \"How nice that you have come, Cecil!\" said Mary Pierce, a second-class girl. \"I really think--we all think--that you were very brave to stand out against Mrs. Willis as you did. Of course we are devoured with curiosity to know what it means; arn't we, Flo?\"  \"Yes, we're in agonies,\" answered Flo Dunstan, another second-class girl.  \"You will tell exactly what Mrs. Willis said, darling heroine?\" proceeded Annie in her most dulcet tones. \"You concealed your knowledge, didn't you? you were very firm, weren't you? dear, brave love!\"  \"For my part, I think Cecil Temple the soul of brave firmness,\" here interrupted Susan Drummond. \"I fancy she's as hard and firm in herself when she wants to conceal a thing as that rocky sweetmeat which always hurts our teeth to get through. Yes, I do fancy that.\"  \"Oh, Susy, what a horrid metaphor!\" here interrupted several girls.  One, however, of the eager group of schoolgirls had not opened her lips or said a word; that girl was Hester Thornton. She had been drawn into the circle by an intense curiosity; but she had made no comment with regard to Cecil's conduct. If she knew anything of the mystery she had thrown no light on it. She had simply sat motionless, with watchful and alert eyes and silent tongue. Now, for the first time, she spoke.  \"I think, if you will allow her, that Cecil has got something to say,\" she remarked.  Cecil glanced down at her with a very brief look of gratitude.  \"Thank you, Hester,\" she said. \"I won't keep you a moment, girls. I cannot offer to throw any light on the mystery which makes us all so miserable to-day; but I think it right to undeceive you with regard to myself. I have not concealed what I know from Mrs. Willis. She is in possession of all the facts, and what I found in my desk this morning is now in her keeping. She has made me see that in concealing my knowledge I was acting wrongly, and whatever pain has come to me in the matter, she now knows all.\"  When Cecil had finished her sad little speech she walked straight out of the group of girls, and, without glancing at one of them, went across the play-room to her own compartment. She had failed to observe a quick and startled glance from Susan Drummond's sleepy blue eyes, nor had she heard her mutter--half to her companions, half to herself:  \"Cecil is not like the rocky sweetmeat; I was mistaken in her.\"  Neither had Cecil seen the flash of almost triumph in Hester's eyes, nor the defiant glance she threw at Miss Forest. Annie stood with her hands clasped, and a little frown of perplexity between her brows, for a moment; then she ran fearlessly down the play-room, and said in a low voice at the other side of Cecil's curtains:  \"May I come in?\"  Cecil said \"Yes,\" and Annie, entering the pretty little drawing-room, flung her arms round Miss Temple's neck.  \"Cecil,\" she exclaimed impulsively, \"you're in great trouble. I am a giddy, reckless thing, I know, but I don't laugh at people when they are in real trouble. Won't you tell me all about it, Cecil?\"  \"I will, Annie. Sit down there and I will tell you everything. I think you have a right to know, and I am glad you have come to me. I thought perhaps--but no matter. Annie, can't you guess what I am going to say?\"  \"No, I'm sure I can't,\" said Annie. \"I saw for a moment or two to-day that some of those absurd girls suspected me of being the author of all this mischief. Now, you know, Cecil, I love a bit of fun beyond words. If there's any going on I feel nearly mad until I am in it; but what was done to-day was not at all in accordance with my ideas of fun. To tear up Miss Russell's essay and fill her desk with stupid plum-cake and Turkish delight seems to me but a sorry kind of jest. Now, if I had been guilty of that sort of thing, I'd have managed something far cleverer than that. If _I_ had tampered with Dora Russell's desk, I'd have done the thing in style. The dear, sweet, dignified creature should have shrieked in real terror. You don't know, perhaps, Cecil, that our admirable Dora is no end of a coward. I wonder what she would have said if I had put a little nest of field-mice in her desk! I saw that the poor thing suspected me, as she gave way to her usual little sneer about the 'under-bred girl;' but, of course, _you_ know me, Cecil. Why, my dear Cecil, what is the matter? How white you are, and you are actually crying! What is it, Cecil? what is it, Cecil, darling?\"  Cecil dried her eyes quickly.  \"You know my pet copy of Mrs. Browning's poems, don't you, Annie?\"  \"Oh, yes, of course. You lent it to me one day. Don't you remember how you made me cry over that picture of little Alice, the over-worked factory girl? What about the book, Cecil?\"  \"I found the book in my desk,\" said Cecil, in a steady tone, and now fixing her eyes on Annie, who knelt by her side--\"I found the book in my desk, although I never keep it there; for it is quite against the rules to keep our recreation books in our school-desks, and you know, Annie, I always think it is so much easier to keep these little rules. They are matters of duty and conscience, after all. I found my copy of Mrs. Browning in my desk this morning with the cover torn off, and with a very painful and ludicrous caricature of our dear Mrs. Willis sketched on the title-page.\"  \"What?\" said Annie. \"No, no; impossible!\"  \"You know nothing about it, do you, Annie?\"  \"I never put it there, if that's what you mean,\" said Annie. But her face had undergone a curious change. Her light and easy and laughing manner had altered. When Cecil mentioned the caricature she flushed a vivid crimson. Her flush had quickly died away, leaving her olive-tinted face paler than its wont.  \"I see,\" she said, after a long pause, \"you, too, suspected me, Cecil, and that is why you tried to conceal the thing. You know that I am the only girl in the school who can draw caricatures, but did you suppose that I would show _her_ dishonor? Of course things look ugly for me, if this is what you found in your book; but I did not think that _you_ would suspect me, Cecil.\"  \"I will believe you, Annie,\" said Cecil, eagerly. \"I long beyond words to believe you. With all your faults, no one has ever yet found you out in a lie. If you look at me, Annie, and tell me honestly that you know nothing whatever about that caricature, I will believe you. Yes, I will believe you fully, and I will go with you to Mrs. Willis and tell her that, whoever did the wrong, you are innocent in this matter. Say you know nothing about it, dear, dear Annie, and take a load off my heart.\"  \"I never put the caricature into your book, Cecil.\"  \"And you know nothing about it?\"  \"I cannot say that; I never--never put it in your book.\"  \"Oh, Annie,\" exclaimed poor Cecil, \"you are trying to deceive me. Why won't you be brave? Oh, Annie, I never thought you would stoop to a lie.\"  \"I'm telling no lie,\" answered Annie with sudden passion. \"I do know something about the caricature, but I never put it into that book. There! you doubt me, you have ceased to believe me, and I won't waste any more words on the matter.\"     CHAPTER XIV.  \"SENT TO COVENTRY.\"   There were many girls in the school who remembered that dismal half-holiday--they remembered its forced mirth and its hidden anxiety; and as the hours flew by the suspicion that Annie Forest was the author of all the mischief grew and deepened. A school is like a little world, and popular opinion is apt to change with great rapidity. Annie was undoubtedly the favorite of the school; but favorites are certain to have enemies, and there were several girls unworthy enough and mean enough to be jealous of poor Annie's popularity. She was the kind of girl whom only very small natures could really dislike. Her popularity arose from the simple fact that hers was a peculiarly joyous and unselfish nature. She was a girl with scarcely any self-consciousness; those she loved, she loved devotedly; she threw herself with a certain feverish impetuosity into their lives, and made their interest her own. To get into mischief and trouble for the sake of a friend was an every-day occurrence with Annie. She was not the least studious; she had no one particular talent, unless it was an untrained and birdlike voice; she was always more or less in hot water about her lessons, always behindhand in her tasks, always leaving undone what she should do, and doing what she should not do. She was a contradictory, erratic creature--jealous of no one, envious of no one--dearly loving a joke, and many times inflicting pain from sheer thoughtlessness, but always ready to say she was sorry, always ready to make friends again.  It is strange that such a girl as Annie should have enemies, but she had, and in the last few weeks the feeling of jealousy and envy which had always been smoldering in some breasts took more active form. Two reasons accounted for this: Hester's openly avowed and persistent dislike to Annie, and Miss Russell's declared conviction that she was under-bred and not a lady.  Miss Russell was the only girl in the first class who had hitherto given wild little Annie a thought.  In the first class, to-day, Annie had to act the unpleasing part of the wicked little heroine. Miss Russell was quite certain of Annie's guilt; she and her companions condescended to discuss poor Annie and to pull all her little virtues to pieces, and to magnify her sins to an alarming extent.  After two or three hours of judicious conversation, Dora Russell and most of the other first-class girls decided that Annie ought to be expelled, and unanimously resolved that they, at least, would do what they could to \"send her to Coventry.\"  In the lower part of the school Annie also had a few enemies, and these girls, having carefully observed Hester's attitude toward her, now came up close to this dignified little lady, and asked her boldly to declare her opinion with regard to Annie's guilt.  Hester, without the least hesitation, assured them that \"of course Annie had done it.\"  \"There is not room for a single doubt on the subject,\" she said; \"there--look at her now.\"  At this instant Annie was leaving Cecil's compartment, and with red eyes, and hair, as usual, falling about her face, was running out of the play-room. She seemed in great distress; but, nevertheless, before she reached the door, she stopped to pick up a little girl of five, who was fretting about some small annoyance. Annie took the little one in her arms, kissed her tenderly, whispered some words in her ear, which caused the little face to light up with some smiles and the round arms to clasp Annie with an ecstatic hug. She dropped the child, who ran back to play merrily with her companions, and left the room.  The group of middle-class girls still sat on by the fire, but Hester Thornton now, not Annie, was the center of attraction. It was the first time in all her young life that Hester had found herself in the enviable position of a favorite; and without at all knowing what mischief she was doing, she could not resist improving the occasion, and making the most of her dislike for Annie.  Several of those who even were fond of Miss Forest came round to the conviction that she was really guilty, and one by one, as is the fashion not only among school girls but in the greater world outside, they began to pick holes in their former favorite. These girls, too, resolved that, if Annie were really so mean as maliciously to injure other girls' property and get them into trouble, she must be \"sent to Coventry.\"  \"What's Coventry?\" asked one of the little ones, the child whom Annie had kissed and comforted, now sidling up to the group.  \"Oh, a nasty place, Phena,\" said Mary Bell, putting her arm round the pretty child and drawing her to her side.  \"And who is going there?\"  \"Why, I am afraid it is naughty Annie Forest.\"  \"She's not naughty! Annie sha'n't go to any nasty place. I hate you, Mary Bell.\" The little one looked round the group with flashing eyes of defiance, then wrenched herself away to return to her younger companions.  \"It was stupid of you to say that, Mary,\" remarked one of the girls. \"Well,\" she continued, \"I suppose it is all settled, and poor Annie, to say the least of it, is not a lady. For my own part, I always thought her great fun, but if she is proved guilty of this offense I wash my hands of her.\"  \"We all wash our hands of her,\" echoed the girls, with the exception of Susan Drummond, who, as usual, was nodding in her chair.  \"What do you say, Susy?\" asked one or two; \"you have not opened your lips all this time.\"  \"I--eh?--what?\" asked Susan, stretching herself and yawning, \"oh, about Annie Forest--I suppose you are right, girls. Is not that the tea-gong? I'm awfully hungry.\"  Hester Thornton went into the tea-room that evening feeling particularly virtuous, and with an idea that she had distinguished herself in some way.  Poor foolish, thoughtless Hester, she little guessed what seed she had sown, and what a harvest she was preparing for her own reaping by-and-by.     CHAPTER XV.  ABOUT SOME PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT NO EVIL.   A few days after this Hester was much delighted to receive an invitation from her little friends, the Misses Bruce. These good ladies had not forgotten the lonely and miserable child whom they had comforted not a little during her journey to school six weeks ago. They invited Hester to spend the next half-holiday with them, and as this happened to fall on a Saturday, Mrs. Willis gave Hester permission to remain with her friends until eight o'clock, when she would send the carriage to fetch her home.  The trouble about Annie had taken place the Wednesday before, and all the girls' heads were full of the uncleared-up mystery when Hester started on her little expedition.  Nothing was known; no fresh light had been thrown on the subject. Everything went on as usual within the school, and a casual observer would never have noticed the cloud which rested over that usually happy dwelling. A casual observer would have noticed little or no change in Annie Forest; her merry laugh was still heard, her light step still danced across the play-room floor, she was in her place in class, and was, if anything, a little more attentive and a little more successful over her lessons. Her pretty piquant face, her arch expression, the bright, quick and droll glance which she alone could give, were still to be seen; but those who knew her well and those who loved her best saw a change in Annie.  In the play-room she devoted herself exclusively to the little ones; she never went near Cecil Temple's drawing-room; she never mingled with the girls of the middle school as they clustered round the cheerful fire. At meal-times she ate little, and her room-fellow was heard to declare that she was awakened more than once in the middle of the night by the sound of Annie's sobs. In chapel, too, when she fancied herself quite unobserved, her face wore an expression of great pain; but if Mrs. Willis happened to glance in her direction, instantly the little mouth became demure and almost hard, the dark eyelashes were lowered over the bright eyes, the whole expression of the face showed the extreme of indifference. Hester felt more sure than ever of Annie's guilt; but one or two of the other girls in the school wavered in this opinion, and would have taken Annie out of \"Coventry\" had she herself made the smallest advance toward them.  Annie and Hester had not spoken to each other now for several days; but on this afternoon, which was a bright one in early spring, as Hester was changing her school-dress for her Sunday one, and preparing for her visit to the Misses Bruce, there came a light knock at her door. She said, \"Come in!\" rather impatiently, for she was in a hurry, and dreaded being kept.  To her surprise Annie Forest put in her curly head, and then, dancing with her usual light movement across the room, she laid a little bunch of dainty spring flowers on the dressing-table beside Hester.  Hester stared, first at the intruder, and then at the early primroses. She passionately loved flowers, and would have exclaimed with ecstasy at these had any one brought them in except Annie.  \"I want you,\" said Annie, rather timidly for her, \"to take these flowers from me to Miss Agnes and Miss Jane Bruce. It will be very kind of you if you will take them. I am sorry to have interrupted you--thank you very much.\"  She was turning away when Hester compelled herself to remark:  \"Is there any message with the flowers?\"  \"Oh, no--only Annie Forest's love. They'll understand----\" she turned half round as she spoke, and Hester saw that her eyes had filled with tears. She felt touched in spite of herself. There was something in Annie's face now which reminded her of her darling little Nan at home. She had seen the same beseeching, sorrowful look in Nan's brown eyes when she had wanted her friends to kiss her and take her to their hearts and love her.  Hester would not allow herself, however, to feel any tenderness toward Annie. Of course she was not really a bit like sweet little Nan, and it was absurd to suppose that a great girl like Annie could want caressing and petting and soothing; still, in spite of herself, Annie's look haunted her, and she took great care of the little flower-offering, and presented it with Annie's message instantly on her arrival to the little old ladies.  Miss Jane and Miss Agnes were very much pleased with the early primroses. They looked at one another and said:  \"Poor dear little girl,\" in tender voices, and then they put the flowers into one of their daintiest vases, and made much of them, and showed them to any visitors who happened to call that afternoon.  Their little house looked something like a doll's house to Hester, who had been accustomed all her life to large rooms and spacious passages; but it was the sweetest, daintiest, and most charming little abode in the world. It was not unlike a nest, and the Misses Bruce in certain ways resembled bright little robin redbreasts, so small, so neat, so chirrupy they were.  Hester enjoyed her afternoon immensely; the little ladies were right in their prophesy, and she was no longer lonely at school. She enjoyed talking about her schoolfellows, about her new life, about her studies. The Misses Bruce were decidedly fond of a gossip, but something which she could not at all define in their manner prevented Hester from retailing for their benefit any unkind news. They told her frankly at last that they were only interested in the good things which went on in the school, and that they found no pursuit so altogether delightful as finding out the best points in all the people they came across. They would not even laugh at sleepy, tiresome Susan Drummond; on the contrary, they pitied her, and Miss Jane wondered if the girl could be quite well, whereupon Miss Agnes shook her head, and said emphatically that it was Hester's duty to rouse poor Susy, and to make her waking life so interesting to her that she should no longer care to spend so many hours in the world of dreams.  There is such a thing as being so kind-hearted, so gentle, so charitable as to make the people who have not encouraged these virtues feel quite uncomfortable. By the mere force of contrast they begin to see themselves something as they really are. Since Hester had come to Lavender House she had taken very little pains to please others rather than herself, and she was now almost startled to see how she had allowed selfishness to get the better of her. While the Misses Bruce were speaking, old longings, which had slept since her mother's death, came back to the young girl, and she began to wish that she could be kinder to Susan Drummond, and that she could overcome her dislike to Annie Forest. She longed to say something about Annie to the little ladies, but they evidently did not wish to allude to the subject. When she was going away, they gave her a small parcel.  \"You will kindly give this to your schoolfellow, Miss Forest, Hester, dear,\" they both said, and then they kissed her, and said they hoped they should see her again; and Hester got into the old-fashioned school brougham, and held the brown paper parcel in her hand.  As she was going into the chapel that night, Mary Bell came up to her and whispered:  \"We have not got to the bottom of that mystery about Annie Forest yet. Mrs. Willis can evidently make nothing of her, and I believe Mr. Everard is going to talk to her after prayers to-night.\"  As she was speaking, Annie herself pushed rather rudely past the two girls; her face was flushed, and her hair was even more untidy than was its wont.  \"Here is a parcel for you, Miss Forest,\" said Hester, in a much more gentle tone than she was wont to use when she addressed this objectionable schoolmate.  All the girls were now filing into the chapel, and Hester should certainly not have presented the little parcel at that moment.  \"Breaking the rules, Miss Thornton,\" said Annie; \"all right, toss it here.\" Then, as Hester failed to comply, she ran back, knocking her schoolfellows out of place, and, snatching the parcel from Hester's hand, threw it high in the air. This was a piece of not only willful audacity and disobedience, but it even savored of the profane, for Annie's step was on the threshold of the chapel, and the parcel fell with a noisy bang on the floor some feet inside the little building.  \"Bring me that parcel, Annie Forest,\" whispered the stern voice of the head-mistress.  Annie sullenly complied; but when she came up to Mrs. Willis, her governess took her hand, and pushed her down into a low seat a little behind her.     CHAPTER XVI.  \"AN ENEMY HATH DONE THIS.\"   The short evening service was over, and one by one, in orderly procession, the girls left the chapel. Annie was about to rise to her feet to follow her school-companions, when Mrs. Willis stooped down, and whispered something in her ear. Her face became instantly suffused with a dull red; she resumed her seat, and buried her face in both her hands. One or two of the girls noticed her despondent attitude as they left the chapel, and Cecil Temple looked back with a glance of such unutterable sympathy that Annie's proud, suffering little heart would have been touched could she but have seen the look.  Presently the young steps died away, and Annie, raising her head, saw that she was alone with Mr. Everard, who seated himself in the place which Mrs. Willis had occupied by her side.  \"Your governess has asked me to speak to you, my dear,\" he said, in his kind and fatherly tones; \"she wants us to discuss this thing which is making you so unhappy quite fully together.\" Here the clergyman paused, and noticing a sudden wistful and soft look in the girl's brown eyes, he continued: \"Perhaps, however, you have something to say to me which will throw light on this mystery?\"  \"No, sir, I have nothing to say,\" replied Annie, and now again the sullen expression passed like a wave over her face.  \"Poor child,\" said Mr. Everard. \"Perhaps, Annie,\" he continued, \"you do not quite understand me--you do not quite read my motive in talking to you to-night. I am not here in any sense to reprove you. You are either guilty of this sin, or you are not guilty. In either case I pity you; it is very hard, very bitter, to be falsely accused--I pity you much if this is the case; but it is still harder, Annie, still more bitter, still more absolutely crushing to be accused of a sin which we are trying to conceal. In that terrible case God Himself hides His face. Poor child, poor child, I pity you most of all if you are guilty.\"  Annie had again covered her face, and bowed her head over her hands. She did not speak for a moment, but presently Mr. Everard heard a low sob, and then another, and another, until at last her whole frame was shaken with a perfect tempest of weeping.  The old clergyman, who had seen many strange phases of human nature, who had in his day comforted and guided more than one young school-girl, was far too wise to do anything to check this flow of grief. He knew Annie would speak more fully and more frankly when her tears were over. He was right. She presently raised a very tear-stained face to the clergyman.  \"I felt very bitter at your coming to speak to me,\" she began. \"Mrs. Willis has always sent for you when everything else has failed with us girls, and I did not think she would treat me so. I was determined not to say anything to you. Now, however, you have spoken good words to me, and I can't turn away from you. I will tell you all that is in my heart. I will promise before God to conceal nothing, if only you will do one thing for me.\"  \"What is that, my child?\"  \"Will you believe me?\"  \"Undoubtedly.\"  \"Ah, but you have not been tried yet. I thought Mrs. Willis would certainly believe; but she said the circumstantial evidence was too strong--perhaps it will be too strong for you.\"  \"I promise to believe you, Annie Forest; if, before God, you can assure me that you are speaking the whole truth, I will fully believe you.\"  Annie paused again, then she rose from her seat and stood a pace away from the old minister.  \"This is the truth before God,\" she said, as she locked her two hands together and raised her eyes freely and unshrinkingly to Mr. Everard's face.  \"I have always loved Mrs. Willis. I have reasons for loving her which the girls don't know about. The girls don't know that when my mother was dying she gave me into Mrs. Willis' charge, and she said, 'You must keep Annie until her father comes back.' Mother did not know where father was; but she said he would be sure to come back some day, and look for mother and me; and Mrs. Willis said she would keep me faithfully until father came to claim me. That is four years ago, and my father has never come, nor have I heard of him, and I think, I am almost sure, that the little money which mother left must be all used up. Mrs. Willis never says anything about money, and she did not wish me to tell my story to the girls. None of them know except Cecil Temple. I am sure some day father will come home, and he will give Mrs. Willis back the money she has spent on me; but never, never, never can he repay her for her goodness to me. You see I cannot help loving Mrs. Willis. It is quite impossible for any girl to have such a friend and not to love her. I know I am very wild, and that I do all sorts of mad things. It seems to me that I cannot help myself sometimes; but I would not willingly, indeed, I would not willingly hurt anybody. Last Wednesday, as you know, there was a great disturbance in the school. Dora Russell's desk was tampered with, and so was Cecil Temple's. You know, of course, what was found in both the desks. Mrs. Willis sent for me, and asked me about the caricature which was drawn in Cecil's book. I looked at it and I told her the truth. I did not conceal one thing. I told her the whole truth as far as I knew it. She did not believe me. She said so. What more could I do then?\"  Here Annie paused; she began to unclasp and clasp her hands, and she looked full at Mr. Everard with a most pleading expression.  \"Do you mind repeating to me exactly what you said to your governess?\" he questioned.  \"I said this, sir. I said, 'Yes, Mrs. Willis, I did draw that caricature. You will scarcely understand how I, who love you so much, could have been so mad and ungrateful as to do anything to turn you into ridicule. I would cut off my right hand now not to have done it; but I did do it, and I must tell you the truth.' 'Tell me, dear,' she said, quite gently then. 'It was one wet afternoon about a fortnight ago,' I said to her; 'a lot of us middle-school girls were sitting together, and I had a pencil and some bits of paper, and I was making up funny little groups of a lot of us, and the girls were screaming with laughter, for somehow I managed to make the likeness that I wanted in each case. It was very wrong of me, I know. It was against the rules, but I was in one of my maddest humors, and I really did not care what the consequences were. At last one of the girls said: 'You won't dare to make a picture like that of Mrs. Willis, Annie--you know you won't dare.' The minute she said that name I began to feel ashamed. I remembered I was breaking one of the rules, and I suddenly tore up all my bits of paper and flung them into the fire, and I said: 'No, I would not dare to show her dishonor.' Well, afterward, as I was washing my hands for tea up in my room, the temptation came over me so strongly that I felt I could not resist it, to make a funny little sketch of Mrs. Willis. I had a little scrap of thin paper, and I took out my pencil and did it all in a minute. It seemed to me very funny, and I could not help laughing at it; and then I thrust it into my private writing-case, which I always keep locked, and I put the key in my pocket and ran downstairs. I forgot all about the caricature. I had never shown it to any one. How it got into Cecil's book is more than I can say. When I had finished speaking Mrs. Willis looked very hard at the book. 'You are right,' she said; 'this caricature is drawn on a very thin piece of paper, which has been cleverly pasted on the title-page.' Then, Mr. Everard, she asked me a lot of questions. Had I ever parted with my keys? Had I ever left my desk unlocked? 'No,' I said, 'my desk is always locked, and my keys are always in my pocket. Indeed,' I added, 'my keys were absolutely safe for the last week, for they went in a white petticoat to the wash, and came back as rusty as possible.' I could not open my desk for a whole week, which was a great nuisance. I told all this story to Mrs. Willis, and she said to me: 'You are positively certain that this caricature has been taken out of your desk by somebody else, and pasted in here? You are sure that the caricature you drew is not to be found in your desk?' 'Yes,' I said; 'how can I be anything but sure; these are my pencil marks, and that is the funny little turn I gave to your neck which made me laugh when I drew it. Yes; I am certainly sure.'  \"'I have always been told, Annie,' Mrs. Willis said, 'that you are the only girl in the school who can draw these caricatures. You have never seen an attempt at this kind of drawing among your schoolfellows, or among any of the teachers?'  \"'I have never seen any of them try this special kind of drawing,' I said. 'I wish I was like them. I wish I had never, never done it.'  \"'You have got your keys now?' Mrs. Willis said.  \"'Yes,' I answered, pulling them all covered with rust out of my pocket.  \"Then she told me to leave the keys on the table, and to go upstairs and fetch down my little private desk.  \"I did so, and she made me put the rusty key in the lock and open the desk, and together we searched through its contents. We pulled out everything, or rather I did, and I scattered all my possessions about on the table, and then I looked up almost triumphantly at Mrs. Willis.  \"'You see the caricature is not here,' I said; 'somebody picked the lock and took it away.'  \"'This lock has not been picked,' Mrs. Willis said; 'and what is that little piece of white paper sticking out of the private drawer?'  \"'Oh, I forgot my private drawer,' I said; 'but there is nothing in it--nothing whatever,' and then I touched the spring, and pulled it open, and there lay the little caricature which I had drawn in the bottom of the drawer. There it lay, not as I had left it, for I had never put it into the private drawer. I saw Mrs. Willis' face turn very white, and I noticed that her hands trembled. I was all red myself, and very hot, and there was a choking lump in my throat, and I could not have got a single word out even if I had wished to. So I began scrambling the things back into my desk, as hard as ever I could, and then I locked it, and put the rusty keys back in my pocket.  \"'What am I to believe now, Annie?' Mrs. Willis said.  \"'Believe anything you like now,' I managed to say; and then I took my desk and walked out of the room, and would not wait even though she called me back.  \"That is the whole story, Mr. Everard,\" continued Annie. \"I have no explanation whatever to give. I did make the one caricature of my dear governess. I did not make the other. The second caricature is certainly a copy of the first, but I did not make it. I don't know who made it. I have no light whatever to throw on the subject. You see after all,\" added Annie Forest, raising her eyes to the clergyman's face, \"it is impossible for you to believe me. Mrs. Willis does not believe me, and you cannot be expected to. I don't suppose you are to be blamed. I don't see how you can help yourself.\"  \"The circumstantial evidence is very strong against you, Annie,\" replied the clergyman; \"still, I promised to believe, and I have no intention of going back from my word. If, in the presence of God in this little church, you would willingly and deliberately tell me a lie I should never trust human being again. No, Annie Forest, you have many faults, but you are not a liar. I see the impress of truth on your brow, in your eyes, on your lips. This is a very painful mystery, my child; but I believe you. I am going to see Mrs. Willis now. God bless you, Annie. Be brave, be courageous, don't foster malice in your heart to any unknown enemy. An enemy has truly done this thing, poor child; but God Himself will bring this mystery to light. Trust Him, my dear; and now I am going to see Mrs. Willis.\"  While Mr. Everard was speaking, Annie's whole expressive face had changed; the sullen look had left it; the eyes were bright with renewed hope; the lips had parted in smiles. There was a struggle for speech, but no words came: the young girl stooped down and raised the old clergyman's withered hands to her lips.  \"Let me stay here a little longer,\" she managed to say at last; and then he left her.     CHAPTER XVII.  \"THE SWEETS ARE POISONED.\"   \"I think, my dear madam,\" said Mr. Everard to Mrs. Willis, \"that you must believe your pupil. She has not refused to confess to you from any stubbornness, but from the simple reason that she has nothing to confess. I am firmly convinced that things are as she stated them, Mrs. Willis. There is a mystery here which we neither of us can explain, but which we must unravel.\"  Then Mrs. Willis and the clergyman had a long and anxious talk together. It lasted for a long time, and some of its results at least were manifest the next morning, for, just before the morning's work began, Mrs. Willis came to the large school-room, and, calling Annie Forest to her side, laid her hand on the young girl's shoulder.  \"I wish to tell you all, young ladies,\" she said, \"that I completely and absolutely exonerate Annie Forest from having any part in the disgraceful occurrence which took place in this school-room a short time ago. I allude, of course, as you all know, to the book which was found tampered with in Cecil Temple's desk. Some one else in this room is guilty, and the mystery has still to be unraveled, and the guilty girl has still to come forward and declare herself. If she is willing at this moment to come to me here, and fully and freely confess her sin, I will quite forgive her.\"  The head mistress paused, and, still with her hand on Annie's shoulder, looked anxiously down the long room. The love and forgiveness which she felt shone in her eyes at this moment. No girl need have feared aught but tenderness from her just then.  No one stirred; the moment passed, and a look of sternness returned to the mistress' fine face.  \"No,\" she said, in her emphatic and clear tones, \"the guilty girl prefers waiting until God discovers her sin for her. My dear, whoever you are, that hour is coming, and you cannot escape from it. In the meantime, girls, I wish you all to receive Annie Forest as quite innocent. I believe in her, so does Mr. Everard, and so must you. Any one who treats Miss Forest except as a perfectly innocent and truthful girl incurs my severe displeasure. My dear, you may return to your seat.\"  Annie, whose face was partly hidden by her curly hair during the greater part of this speech, now tossed it back, and raised her brown eyes with a look of adoration in them to her teacher. Mrs. Willis' face, however, still looked harassed. Her eyes met Annie's, but no corresponding glow was kindled in them; their glance was just, calm, but cold.  The childish heart was conscious of a keen pang of agony, and Annie went back to her lessons without any sense of exultation.  The fact was this: Mrs. Willis' judgment and reason had been brought round by Mr. Everard's words, but in her heart of hearts, almost unknown to herself, there still lingered a doubt of the innocence of her wayward and pretty pupil. She said over and over to herself that she really now quite believed in Annie Forest, but then would come those whisperings from her pained and sore heart.  \"Why did she ever make a caricature of one who has been as a mother to her? If she made one caricature, could she not make another? Above all things, if _she_ did not do it, who did?\"  Mrs. Willis turned away from these unpleasant whispers--she would not let them stay with her, and turned a deaf ear to their ugly words. She had publicly declared in the school her belief in Annie's absolute innocence, but at the moment when her pupil looked up at her with a world of love and adoration in her gaze, she found to her own infinite distress that she could not give her the old love.  Annie went back to her companions, and bent her head over her lessons, and tried to believe that she was very thankful and very happy, and Cecil Temple managed to whisper a gentle word of congratulation to her, and at the twelve o'clock walk Annie perceived that a few of her schoolfellows looked at her with friendly eyes again. She perceived now that when she went into the play-room she was not absolutely tabooed, and that, if she chose, she might speedily resume her old reign of popularity. Annie had, to a remarkable extent, the gift of inspiring love, and her old favorites would quickly have flocked back to their sovereign had she so willed it. It is certainly true that the girls to whom the whole story was known in all its bearings found it difficult to understand how Annie could be innocent; but Mr. Everard's and Mrs. Willis' assertions were too potent to be disregarded, and most of the girls were only too willing to let the whole affair slide from their minds, and to take back their favorite Annie to their hearts again.  Annie, however, herself did not so will it. In the play-room she fraternized with the little ones who were alike her friends in adversity and sunshine; she rejected almost coldly the overtures of her old favorites, but played, and romped, and was merry with the children of the sixth class. She even declined Cecil's invitation to come and sit with her in her drawing-room.  \"Oh, no,\" she said. \"I hate being still; I am in no humor for talk. Another time, Cecil, another time. Now then, Sybil, my beauty, get well on my back, and I'll be the willing dog carrying you round and round the room.\"  Annie's face had not a trace of care or anxiety on it, but her eyes would not quite meet Cecil's, and Cecil sighed as she turned away, and her heart, too, began to whisper little, mocking, ugly doubts of poor Annie.  During the half-hour before tea that evening Annie was sitting on the floor with a small child in her lap, and two other little ones tumbling about her, when she was startled by a shower of lollipops being poured over her head, down her neck, and into her lap. She started up and met the sleepy gaze of Susan Drummond.  \"That's to congratulate you, miss,\" said Susan; \"you're a very lucky girl to have escaped as you did.\"  The little ones began putting Susan's lollipops vigorously into their mouths. Annie sprang to her feet shaking the sticky sweetmeats out of her dress on to the floor.  \"What have I escaped from?\" she asked, turning round and facing her companion haughtily.  \"Oh, dear me!\" said Susan, stepping back a pace or two. \"I--ah--\" stifling a yawn--\"I only meant you were very near getting into an ugly scrape. It's no affair of mine, I'm sure; only I thought you'd like the lollipops.\"  \"No, I don't like them at all,\" said Annie, \"nor you, either. Go back to your own companions, please.\"  Susan sulkily walked away, and Annie stooped down on the floor.  \"Now, little darlings,\" she said, \"you mustn't eat those. No, no, they are not good at all; and they have come from one of Annie's enemies. Most likely they are full of poison. Let us collect them all, every one, and we will throw them into the fire before we go to tea.\"  \"But I don't think there's any poison in them,\" said little Janie West in a regretful tone, as she gobbled down a particularly luscious chocolate cream; \"they are all big, and fat, and bursty, and _so_ sweet, Annie, dear.\"  \"Never mind, Janie, they are dangerous sweeties all the same. Come, come, throw them into my apron, and I will run over and toss them into the fire, and we'll have time for a game of leap-frog before tea; oh, fie, Judy,\" as a very small fat baby began to whimper, \"you would not eat the sweeties of one of Annie's enemies.\"  This last appeal was successful. The children made a valiant effort, and dashed the tempting goodies into Annie's alapaca apron. When they were all collected, she marched up the play-room and in the presence of Susan Drummond, Hester Thornton, Cecil Temple, and several more of her school companions, threw them into the fire.  \"So much for _that_ overture, Miss Drummond,\" she said, making a mock courtesy, and returning once more to the children.     CHAPTER XVIII.  IN THE HAMMOCK.   Just at this time the weather suddenly changed. After the cold and dreariness of winter came soft spring days--came longer evenings and brighter mornings.  Hester Thornton found that she could dress by daylight, then that she was no longer cold and shivering when she reached the chapel, then that she began intensely to enjoy her mid-day walk, then that she found her winter things a little too hot, until at last, almost suddenly it seemed to the expectant and anxious girls, glorious spring weather broke upon the world, the winds were soft and westerly, the buds swelled and swelled into leaf on the trees, and the flowers bloomed in the delightful old-fashioned gardens of Lavender House. Instantly, it seemed to the girls, their whole lives had altered. The play-room was deserted or only put up with on wet days. At twelve o'clock, instead of taking a monotonous walk on the roads, they ran races, played tennis, croquet, or any other game they liked best in the gardens. Later on in the day, when the sun was not so powerful, they took their walk; but even then they had time to rush back to their beloved shady garden for a little time before tea and preparation for their next day's work. Easter came this year about the middle of April, and Easter found these girls almost enjoying summer weather. How they looked forward to their few Easter holidays! what plans they made, what tennis matches were arranged, what games and amusements of all sorts were in anticipation! Mrs. Willis herself generally went away for a few days at Easter; so did the French governess, and the school was nominally placed under the charge of Miss Good and Miss Danesbury. Mrs. Willis did not approve of long Easter holidays; she never gave more than a week, and in consequence only the girls who lived quite near went home. Out of the fifty girls who resided at Lavender House about ten went away at Easter; the remaining forty stayed behind, and were often heard to declare that holidays at Lavender House were the most delightful things in the world.  At this particular Easter time the girls were rather surprised to hear that Mrs. Willis had made up her mind not to go away as usual; Miss Good was to have a holiday, and Mrs. Willis and Miss Danesbury were to look after the school. This was felt to be an unusual, indeed unheard of, proceeding, and the girls commented about it a good deal, and somehow, without absolutely intending to do so, they began to settle in their own minds that Mrs. Willis was staying in the school on account of Annie Forest, and that in her heart of hearts she did not absolutely believe in her innocence. Mrs. Willis certainly gave the girls no reason to come to this conclusion; she was consistently kind to Annie, and had apparently quite restored her to her old place in her favor. Annie was more gentle than of old, and less inclined to get into scrapes; but the girls loved her far less in her present unnatural condition of reserve and good behavior than they did in her old daring and hoydenish days. Cecil Temple always spent Easter with an old aunt who lived in a neighboring town; she openly said this year that she did not wish to go away, but her governess would not allow her to change her usual plans, and she left Lavender House with a curious feeling of depression and coming trouble. As she was getting into the cab which was to take her to the station Annie flew to her side, threw a great bouquet of flowers which she had gathered into her lap, and, flinging her arms tightly round her neck, whispered suddenly and passionately:  \"Oh, Cecil, believe in me.\"  \"I--I--I don't know that I don't,\" said Cecil, rather lamely.  \"No, Cecil, you don't--not in your heart of hearts. Neither you nor Mrs. Willis--you neither of you believe in me from the very bottom of your hearts; oh, it is hard!\"  Annie gave vent to a little sob, sprang away from Cecil's arms, and disappeared into a shrubbery close by.  She stayed there until the sound of the retreating cab died away in the avenue, then, tossing back her hair, rearranging her rather tattered garden hat, and hastily wiping some tears from her eyes, she came out from her retreat, and began to look around her for some amusement. What should she do? Where should she go? How should she occupy herself? Sounds of laughter and merriment filled the air; the garden was all alive with gay young figures running here and there. Girls stood in groups under the horse-chestnut tree--girls walked two and two up the shady walk at the end of the garden--little ones gamboled and rolled on the grass--a tennis match was going on vigorously, and the croquet ground was occupied by eight girls of the middle school. Annie was one of the most successful tennis players in the school; she had indeed a gift for all games of skill, and seldom missed her mark. Now she looked with a certain wistful longing toward the tennis-court; but, after a brief hesitation, she turned away from it and entered the shady walk at the farther end of the garden. As she walked along, slowly, meditatively, and sadly, her eyes suddenly lighted up. Glancing to one of the tall trees she saw a hammock suspended there which had evidently been forgotten during the winter. The tree was not yet quite in leaf, and it was very easy for Annie to climb up its branches to re-adjust the hammock, and to get into it. After its winter residence in the tree this soft couch was found full of withered leaves, and otherwise rather damp and uncomfortable. Annie tossed the leaves on to the ground, and laughed as she swung herself gently backward and forward. Early as the season still was the sun was so bright and the air so soft that she could not but enjoy herself, and she laughed with pleasure, and only wished that she had a fairy tale by her side to help to soothe her off to sleep.  In the distance she heard some children calling \"Annie,\" \"Annie Forest;\" but she was far too comfortable and too lazy to answer them, and presently she closed her eyes and really did fall asleep.  She was awakened by a very slight sound--by nothing more nor less than the gentle and very refined conversation of two girls, who sat under the oak tree in which Annie's hammock swung. Hearing the voices, she bent a little forward, and saw that the speakers were Dora Russell and Hester Thornton. Her first inclination was to laugh, toss down some leaves, and instantly reveal herself; the next she drew back hastily, and began to listen with all her ears.  \"I never liked her,\" said Hester--\"I never even from the very first pretended to like her. I think she is under-bred, and not fit to associate with the other girls in the school-room.\"  \"She is treated with most unfair partiality,\" retorted Miss Russell in her thin and rather bitter voice. \"I have not the smallest doubt, not the smallest, that she was guilty of putting those messes into my desk, of destroying my composition, and of caricaturing Mrs. Willis in Cecil Temple's book. I wonder after that Mrs. Willis did not see through her, but it is astonishing to what lengths favoritism will carry one. Mrs. Willis and Mr. Everard are behaving in a very unfair way to the rest of us in upholding this commonplace, disagreeable girl; but it will be to Mrs. Willis' own disadvantage. Hester, I am, as you know, leaving school at midsummer, and I shall certainly use all my influence to induce my father and mother not to send the younger girls here; they could not associate with a person like Miss Forest.\"  \"I never take much notice of her,\" said Hester; \"but of course what you say is quite right, Dora. You have great discrimination, and your sisters might possibly be taken in by her.\"  \"Oh, not at all, I assure you; they know a true lady when they see her. However, they must not be imperilled. I will ask my parents to send them to Mdlle. Lablanch. I hear that her establishment is most _recherch_.\"  \"Mrs. Willis is very nice herself, and so are most of the girls,\" said Hester, after a pause. Then they were both silent, for Hester had stooped down to examine some little fronds and moss which grew at the foot of the tree. After a pause, Hester said:  \"I don't think Annie is the favorite she was with the girls.\"  \"Oh, of course not; they all, in their heart of hearts, know she is guilty. Will you come indoors, and have tea with me in my drawing-room, Hester?\"  The two girls walked slowly away, and presently Annie let herself gently out of her hammock and dropped to the ground.  She had heard every word; she had not revealed herself, and a new and terrible--and, truth to say, absolutely foreign--sensation from her true nature now filled her mind. She felt that she almost hated these two who had spoken so cruelly, so unjustly of her. She began to trace her misfortunes and her unhappiness to the date of Hester's entrance into the school. Even more than Dora Russell did she dislike Hester; she made up her mind to revenge herself on both these girls. Her heart was very, very sore; she missed the old words, the old love, the old brightness, the old popularity; she missed the mother-tones in Mrs. Willis' voice--her heart cried out for them, at night she often wept for them. She became more and more sure that she owed all her misfortunes to Hester, and in a smaller degree to Dora. Dora believed that she had deliberately insulted her, and injured her composition, when she knew herself that she was quite innocent of even harboring such a thought, far less carrying it into effect. Well, now, she would really do something to injure both these girls, and perhaps the carrying out of her revenge would satisfy her sore heart.     CHAPTER XIX.  CUP AND BALL.   Just toward the end of the Easter holidays, Hester Thornton was thrown into a great tumult of excitement, of wonder, of half regret and half joy, by a letter which she received from her father. In this letter he informed her that he had made up his mind to break up his establishment for several years, to go abroad, and to leave Hester altogether under Mrs. Willis' care.  When Hester had read so far, she flung her letter on the table, put her head into her hands, and burst into tears.  \"Oh, how cruel of father!\" she exclaimed; \"how am I to live without ever going home--how am I to endure life without seeing my little Nan?\"  Hester cried bitterly; the strongest love of her nature was now given to this pretty and sweet little sister, and dismal pictures rose rapidly before her of Nan growing up without in the least remembering her--perhaps, still worse, of Nan being unkindly treated and neglected by strangers. After a long pause, she raised her head, wiped her eyes, and resumed her letter. Now, indeed, she started with astonishment, and gave an exclamation of delight--Sir John Thornton had arranged that Mrs. Willis was also to receive little Nan, although she was younger than any other child present in the school. Hester scarcely waited to finish her letter. She crammed it into her pocket, rushed up to Susan Drummond, and astonished that placid young lady by suddenly kissing her.  \"Nan is coming, Susy!\" she exclaimed; \"dear, darling, lovely little Nan is coming--oh, I am so happy!\"  She was far too impatient to explain matters to stolid Susan, and danced down stairs, her eyes sparkling and smiles on her lips. It was nothing to her now how long she stayed at school--her heart's treasure would be with her there, and she could not but feel happy.  After breakfast Mrs. Willis sent for her, and told her what arrangements were being made; she said that she was going to remove Susan Drummond out of Hester's bedroom, in order that Hester might enjoy her little sister's company at night. She spoke very gently, and entered with full sympathy into the girl's delight over the little motherless sister, and Hester felt more drawn to her governess than she had ever been.  Nan was to arrive at Lavender House on the following evening, and for the first week her nurse was to remain with her until she got accustomed to her new life.  The morning of the day of Nan's arrival was also the last of the Easter holidays, and Hester, awakening earlier than her wont, lay in bed, and planned what she would do to welcome the little one.  The idea of having Nan with her continually had softened Hester. She was not unhappy in her school-life--indeed, there was much in its monotonous, busy, and healthy occupation to stimulate and rouse the good in her. Her intellect was being vigorously exercised, and, by contact with her schoolfellows, her character was being molded; but the perfect harmony and brightness of the school had been much interrupted since Hester's arrival; her dislike to Annie Forest had been unfortunate in more ways than one, and that dislike, which was increasing each day, was hardening Hester's heart.  But it was not hard this morning--all that was sweetest, and softest, and best in her had come to the surface--the little sister, whom her mother had left in her charge, was now to be her daily and hourly companion. For Nan's sake, then, she must be very good; her deeds must be gentle and kind, and her thoughts charitable. Hester had an instinctive feeling that baby eyes saw deep below the surface; Hester felt if Nan were to lose even a shadow of her faith in her she could almost die of shame.  Hester had been very proud of Dora Russell's friendship. Never before had it been known in the school that a first-class girl took a third into such close companionship, and Hester's little head had been slightly turned by the fact. Her better judgment and her better nature had been rather blinded by the fascinations of this tall, graceful, satirical Dora. She had been weak enough to agree with Dora with her lips when in her heart of hearts she knew she was all wrong. By nature Hester was an honorable girl, with many fine traits in her character--by nature Dora was small and mean and poor of soul.  This morning Hester ran up to her favorite.  \"Little Nan is coming to-night,\" she said.  Dora was talking at the moment to Miss Maitland, another first-class girl, and the two stared rather superciliously at Hester, and, after a pause, Dora said in her finest drawl:  \"Who _is_ little Nan?\"  It was Hester's turn to stare, for she had often spoken of Nan to this beloved friend, who had listened to her narrative and had appeared to sympathize.  \"My little sister, of course,\" she exclaimed. \"I have often talked to you about her, Dora. Are you not glad she is coming?\"  \"No, my dear child, I can't say that I am. If you wish to retain my friendship, Hester, you must be careful to keep the little mite away from me; I can't bear small children.\"  Hester walked away with her heart swelling, and she fancied she heard the two elder girls laughing as she left the play-room.  Many other girls, however, in the school thoroughly sympathized with Hester, and among them no one was more delighted than Susan Drummond.  \"I am awfully good-natured not to be as cross as two sticks, Hetty,\" she exclaimed, \"for I am being turned out of my comfortable room; and whose room do you suppose I am now to share? why, that little imp Annie Forest's.\" But Hester felt charitable, even toward Annie, on this happy day.  In the evening little Nan arrived. She was a very pretty, dimpled, brown-eyed creature, of just three years of age. She had all the imperious ways of a spoilt baby, and, evidently, fear was a word not to be found in her vocabulary. She clung to Hester, but smiled and nodded to the other girls, who made advances to her, and petted her, and thought her a very charming baby. Beside Nan, all the other little girls in the school looked old. She was quite two years the youngest, and it was soon very evident that she would establish that most imperious of all reigns--a baby reign--in the school.  Hester fondled her and talked to her, and the little thing sat on her knee and stroked her face.  \"Me like 'oo, Hetty,\" she said several times, and she added many other endearing and pretty words which caused Hester's heart to swell with delight.  In the midst of their happy little talk together Annie Forest, in her usual careless fashion, entered the play-room. She alone, of all the girls, had taken no notice of the new plaything. She walked to her usual corner, sat down on the floor, and began to play cup and ball for the benefit of two or three of the smallest children. Hester did not regard her in the least; she sat with Nan on her knee, stroking back her sunny curls, and remarking on her various charms to several of the girls who sat round her.  \"See, how pretty that dimple in her chin is,\" she said, \"and oh, my pet, your eyes look wiser, and bigger, and saucier than ever. Look at me, Nan; look at your own Hetty.\"  Nan's attention, however, was diverted by the gaily-painted cup and ball which Annie was using with her wonted dexterity.  \"Dat a pitty toy,\" she said, giving one quick and rather solemn glance at her sister, and again fixing her admiring gaze on the cup and ball.  Annie Forest had heard the words, and she darted a sudden, laughing look at the little one. Annie's power over children was well known. Nan began to wriggle on Hester's knee.  \"Dat a pitty lady,\" she said again, \"and that a pitty, tibby [little] toy; Nan go see.\"  In an instant, before Hester could prevent her, she had trotted across the room, and was kneeling with the other children and shouting with delight over Annie's play.  \"She'll get her, you'll see, Hester,\" said one of the girls maliciously; \"she'll soon be much fonder of Annie Forest than of you. Annie wins the heart of every little child in the school.\"  \"She won't win my Nan's from me,\" said Hester in a confident tone; but in spite of her words a great pang of jealousy had gone through her. She rose to her seat and followed her little sister.  \"Nan, you are sleepy, you must go to bed.\"  \"No, no, Hetty; me not s'eepy, me kite awake; go 'way, Hetty, Nan want to see the pitty tibby toy.\"  Annie raised her eyes to Hester's. She did not really want to be unkind, and at that moment it had certainty never entered into her head to steal Hester's treasure from her, but she could not help a look of suppressed delight and triumph filling her eyes.  Hester could scarcely bear the look; she stooped down, and taking one of Nan's little dimpled hands tried to drag her away.  Instantly Annie threw the cup and ball on the floor.  \"The play is all over to-night, little darling,\" she said; \"give Annie Forest one kiss, and run to bed with sister Hester.\"  Nan, who had been puckering up her face to cry, smiled instantly; then she scrambled to her feet, and flung her little fat arms round Annie's neck.  \"Dat a vedy pitty p'ay,\" she said in a patronizing tone, \"and me like 'oo, me do.\"  Then she gave her hand willingly to Hester, and trotted out of the play-room by her side.     CHAPTER XX.  IN THE SOUTH PARLOR.   Immediately after Easter the real excitement of the school-year began. All the girls who had ambition, who had industry, and who had a desire to please distant fathers, mothers, or guardians, worked hard for that great day at midsummer when Mrs. Willis distributed her valuable prizes.  From the moment of Hester's entrance into the school she had heard this day spoken of. It was, without doubt, the greatest day of the year at Lavender House. Smaller prizes were given at Christmas, but the great honors were always reserved for this long sunshiny June day, when Mrs. Willis herself presented her marks of approbation to her successful pupils.  The girls who had lived in the school for two or three years gave Hester vivid descriptions of the excitements, the pleasures, the delights of this day of days. In the first place it was the first of the holidays, in the second it was spent almost from morning to night in the open air--for a great tent was erected on the lawn; and visitors thronged to Lavender House, and fathers and mothers, and aunts and uncles, arrived from a distance to witness the triumphs of the favored children who had won the prizes. The giving away of the prizes was, of course, _the_ event of the day; but there were many other minor joys. Always in the evenings there was some special entertainment. These entertainments differed from year to year, Mrs. Willis allowing the girls to choose them for themselves, and only making one proviso, that they must take all the trouble, and all the pains--in short, that they themselves must be the entertainers. One year they had tableaux vivants; another a fancy ball, every pretty dress of which had been designed by themselves, and many even made by their own industrious little fingers. Mrs. Willis delighted in the interest and occupation that this yearly entertainment gave to her pupils, and she not only encouraged them in their efforts to produce something very unique and charming, but took care that they should have sufficient time to work up their ideas properly. Always after Easter she gave the girls of the three first classes two evenings absolutely to themselves; and these they spent in a pretty room called the south parlor, which belonged to Mrs. Willis' part of the house, and was rarely used, except for these great preparations.  Hester, therefore, after Easter found her days very full indeed. Every spare moment she devoted to little Nan, but she was quite determined to win a substantial prize, and she was also deeply interested in various schemes proposed in the south parlor.  With regard to prizes, Mrs. Willis also went on a plan of her own. Each girl was expected to come up to a certain standard of excellence in all her studies, and if she fell very much below this standard she was not allowed to try for any prize; if she came up to it, she could select one subject, but only one, for competition.  On the Monday after the Easter holidays the special subjects for the midsummer prizes were given out, and the girls were expected to send in their answers as to the special prize they meant to compete for by the following Friday.  When this day arrived Hester Thornton and Dora Russell both discovered that they had made the same choice--they were going to try for the English composition prize. This subject always obtained one of the most costly prizes, and several of the girls shook their heads over Hester's choice.  \"You are very silly to try for that, Hetty,\" they exclaimed, \"for Mrs. Willis has such queer ideas with regard to English composition. Of course, we go in for it in a general way, and learn the rules of grammar and punctuation, and so forth, but Mrs. Willis says that schoolgirls' themes are so bad and affected, as a rule, and she says she does not think any one will go in for her pet prize who has not natural ability. In consequence, she gives only one prize for composition between the three first classes. You had better change your mind, Hetty, before it is too late, for much older girls will compete with you, and there are several who are going to try.\"  Hester, however, only smiled, and assured her eager friend that she would stick to her pet subject, and try to do the best she could.  On the morning when the girls signified their choice of subject, Mrs. Willis came into the school-room and made one of her little yearly speeches with regard to the right spirit in which her girls should try for these honors. The few and well-chosen words of the head mistress generally roused those girls who loved her best to a fever of enthusiasm, and even Hester, who was comparatively a newcomer, felt a great wish, as she listened to that clear and vibrating voice and watched the many expressions which passed over the noble face, that she might find something beyond the mere earthly honor and glory of success in this coming trial. Having finished her little speech, Mrs. Willis made several remarks with regard to the choice of subjects. She spoke of the English composition prize last, and here she heightened the interest and excitement which always hung around this special prize. Contrary to her usual rule, she would this year give no subject for an English theme. Each girl might choose what pleased her best.  On hearing these words Annie Forest, who had been sitting by her desk looking rather dull and dejected, suddenly sprang to her feet, her face aglow, her eyes sparkling, and began whispering vigorously to Miss Good.  Miss Good nodded, and, going up to Mrs. Willis, said aloud that Annie had changed her mind, and that from not wishing to try for any of the prizes, she now intended to compete for the English composition.  Mrs. Willis looked a little surprised, but without any comment she immediately entered Annie's name in the list of competitors, and Annie sat down again, not even glancing at her astonished schoolfellows, who could not conceal their amazement, for she had never hitherto shown the slightest desire to excel in this department.  On the evening of this Friday the girls of the three first classes assembled for the first time in the south parlor. Hitherto these meetings had been carried on in a systematic and business-like fashion. It was impossible for all the girls who belonged to these three large classes to assemble on each occasion. Careful selections, therefore, were, as a rule, made from their numbers. These girls formed a committee to superintend and carry on the real preparations for the coming treat, and the others only met when specially summoned by the committee to appear.  As usual now the three classes found themselves in the south parlor--as usual they chattered volubly, and started schemes, to reject them again with peals of laughter. Many ideas were put forward, to be cast aside as utterly worthless. No one seemed to have any very brilliant thought, and as the first step on these occasions was to select what the entertainment should be, proceedings seemed to come to a standstill.  The fact was the most daring originator, the one whose ideas were always flavored with a spice of novelty, was absolutely silent.  Cecil Temple, who had taken a seat near Annie, suddenly bent forward and spoke to her aloud.  \"We have all said what we would like, and we none of us appear to have thought of anything at all worth having,\" she said; \"but you have not spoken at all, Annie. Give us an idea, dear--you know you originated the fancy ball last year.\"  Thus publicly appealed to, Annie raised her full brown eyes, glanced at her companions, not one of whom, with the exception of Cecil, returned her gaze fully; then, rising to her feet, she spoke in a slightly contemptuous tone.  \"These preparations seem to me to be much ado about nothing; they take up a lot of our time, and the results aren't worth the trouble--I have nothing particular to say. Oh, well, yes, if you like--let's have blind man's buff and a magic lantern;\" and then, dropping a mock curtsey to her companions, she dropped out of the south parlor.  \"Insufferable girl!\" said Dora Russell; \"I wonder you try to draw her out, Cecil. You know perfectly that we none of us care to have anything to do with her.\"  \"I know perfectly that you are all doing your best to make her life miserable,\" said Cecil, suddenly and boldly. \"No one in this school has obeyed Mrs. Willis' command to treat Annie as innocent--you are practically sending her to Coventry, and I think it is unjust and unfair. You don't know, girls, that you are ruining poor Annie's happiness.\"  \"Oh, dear! she doesn't seem at all dull,\" said Miss West, a second-class girl. \"I do think she's a hardened little wretch.\"  \"Little you know about her,\" said Cecil, the color fading out of her pale face. Then after a pause, she added; \"The injustice of the whole thing is that in this treatment of Annie you break the spirit of Mrs. Willis' command--you, none of you, certainly tell her that she is guilty, but you treat her as such.\"  Here Hester Thornton said a daring thing.  \"I don't believe Mrs. Willis in her heart of hearts considers Annie guiltless.\"  These words of Hester's were laughed at by most of the girls, but Dora Russell gave her an approving nod, and Cecil, looking paler than ever, dropped suddenly into her seat, and no longer tried to defend her absent friend.  \"At any rate,\" said Miss Conway, who as the head girl of the whole school was always listened to with great respect, \"it is unfortunate for the success of our entertainment that there should be all this discussion and bad feeling with regard to Miss Forest. For my own part, I cannot make out why the poor little creature should be hunted down, or what affair it is of ours whether she is innocent or not. If Mr. Everard and Mrs. Willis say she is innocent, is not that enough? The fact of her guilt or innocence can't hurt us one way or another. It is a great pity, however, for our own sakes, that we should be out with her now, for, whatever her faults, she is the only one of us who is ever gifted with an original thought. But, as we can't have her, let us set to work without her--we really can't waste the whole evening over this sort of talk.\"  Discussions as to the coming pleasure were now again resumed with vigor, and after a great deal of animated arguing it was resolved that two short plays should be acted; that a committee should be immediately formed, who should select the plays, and apportion their various parts to the different actors.  The committee selected included Miss Russell, Miss Conway, Hester Thornton, Cecil Temple, and two other girls of the second class. The conference then broke up, but there was a certain sense of flatness over everything, and Cecil was not the only girl who sighed for the merry meetings of last year--when Annie had been the life and soul of all the proceedings, and when one brilliant idea after another with regard to the costumes for the fancy ball had dropped from her merry tongue.     CHAPTER XXI.  STEALING HEARTS.   When Annie ran out of the south parlor she found herself suddenly face to face with Mrs. Willis.  \"Well, my dear child,\" said the head mistress in her kindest voice, \"where are you running to? But I suppose I must not ask; you are, of course, one of the busy and secret conclave in the south parlor?\"  \"No. I have left them,\" said Annie, bending her head, and after her usual habit when agitated, shaking her hair about her face.  \"Left them?\" repeated Mrs. Willis, \"you mean, dear, that they have sent you for some message.\"  \"No. I am not one of them. May I go into the garden, Mrs. Willis?\"  \"Certainly, my dear.\"  Annie did not even glance at her governess. She pushed aside the baize door, and found herself in the great stone hall which led to the play-room and school-room. Her garden hat hung on a peg in the hall, and she tossed it off its place, and holding it in her hand ran toward the side door which opened directly into the garden. She had a wild wish to get to the shelter of the forsaken hammock and there cry out her whole heart. The moment she got into the open air, however, she was met by a whole troop of the little children, who were coming in after their usual short exercise before going to bed. Miss Danesbury was with them, and when Annie ran out by the open door, she entered holding two little ones by the hands. Last in this group toddled Hester's little sister Nan. The moment she saw Annie, her little face broke into smiles, she held out two hands eagerly, and fled to the young girl's side.  \"Where dat pitty toy?\" she said, raising her round face to Annie's; \"some one did buy dat toy, and it's vedy pitty, and me wants it--where's dat toy?\"  Annie stooped down, and spoke suddenly and impulsively to the little child.  \"You shall have the toy for your very own, Nan if you will do something for me?\"  Nan's baby eyes looked straight into Annie's.  \"Me will,\" she said emphatically; \"me want dat toy.\"  \"Put your arms, round me, little darling, and give me a great tight hug.\"  This request was great fun to Nan, who squeezed her little arms round Annie's neck, and pressed her dimpled cheek to her lips.  \"Dere,\" she said triumphantly, \"will dat do?\"  \"Yes, you little treasure, and you'll try to love me, won't you?\"  \"Me do,\" said Nan, in a solemn voice; but then Miss Danesbury called her, and she ran into the house.  As Nan trotted into the house she put up her dimpled hand to wipe something from her round cheek--it was a tear which Annie Forest had left there.  Annie herself, when all the little ones had disappeared, walked slowly and sadly down toward the shady walk. The sun had just set, and though it was now nearly May, and the evenings long, the wind was sufficiently cold to cause Annie to shiver in her thin house frock. At all times utterly fearless with regard to her health, she gave it no thought now, but entering the walk where she knew she should not be disturbed, she looked up at the hammock, and wondered whether she should climb into it. She decided, however, not to do so--the great and terrible weight of tears which had pressed close to her heart were relieved by Nan's embrace; she no longer cared to cry until she could cry no longer--the worst of her pain had been soothed by the sweet baby graciousness of the little one.  Then there darted into poor Annie's sore heart and perplexed brain that dangerous thought and temptation which was to work so much future pain and trouble. She already loved little Nan, and Nan, as most children did, had taken a fancy to her. Annie stood still, and clasped her hands as the dark idea came to her to steal the heart of little Nan from Hester, and so revenge herself on her. By doing this she would touch Hester in her most vulnerable point--she would take from her what she valued most. The temptation came swiftly, and Annie listened to it, and thought how easy it would be to carry it into effect. She knew well that no little child could resist her when she chose to exercise her charms--it would be easy, easy work to make that part of Nan which was most precious all her own. Annie became fascinated by the idea; how completely then she would have revenged all her wrongs on Hester! Some day Hester would bitterly repent of her unjust prejudice toward her; some day Hester would come to her, and beg of her in agony to give her back her darling's love; ah! when that day came it would be her turn to triumph.  She felt more than satisfied as the temptation grew upon her; she shut out persistently from her view all the other side of the picture; she would not let herself think that the work she was about to undertake was cruel and mean. Hester had been more than unjust, and she was going to punish her.  Annie paced faster and faster up and down the shady walk, and whenever her resolution wavered, the memory of Hester's face as she had seen it the same night in the south parlor came visibly back and strengthened it. Yes, her turn had come at last Hester had contrived since her entrance into the school to make Annie's life thoroughly miserable. Well, never mind, it was Annie's turn now to make her wretched.     CHAPTER XXII.  IN BURN CASTLE WOOD.   In concentrating her thoughts of revenge on Hester, Annie ceased to trouble her head about Dora Russell. She considered Hester a crueler enemy than Dora. Hester belonged to her own set, worked in her own class, and would naturally, had things not turned out so unjustly, so unfairly, have been her friend, and not her enemy. Dora had nothing to say to Annie, and before Hester's advent into the school had scarcely noticed her existence. Annie therefore concentrated all her powers on punishing Hester. This gave her an aim and an occupation, and at first she felt that her revenge might give her real pleasure.  Susan Drummond now shared Annie's bedroom, and Annie was rather startled one evening to hear this phlegmatic young person burst out into a strong tirade against Hester and Dora. Dora had managed, for some inexplicable reason, to offend Susan, and Susan now looked to Annie for sympathy, and boldly suggested that they should get up what she was pleased to called \"a lark\" between them for the punishment of this very dignified young lady.  Annie had never liked Susan, and she now stared at her, and said, in her quick way:  \"You won't catch me helping you in any of your larks. I've had trouble enough on that score as it is.\"  Susan gazed at her stupidly, and a dull red spread over her face.  \"But I thought you hated Dora and Hester,\" she said--\"I'm sure they hate you.\"  Annie was silent.  \"You do hate them, don't you?\" persisted Miss Drummond.  \"It's nothing to you what I feel toward them, Susy,\" said Annie. \"Please don't disturb me with any more of your chatter; I am very sleepy, and you are keeping me awake.\"  Thus silenced, Susan had to content herself by turning on her back, and going into the land of dreams; but she was evidently a good deal surprised and disappointed, and began to entertain a certain respect, and even fear, of Annie which had been hitherto unknown to her.  Meanwhile Hester was very busy, very happy, and more satisfied--brighter and better employed than she had ever been in her life before. Nan's love satisfied the affectionate side of her nature, and all her intellect was strained to the utmost to win honors in the coming struggle.  She had stuck firmly to her resolve to work for the English composition prize, and she firmly made up her own mind to leave no stone unturned to win it. What affection she possessed for Miss Russell was not at all of a character to prevent her from thoroughly enjoying taking the prize out of her hands. Her love for Dora had been fed by vanity, and was not at all of a deep or noble character. She was some time carefully choosing the subject of her theme, and at last she resolved to write a brief historical description of the last days of Marie Antoinette. To write properly on this subject she had to read up a great deal, and had to find references in books which were not usually allowed as school-room property. Mrs. Willis, however, always allowed the girls who were working for the English composition prize to have access to her rather extensive library, and here Hester was often to be found during play-hours. Two evenings in the week were also taken up in preparation for the coming plays, and as Hester was to take rather an important part in one, and a small character in another, she was obliged to devote herself to getting up her parts during the weekly half-holidays. Thus every moment was busy, and, except at night, she had little time to devote herself to Nan.  Nan slept in a pretty crib in Hester's room, and each evening the young girl knelt down by her sister's side, and gazed at her with love, which was almost motherly, swelling in her breast.  All that was best of Hester was drawn out at these moments; something greater than ambition--something far and away above school triumphs and school jealousies spoke then in her heart of hearts. These moments found her capable of being both sympathizing and forgiving; these moments followed out in her daily life might have made Hester almost great. Now was the time, with her eyes full of tears and her lips trembling with emotion, for Annie Forest to have caught a glimpse of the divine in Hester; the hardness, the pride, the haughty spirit were all laid aside, and hers was the true child-heart as she knelt by the sleeping baby. Hester prayed earnestly at these moments, and, in in truth, Nan did better for her than any sermon; better for her than even Mrs. Willis' best influences. Nan was as the voice of God to her sister.  Hester, in her very busy life, had no time to notice, however, a very slight and almost imperceptible change in bright little Nan. In the mornings she was in too great a hurry to pay much heed to the little one's chatter; in the afternoons she had scarcely an instant to devote to her, and when she saw her playing happily with the other children she was quite content, and always supposed that when a spare half-hour did come in her busy life, Nan would rush to her with the old ecstasy, and give her the old devotion.  One day, toward the end of a very fine May, the girls were all to go for a picnic to some woods about four miles away. They had looked forward for several days to this relaxation, and were in the highest state of delight and the wildest spirits. After an early dinner they were to drive in several large wagonettes to the place of rendezvous, where they were to be regaled with gypsy-tea, and were to have a few hours in the lovely woods of Burn Castle, one of the show places of the neighborhood. Mrs. Willis had invited the Misses Bruce to accompany them, and they were all to leave the house punctually at two o'clock. The weather was wonderfully fine and warm, and it was decided that all the children, even Nan, should go.  Perhaps none of the girls looked forward to this day's pleasure with greater joy than did Hester; she determined to make it a real holiday, and a real time of relaxation. She would forget her English theme; she would cease to worry herself about Marie Antoinette; she would cease to repeat her part in the coming play; and she would devote herself exclusively and determinately to Nan's pleasure. She pictured the little one's raptures; she heard her gay shouts of joy, her ceaseless little rippling chatter, her baby glee, and, above all things, her intense happiness at being with her own Hetty for the greater part of a whole day. Hester would ride her on her shoulder, would race with her; all her usual companions would be as nothing to her on this occasion, she would give herself up solely to Nan.  As she was dressing that morning she said a word or two to the child about the coming treat.  \"We'll light a fire in the wood, Nan, and hang a kettle over it, and make tea--such good tea; won't it be nice?\"  Nan clapped her hands. \"And may I take out my little ummabella (umbrella), case it might wain?\" she asked anxiously.  Hester flew to her and kissed her.  \"You funny darling!\" she said. \"Oh, we shall have such a day! You'll be with your own Hetty all day long--your own Hetty; won't you be glad?\"  \"Me am,\" said Nan; \"own Hetty, and own Annie; me am glad.\"  Hester scarcely heard the last words, for the prayer-gong sounded, and she had to fly down stairs.  At dinner time the girls were discussing who would go with each, and all were very merry and full of fun.  \"Miss Danesbury will take the little children,\" said Miss Good. \"Mrs. Willis says that all the little ones are to be in Miss Danesbury's charge.\"  \"Oh, please,\" said Hester, suddenly, \"may Nan come with me, Miss Good? She'll be so disappointed if she doesn't, and I'll take such care of her.\"  Miss Good nodded a careless acquiescence, and Hester proceeded with her dinner, feeling thoroughly satisfied.  Immediately after dinner the girls flew to their rooms to prepare for their expedition. Hastily opening a drawer, Hester pulled out a white frock, white piqu pelisse, and washing hat for Nan--she meant her darling to look as charming as possible.  \"Oh, dear, Miss Danesbury should have brought her here by now,\" she said to herself impatiently, and then, hearing the crunching of carriage wheels on the drive, she flew to the bell and rang it.  In a few moments one of the maids appeared.  \"Do you know where Miss Nan is, Alice? She is to go to Burn Castle with me, and I want to dress her, for it is nearly time to go.\"  Alice looked a little surprised.  \"If you please, miss,\" she said, \"I think Miss Nan has just gone.\"  \"What do you mean, Alice? Miss Good said especially she was to go with me.\"  \"I know nothing about that, miss; I only know that I saw Miss Forest carrying her down stairs in her arms about three minutes ago, and they went off in the wagonette with all the other little children and Miss Danesbury.\"  Hester stood perfectly still, her color changed from red to white; for full half a minute she was silent. Then, hearing voices from below calling to her, she said in a cold, quiet tone:  \"That will do, Alice; thank you for letting me know.\"  She turned to her drawer and put back Nan's white and pretty things, and also replaced a new and very becoming shady hat which she had meant to wear herself. In her old winter hat, and looking almost untidy for her, she walked slowly down stairs and took her place in the wagonette which was drawn up at the door.  Cecil Temple and one or two other girls whom Hester liked very much were in the same wagonette, but she scarcely cared to talk to them, and only joined in their laughter by a strong effort. She was deeply wounded, but her keenest present desire was to hide any feelings of jealousy she had toward Annie from the quick eyes of her schoolfellows.  \"Why,\" suddenly exclaimed Julia Morris, a particularly unobservant girl, \"I thought you were going to bring that dear baby sister with you, Hester. Oh, I do hope there is nothing the matter with her.\"  \"Nan has gone on in the first wagonette with the little children,\" said Hester as cheerfully as she could speak, but she colored slightly, and saw that Cecil was regarding her attentively.  Susan Drummond exclaimed suddenly:  \"I saw Annie Forest rushing down the stairs with little Nan, and Nan had her arms round her neck, and was laughing merrily. You need not be anxious about Nan, Hester; she was quite content to go with Annie.\"  \"I did not say I was anxious,\" replied Hester in a cold voice. \"How very beautiful that avenue of beech trees is, Cecil!\"  \"But Annie heard Miss Good say that you were to take Nan,\" persisted Julia Morris. \"She could not but have noticed it, for you did flush up so, Hester, and looked so eager. I never saw any one more in earnest about a trifle in my life; it was impossible for Annie not to have heard.\"  \"The great thing is that Nan is happy,\" said Hester in a fretted voice. \"Do let us change the subject, girls.\"  Cecil instantly began talking about the coming plays, and soon the conversation became of an absorbing character, and Hester's voice was heard oftener than the others, and she laughed more frequently than her companions.  For all this forced merriment, however, Cecil did not fail to observe that when Hester got to the place of meeting at Burn Castle she looked around her with a quick and eager glance. Then the color faded from her face, and her eyes grew dim.  That look of pain on Hester's face was quite enough for kind-hearted Cecil. She had thrown herself on the grass with an exclamation of delight, but in an instant she was on her feet.  \"Now, of course, the first thing is to find little Nan,\" she said; \"she'll be missing you dreadfully, Hetty.\"  Cecil held out her hand to Hester to run with her through the wood, but, to her surprise, Hester drew back.  \"I'm tired,\" she said; \"I daresay we shall find Nan presently. She is sure to be safe, as she is under Miss Danesbury's care.\"  Cecil made no remark, but set off by herself to find the little children. Presently, standing on a little knoll, and putting her two hands round her lips, so as to form a speaking trumpet, she shouted to Hester. Hester came slowly and apparently unwillingly toward her, but when she got to the foot of the knoll, Cecil flew down, and, taking her by the hand, ran with her to the top.  \"Oh, do come quick!\" she exclaimed; \"it is such a pretty sight.\"  Down in the valley about fifty yards away were the ten or twelve little children who formed the infant portion of the school. Miss Danesbury was sitting at some distance off quietly reading, and the children, decked with flowers, and carrying tall grasses and reeds in their hands, were flying round and round in a merry circle, while in their midst, and the center attraction, stood Annie, whose hat was tossed aside, and whose bright, curling hair was literally crowned with wild flowers. On Annie's shoulder stood little Nan, carefully and beautifully poised, and round Nan's wavy curls was a starry wreath of wood-anemones. Nan was shouting gleefully and clapping her hands, while Annie balanced her slightest movement with the greatest agility, and kept her little feet steady on her shoulders with scarcely an effort. As the children ran round and round Annie she waltzed gracefully backward and forward to meet them, and they all sang snatches of nursery rhymes. When Cecil and Hester appeared they had reached in their varied collection:                      \"Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,                     Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.\"  Here Nan exclaimed, in her clear, high-pitched voice:  \"Me no fall, Annie,\" and the small children on the ground clapped their hands and blew kisses to her.  \"Isn't it pretty? Isn't Annie sweet with children?\" said Cecil, looking round to Hester with all the admiration she felt for her friend shining in her face. The expression, however, which Hester wore at that moment really startled Cecil; she was absolutely colorless, and presently she called aloud in a harsh, strained voice:  \"Be careful of her! How wicked of you to put her like that on your shoulder! She will fall--yes, I know she will fall; oh, do be careful!\"  Hester's voice startled the children, who ceased singing and dancing; Annie made a hasty step forward, and one little voice alone kept singing out the words:                    \"Humpty-Dumpty got a great fall!\"--  when there was a crash and a cry, and Nan, in some inexplicable way, had fallen backward from Annie's shoulders.  In one instant Hester was in the midst of the group.  \"Don't touch her,\" she said, as Annie flew to pick up the child, who, falling with some force on her head, had been stunned; \"don't touch her--don't dare! It was your doing; you did it on purpose--you wished to do it!\"  \"You are unjust,\" said Annie, in a low tone. \"Nan was perfectly safe until you startled her. Like all the rest you are unjust. Nan would have come to no harm if you had not spoken.\"  Hester did not vouchsafe another word. She sat on the ground with the unconscious and pretty little flower-crowned figure laid across her lap; she was terrified, and thought in her inexperience that Nan must be dead.  At the first mention of the accident Cecil had flown to fetch some water, and when she and Miss Danesbury applied it to little Nan's temples, she presently sighed, and opened her brown eyes wide.  \"I hope--I trust she is not much hurt,\" said Miss Danesbury; \"but I think it safest to take her home at once. Cecil, dear, can you do anything about fetching a wagonette round to the stile at the entrance of the wood? Now the puzzle is, who is to take care of the rest of the little children? If only they were under Miss Good's care, I should breathe more easily.\"  \"I am going home with Nan,\" said Hester in a hard voice.  \"Of course, my love; no one would think of parting you from your little sister,\" said the governess, soothingly.  \"If you please, Miss Danesbury,\" said Annie, whose face was quite as pale as Hester's, and her eyes heavy as though she longed to cry, \"will you trust me with the little ones? If you do, I will promise to take them straight to Miss Good, and to be most careful of them.\"  Miss Danesbury's gentle and kind face looked relieved.  \"Thank you, Annie--of course I trust you, dear. Take the children at once to the meeting-place under the great oak, and wait there until Miss Good appears.\" Annie suddenly sprang forward, and threw her arms round Miss Danesbury's neck.  \"Miss Danesbury, you comfort me,\" she said, in a kind of stifled voice, and then she ran off with the children.     CHAPTER XXIII.  \"HUMPTY-DUMPTY HAD A GREAT FALL.\"   All the stupor and languor which immediately followed Nan's fall passed off during her drive home; she chatted and laughed, her cheeks were flushed, her eyes bright. Hester turned with a relieved face to Miss Danesbury.  \"My little darling is all right, is she not?\" she said. \"Oh, I was so terrified--oh, how thankful I am no harm has been done!\"  Miss Danesbury did not return Hester's full gaze; she attempted to take little Nan on her knee, but Nan clung to Hetty. Then she said:  \"You must be careful to keep the sun off her, dear--hold your parasol well down--just so. That is better. When we get home, I will put her to bed at once. Please God, there _is_ nothing wrong; but one cannot be too careful.\"  Something in Miss Danesbury's manner affected Hester strangely; she clasped Nan's slight baby form closer and closer to her heart, and no longer joined in the little one's mirth. As the drive drew to a close, Nan again ceased talking, and fell into a heavy sleep.  Miss Danesbury's face grew graver and graver, and, when the wagonette drew up at Lavender House, she insisted on lifting the sleeping child out of Hester's arms, and carrying her up to her little crib. When Nan's little head was laid on the cool pillow, she again opened her eyes, and instantly asked for a drink. Miss Danesbury gave her some milk and water, but the moment she drank it she was sick.  \"Just as I feared,\" said the governess; \"there is some little mischief--not much, I hope--but we must instantly send for the doctor.\"  As Miss Danesbury walked across the room to ring the bell, Hester followed her.  \"She's not in danger?\" she whispered in a hoarse voice. \"If she is, Annie is guilty of murder.\"  \"Don't, my dear,\" said the governess; \"you must keep quiet for Nan's sake. Please God, she will soon be better. All I really apprehend is a little excitement and feverishness, which will pass off in a few days with care. Hester, my dear, I suddenly remember that the house is nearly empty, for all the servants are also enjoying a holiday. I think I must send you for Dr. Mayflower. The wagonette is still at the door. Drive at once to town, my dear, and ask the coachman to take you to No. 10, The Parade. If you are very quick, you will catch Dr. Mayflower before he goes out on his afternoon rounds.\"  Hester glanced for half an instant at Nan, but her eyes were again closed.  \"I will take the best care of her,\" said the governess in a kind voice; \"don't lose an instant, dear.\"  Hester snatched up her hat and flew down stairs. In a moment she was in the wagonette, and the driver was speedily urging his horses in the direction of the small town of Sefton, two miles and a half away. Hester was terrified now--so terrified, in such an agony, that she even forgot Annie; her hatred toward Annie became of secondary importance to her. All her ideas, all her thoughts, were swallowed up in the one great hope--Should she be in time to reach Dr. Mayflower's house before he set off on his afternoon rounds? As the wagonette approached Sefton she buried her face in her hands and uttered a sharp inward cry of agony.  \"Please God, let me find the doctor!\" It was a real prayer from her heart of hearts. The wagonette drew up at the doctor's residence, to discover him stepping into his brougham. Hester was a shy child, and had never seen him before; but she instantly raised her voice, and almost shouted to him:  \"You are to come with me; please, you are to come at once. Little Nan is ill--she is hurt. Please, you are to come at once.\"  \"Eh! young lady?\" said the round-faced doctor \"Oh! I see; you are one of the little girls from Lavender House. Is anything wrong there, dear?\"  Hester managed to relate what had occurred; whereupon the doctor instantly opened the door of the wagonette.  \"Jump out, young lady,\" he said; \"I will drive you back in my brougham. Masters,\" addressing his coachman, \"to Lavender House.\"  Hester sat back in the soft-cushioned carriage, which bowled smoothly along the road. It seemed to her impatience that the pace at which they went was not half quick enough--she longed to put her head out of the window to shout to the coachman to go faster. She felt intensely provoked with the doctor, who sat placidly by her side reading a newspaper.  Presently she saw that his eyes were fixed on her. He spoke in his quietest tones.  \"We always take precisely twenty minutes to drive from the Parade to Lavender House--twenty minutes, neither more or less. We shall be there now in exactly ten minutes.\"  Hester tried to smile, but failed; her agony of apprehension grew and grew. She breathed more freely when they turned into the avenue. When they stopped at the wide stone porch, and the doctor got out, she uttered a sigh of relief. She took Dr. Mayflower herself up to Nan's room. Miss Danesbury opened the door, the doctor went inside, and Hester crouched down on the landing and waited. It seemed to her that the good physician would never come out. When he did she raised a perfectly blanched face to his, she opened her lips, tried to speak, but no words would come. Her agitation was so intense that the kind-hearted doctor took instant pity on her.  \"Come into this room, my child,\" he said. \"My dear, you will be ill yourself if you give way like this. Pooh! pooh! this agitation is extreme--is uncalled for. You have got a shock. I shall prescribe a glass of sherry at once. Come down stairs with me, and I will see that you get one.\"  \"But how is she, sir--how is she?\" poor Hester managed to articulate.  \"Oh! the little one--sweet, pretty, little darling. I did not know she was your sister--a dear little child. She got an ugly fall, though--came on a nasty place.\"  \"But, please, sir, how is she? She--she--she is not in danger?\"  \"Danger? by no means, unless you put her into it. She must be kept very quiet, and, above all things, not excited. I will come to see her again to-morrow morning. With proper care she ought to be quite herself in a few days. Ah! now you've got a little color in your cheek, come down with me and have that glass of sherry, and you will feel all right.\"     CHAPTER XXIV.  ANNIE TO THE RESCUE.   The picnic-party arrived home late. The accident to little Nan had not shortened the day's pleasure, although Mrs. Willis, the moment she heard of it, had come back; for she entered the hall just as the doctor was stepping into his carriage. He gave her his opinion, and said that he trusted no further mischief, beyond a little temporary excitement, had been caused. He again, however, spoke of the great necessity of keeping Nan quiet, and said that her schoolfellows must not come to her, and that she must not be excited in any way. Mrs. Willis came into the great hall where Hester was standing. Instantly she went up to the young girl, and put her arm around and drew her to her side.  \"Darling,\" she said, \"this is a grievous anxiety for you; no words can express my sorrow and my sympathy; but the doctor is quite hopeful, Hester, and, please God, we shall soon have the little one as well as ever.\"  \"You are really sorry for me?\" said Hester, raising her eyes to the head-mistress' face.  \"Of course, dear; need you ask?\"  \"Then you will have that wicked Annie Forest punished--well punished--well punished.\"  \"Sometimes, Hester,\" said Mrs. Willis, very gravely, \"God takes the punishment of our wrongdoings into His own hands. Annie came home with me. Had you seen her face as we drove together you would not have asked _me_ to punish her.\"  \"Unjust, always unjust,\" muttered Hester, but in so low a voice that Mrs. Willis did not hear the words. \"Please may I go to little Nan?\" she said.  \"Certainly, Hester--some tea shall be sent up to you presently.\"  Miss Danesbury arranged to spend that night in Nan's room. A sofa bed was brought in for her to lie on, for Mrs. Willis had yielded to Hester's almost feverish entreaties that she might not be banished from her little sister. Not a sound reached the room where Nan was lying--even the girls took off their shoes as they passed the door--not a whisper came to disturb the sick child. Little Nan slept most of the evening, only sometimes opening her eyes and looking up drowsily when Miss Danesbury changed the cold application to her head. At nine o'clock there came a low tap at the room door. Hester went to open it; one of her schoolfellows stood without.  \"The prayer-gong is not to be sounded to-night. Will you come to the chapel now? Mrs. Willis sent me to ask.\"  Hester shook her head.  \"I cannot,\" she whispered; \"tell her I cannot come.\"  \"Oh, I am so sorry!\" replied the girl; \"is Nan very bad?\"  \"I don't know; I hope not. Good-night.\"  Hester closed the room door, took off her dress, and began very softly to prepare to get into bed. She put on her dressing-gown, and knelt down as usual to her private prayers. When she got on her knees, however, she found it impossible to pray: her brain felt in a whirl, her feelings were unprayer-like; and with the temporary relief of believing Nan in no immediate danger came such a flood of hatred toward Annie as almost frightened her. She tried to ask God to make Nan better--quite well; but even this petition seemed to go no way--to reach no one--to fall flat on the empty air. She rose from her knees, and got quietly into bed.  Nan lay in that half-drowsy and languid state until midnight. Hester, with all her very slight experience of illness, thought that as long as Nan was quiet she must be getting better; but Miss Danesbury was by no means so sure, and, notwithstanding the doctor's verdict, she felt anxious about the child. Hester had said that she could not sleep; but at Miss Danesbury's special request she got into bed, and before she knew anything about it was in a sound slumber. At midnight, when all the house was quiet, and Miss Danesbury kept a lonely watch by the sick child's pillow, there came a marked change for the worse in the little one. She opened her feverish eyes wide and began to call out piteously; but her cry now was, not for Hester, but for Annie.  \"Me want my Annie,\" she said over and over, \"me do, me do. No, no; go 'way, naughty Day-bury, me want my Annie; me do want her.\"  Miss Danesbury felt puzzled and distressed. Hester, however, was awakened by the piteous cry, and sat up in bed.  \"What is it, Miss Danesbury?\" she asked.  \"She is very much excited, Hester; she is calling for Annie Forest.\"  \"Oh, that is quite impossible,\" said Hester, a shudder passing through her. \"Annie can't come here. The doctor specially said that none of the girls were to come near Nan.\"  \"Me want Annie; me want my own Annie,\" wailed the sick child.  \"Give me my dressing-gown, please, Miss Danesbury, and I will go to her,\" said Hester.  She sprang out of bed, and approached the little crib. The brightness of Nan's feverish eyes was distinctly seen. She looked up at Hester, who bent over her; then she uttered a sharp cry and covered her little face.  \"Go 'way, go 'way, naughty Hetty--Nan want Annie; Annie sing, Annie p'ay with Nan--go 'way, go 'way, Hetty.\"  Hester's heart was too full to allow her to speak; but she knelt by the crib and tried to take one of the little hot hands in hers. Nan, however, pushed her hands away, and now began to cry loudly.  \"Annie!--Annie!--Annie! me want 'oo; Nan want 'oo--poor tibby Nan want 'oo, Annie!\"  Miss Danesbury touched Hester on her shoulder.  \"My dear,\" she said, \"the child's wish must be gratified. Annie has an extraordinary power over children, and under the circumstances I shall take it upon me to disobey the doctor's directions. The child must be quieted at all hazards. Run for Annie, dear--you know her room. I had better stay with little Nan, for, though she loves you best, you don't sooth her at present--that is often so with a fever case.\"  \"One moment,\" said Hester. She turned again to the little crib.  \"Hetty is going to fetch Annie for Nan. Will Nan give her own Hetty one kiss?\"  Instantly the little arms were flung round Hester's neck.  \"Me like 'oo now, dood Hetty. Go for Annie, dood Hetty.\"  Instantly Hester ran out of the room. She flew quickly down the long passage, and did not know what a strange little figure she made as the moon from a large window at one end fell full upon her. So eerie, so ghost-like was her appearance as she flew noiselessly with her bare feet along the passage that some one--Hester did not know whom--gave a stifled cry. The cry seemed to come from a good way off, and Hester was too preoccupied to notice it. She darted into the room where Susan Drummond and Annie Forest slept.  \"Annie, you are to come to Nan,\" she said in a sharp high-pitched voice which she scarcely recognized as her own.  \"Coming,\" said Annie, and she walked instantly to the door with her dress on and stood in the moonlight.  \"You are dressed!\" said Hester in astonishment.  \"I could not undress--I lay down as I was. I fancied I heard Nan's voice calling me. I guessed I should be sent for.\"  \"Well, come now,\" said Hester in her hardest tones. \"You were only sent for because Nan must be quieted at any risk. Come and see if you can quiet her. I don't suppose,\" with a bitter laugh \"that you will succeed.\"  \"I think so,\" replied Annie, in a very soft and gentle tone.  She walked back by Hester's side and entered the sick-room. She walked straight up to the little cot and knelt down by Nan, and said, in that strangely melodious voice of hers:  \"Little darling, Annie has come.\"  \"Me like 'oo,\" said Nan with a satisfied coo in her voice, and she turned round on her side with her back to Miss Danesbury and Hester and her eyes fixed on Annie.  \"Sing 'Four-and-twenty,' Annie; sing 'Four-and-twenty,'\" she said presently.  \"Four-and-twenty blackbirds baked in a pie,\" sang Annie in a low clear voice, without a moment's hesitation. She went through the old nursery rhyme once--twice. Then Nan interrupted her fretfully:  \"Me don't want dat 'dain; sing 'Boy Blue,' Annie.\"  Annie sang.  \"'Tree Little Kittens,' Annie,\" interrupted the little voice presently.  For more than two hours Annie knelt by the child, singing nursery rhyme after nursery rhyme, while the bright beautiful eyes were fixed on her face, and the little voice said incessantly:  \"Sing, Annie--sing.\"  \"Baby Bun, now,\" said Nan, when Annie had come almost to the end of her selection.                     \"Bye baby bunting,                    Daddy's gone a hunting--                    He's gone to fetch a rabbit-skin,                    To place the baby bunting in.\"  Over and over and over did Annie sing the words. Whenever, even for a brief moment she paused, Nan said:  \"Sing, Annie--sing 'Baby Bun.'\"  And all the time the eyes remained wide open, and the little hands were burning hot; but, gradually, after more than two hours of constant singing, Annie began to fancy that the burning skin was cooler. Then--could she believe it?--she saw the lids droop over the wide-open eyes. Five minutes later, to the tune of \"Baby Bunting,\" Nan had fallen into a deep and sound sleep.     CHAPTER XXV.  A SPOILED BABY.   In the morning Nan was better, and although for days she was in a very precarious state, and had to be kept as quiet as possible, yet Miss Danesbury's great dread that fever would set in had passed away. The doctor said, however, that Nan had barely escaped real injury to her brain, and that it would be many a day before she would romp again, and play freely and noisily with the other children. Nan had chosen her own nurse, and, with the imperiousness of all babies--to say nothing of sick babies--she had her way. From morning till night Annie remained with her, and when the doctor saw how Annie alone could soothe and satisfy the child he would not allow it to be otherwise. At first Nan would lie with her hand in Annie's, and her little cry of \"sing, Annie,\" going on from time to time; but as she grew better Annie would sit with her by the open window, with her head pillowed on her breast, and her arm round the little slender form, and Nan would smile and look adoringly at Annie, who would often return her gaze with intense sadness, and an indescribable something in her face which caused the little one to stroke her cheek tenderly, and say in her sweet baby voice:  \"Poor Annie; poor tibby Annie!\"  They made a pretty picture as they sat there. Annie, with her charming gypsy face, her wild luxuriant, curly hair, all the sauciness and unrest in her soothed by the magic of the little child's presence; and the little child herself, with her faint, wild-rose color, her dark, deep eyes, clear as summer pools, and her sunshiny golden hair. But pretty as the picture was Hester loathed it, for Hester thought during these wretched days that her heart would break.  Not that Nan turned away from Hetty; she petted her and kissed her, and sometimes put an arm round Hetty and and an arm round Annie, as though, if she could, she would draw them together; but any one could see that her heart of hearts was given to Annie, and that Hester ranked second in her love. Hester would not for worlds express any of her bitter feelings before Annie; nay, as the doctor and Miss Danesbury both declared that, however culpable Annie might have been in causing the accident, she had saved little Nan's life by her wonderful skill in soothing her to sleep on the first night of her illness, Hester had felt obliged to grumble something which might have been taken for \"thanks.\"  Annie, in reply to this grumble, had bestowed upon Hester one of her quickest, brightest glances, for she fathomed the true state of Hester's heart toward her well enough.  These were very bad days for poor Hester, and but for the avidity with which she threw herself into her studies she could scarcely have borne them.  By slow degrees Nan got better; she was allowed to come down stairs and to sit in Annie's arms in the garden, and then Mrs. Willis interfered, and said that Annie must go back to her studies, and only devote her usual play hours and half-holidays to Nan's service.  This mandate, however, produced woe and tribulation. The spoiled child screamed and beat her little hands, and worked herself up into such a pitch of excitement that that night she found her way in her sleep to Annie's room, and Annie had to quiet her by taking her into her bed. In the morning the doctor had to be sent for, and he instantly prescribed a day or two more of Annie's company for the child.  Mrs. Willis felt dreadfully puzzled. She had undertaken the charge of the little one; her father was already far away, so it was impossible now to make any change of plans; the child was ill--had been injured by an accident caused by Annie's carelessness and by Hester's want of self-control. But weak and ill as Nan still was, Mrs. Willis felt that an undue amount of spoiling was good for no one. She thought it highly unjust to Annie to keep her from her school employments at this most important period of the year. If Annie did not reach a certain degree of excellence in her school marks she could not be promoted in her class. Mrs. Willis did not expect the wild and heedless girl to carry off any special prizes; but her abilities were quite up to the average, and she always hoped to rouse sufficient ambition in her to enable her to acquire a good and sound education. Mrs. Willis knew how necessary this was for poor Annie's future, and, after giving the doctor an assurance that Nan's whims and pleasures should be attended to for the next two or three days, she determined at the end of that time to assert her own authority with the child, and to insist on Annie working hard at her lessons, and returning to her usual school-room life.  On the morning of the third day Mrs. Willis made inquiries, heard that Nan had spent an excellent night, eaten a hearty breakfast, and was altogether looking blooming. When the girls assembled in the school-room for their lessons, Annie brought her little charge down to the large play-room, where they established themselves cozily, and Annie began to instruct little Nan in the mysteries of                    \"Tic, tac, too,                   The little horse has lost his shoe.\"  Nan was entering into the spirit of the game, was imagining herself a little horse, and was holding out her small foot to be shod, when Mrs. Willis entered the room.  \"Come with me, Nan,\" she said; \"I have got something to show you.\"  Nan got up instantly, held out one hand to Mrs. Willis and the other to Annie, and said, in her confident baby tones:  \"Me tum; Annie tumming too.\"  Mrs. Willis said nothing, but holding the little hand, and accompanied by Annie, she went out of the play-room, across the stone hall, and through the baize doors until she reached her own delightful private sitting-room.  There were heaps of pretty things about, and Nan gazed round her with the appreciative glance of a pleased connoisseur.  \"Pitty 'oom,\" she said approvingly. \"Nan likes this 'oom. Me'll stay here, and so will Annie.\"  Here she uttered a sudden cry of rapture--on the floor, with its leaves temptingly open, lay a gaily-painted picture-book, and curled up in a soft fluffy ball by its side was a white Persian kitten asleep.  Mrs. Willis whispered something to Annie, who ran out of the room, and Nan knelt down in a perfect rapture of worship by the kitten's side.  \"Pitty tibby pussy!\" she exclaimed several times, and she rubbed it so persistently the wrong way that the kitten shivered and stood up, arched its back very high, yawned, turned round three times, and lay down again, Alas! \"tibby pussy\" was not allowed to have any continuous slumber. Nan dragged the Persian by its tail into her lap, and when it resisted this indignity, and with two or three light bounds disappeared out of the room, she stretched out her little hands and began to cry for it.  \"Tum back, puss, puss--tum back, poor tibby puss--Nan loves 'oo. Annie, go fetch puss for Nan.\" Then for the first time she discovered that Annie was absent, and that she was alone, with the exception of Mrs. Willis, who sat busily writing at a distant table.  Mrs. Willis counted for nothing at all with Nan--she did not consider her of the smallest importance and after giving her a quick glance of some disdain she began to trot round the room on a voyage of discovery. Any moment Annie would come back--Annie had, indeed, probably gone to fetch the kitten, and would quickly return with it. She walked slowly round and round, keeping well away from that part of the room where Mrs. Willis sat. Presently she found a very choice little china jug, which she carefully abstracted with her small fingers from a cabinet, which contained many valuable treasures. She sat down on the floor exactly beneath the cabinet, and began to play with her jug. She went through in eager pantomime a little game which Annie had invented for her, and imagined that she was a little milkmaid, and that the jug was full of sweet new milk; she called out to an imaginary set of purchasers, \"Want any milk?\" and then she poured some by way of drops of milk into the palm of her little hand, which she drank up in the name of her customers with considerable gusto. Presently knocking the little jug with some vehemence on the floor she deprived it with one neat blow of its handle and spout. Mrs. Willis was busily writing, and did not look up. Nan was not in the least disconcerted; she said aloud:  \"Poor tibby zug b'oke,\" and then she left the fragments on the floor, and started off on a fresh voyage of discovery. This time she dragged down a large photographic album on to a cushion, and, kneeling by it, began to look through the pictures, flapping the pages together with a loud noise, and laughing merrily as she did so. She was now much nearer to Mrs. Willis, who was attracted by the sound, and looking up hastened to the rescue of one of her most precious collections of photographs.  \"Nan, dear,\" she said, \"shut up that book at once. Nan mustn't touch. Shut the book, darling, and go and sit on the floor, and look at your nice-colored pictures.\"  Nan, still holding a chubby hand between the leaves of the album, gave Mrs. Willis a full defiant glance, and said:  \"Me won't.\"  \"Come, Nan,\" said the head-mistress.  \"Me want Annie,\" said Nan, still kneeling by the album, and, bending her head over the photographs, she turned the page and burst into a peal of laughter.  \"Pitty bow vow,\" she said, pointing to a photograph of a retriever; \"oh, pitty bow woo, Nan loves 'oo.\"  Mrs. Willis stooped down and lifted the little girl into her arms.  \"Nan, dear,\" she said, \"it is naughty to disobey. Sit down by your picture-book, and be a good girl.\"  \"Me won't,\" said Nan again, and here she raised her small dimpled hand and gave Mrs. Willis a smart slap on her cheek.  \"Naughty lady, me don't like 'oo; go 'way. Nan want Annie--Nan do want Annie. Me don't love 'oo, naughty lady; go 'way.\"  Mrs. Willis took Nan on her knee. She felt that the little will must be bent to hers, but the task was no easy one. The child scarcely knew her, she was still weak and excitable, and she presently burst into storms of tears, and sobbed and sobbed as though her little heart would break, her one cry being for \"Annie, Annie, Annie.\" When Annie did join her in the play hour, the little cheeks were flushed, the white brow ached, and the child's small hands were hot and feverish. Mrs. Willis felt terribly puzzled.     CHAPTER XXVI.  UNDER THE LAUREL BUSH.   Mrs. Willis owned to herself that she was non-plussed; it was quite impossible to allow Annie to neglect her studies, and yet little Nan's health was still too precarious to allow her to run the risk of having the child constantly fretted.  Suddenly a welcome idea occurred to her; she would write at once to Nan's old nurse, and see if she could come to Lavender House for the remainder of the present term. Mrs. Willis dispatched her letter that very day, and by the following evening the nurse was once more in possession of her much-loved little charge. The habits of her babyhood were too strong for Nan; she returned to them gladly enough, and though in her heart of hearts she was still intensely loyal to Annie, she no longer fretted when she was not with her.  Annie resumed her ordinary work, and though Hester was very cold to her, several of the other girls in the school frankly confided to their favorite how much they had missed her, and how glad they were to have her back with them once more.  Annie found herself at this time in an ever-shifting mood--one moment she longed intensely for a kiss, and a fervent pardon from Mrs. Willis' lips; another, she said to herself defiantly she could and would live without it; one moment the hungry and sorrowful look in Hester's eyes went straight to Annie's heart, and she wished she might restore her little treasure whom she had stolen; the next she rejoiced in her strange power over Nan, and resolved to keep all the love she could get.  In short, Annie was in that condition when she could be easily influenced for good or evil--she was in that state of weakness when temptation is least easily resisted.  A few days after the arrival of Nan's nurse Mrs. Willis was obliged unexpectedly to leave home; a near relative was dangerously ill in London, and the school-mistress went away in much trouble and anxiety. Some of her favorite pupils flocked to the front entrance to see their beloved mistress off. Among the group Cecil stood, and several girls of the first class; many of the little girls were also present, but Annie was not among them. Just at the last moment she rushed up breathlessly; she was tying some starry jasmine and some blue forget-me-nots together, and as the carriage was moving off she flung the charming bouquet into her mistress' lap.  Mrs. Willis rewarded her with one of her old looks of confidence and love; she raised the flowers to her lips and kissed them, and her eyes smiled on Annie.  \"Good-by, dear,\" she called out; \"good-by, all my dear girls; I will try and be back to-morrow night. Remember, my children, during my absence I trust you.\"  The carriage disappeared down the avenue, and the group of girls melted away. Cecil looked round for Annie, but Annie had been the first to disappear.  When her mistress had kissed the flowers and smiled at her, Annie darted into the shrubbery and stood there wiping the fast-falling tears from her eyes. She was interrupted in this occupation by the sudden cries of two glad and eager voices, and instantly her hands were taken, and some girls rather younger than herself began to drag her in the opposite direction through the shrubbery.  \"Come; Annie--come at once, Annie, darling,\" exclaimed Phyllis and Nora Raymond. \"The basket has come; it's under the thick laurel-tree in the back avenue. We are all waiting for you; we none of us will open it till you arrive.\"  Annie's face, a truly April one, changed as if by magic. The tears dried on her cheeks; her eyes filled with sunlight; she was all eager for the coming fun.  \"Then we won't lose a moment, Phyllis,\" she said: \"we'll see what that duck of a Betty has done for us.\"  The three girls scampered down the back avenue, where they found five of their companions, among them Susan Drummond, standing in different attitudes of expectation near a very large and low-growing laurel-tree. Every one raised a shout when Annie appeared; she was undoubtedly recognized as queen and leader of the proceedings. She took her post without an instant's hesitation, and began ordering her willing subjects about.  \"Now, is the coast clear? yes, I think so. Come, Susie, greedy as you are, you must take your part. You alone of all of us can cackle with the exact imitation of an old hen: get behind that tree at once and watch the yard. Don't forget to cackle for your life if you even see the shadow of a footfall. Nora, my pretty birdie, you must be the thrush for the nonce; here, take your post, watch the lawn and the front avenue. Now then, girls, the rest of us can see what spoils Betty has provided for us.\"  The basket was dragged from its hiding-place, and longing faces peered eagerly and greedily into its contents.  \"Oh, oh! I say, cherries! and what a lot! Good Betty! dear, darling Betty! you gathered those from your own trees, and they are as ripe as your apple-blossom cheeks! Now then, what next? I do declare, meringues! Betty knew my weakness. Twelve meringues--that is one and a half apiece; Susan Drummond sha'n't have more than her share. Meringues and cheesecakes and--tartlets--oh! oh! what a duck Betty is! A plum-cake--good, excellent Betty, she deserves to be canonized! What have we here? Roast chickens--better and better! What is in this parcel? Slices of ham; Betty knew she dare not show her face again if she forgot the ham. Knives and forks, spoons--fresh rolls--salt and pepper, and a dozen bottles of ginger-beer, and a little corkscrew in case we want it.\"  These various exclamations came from many lips. The contents of the basket were carefully and tenderly replaced, the lid was fastened down, and it was once more consigned to its hiding place under the thick boughs of the laurel.  Not a moment too soon, for just at this instant Susan cackled fiercely, and the little group withdrew, Annie first whispering:  \"At twelve to-night, then, girls--oh, yes, I have managed the key.\"     CHAPTER XXVII.  TRUANTS.   It was a proverbial saying in the school that Annie Forest was always in hot water; she was exceedingly daring, and loved what she called a spice of danger. This was not the first stolen picnic at which Annie reigned as queen, but this was the largest she had yet organized, and this was the first time she had dared to go out of doors with her satellites.  Hitherto these naughty sprites had been content to carry their baskets full of artfully-concealed provisions to a disused attic which was exactly over the box-room, and consequently out of reach of the inhabited part of the house. Here, making a table of a great chest which stood in the attic, they feasted gloriously, undisturbed by the musty smell or by the innumerable spiders and beetles which disappeared rapidly in all directions at their approach; but when Annie one day incautiously suggested that on summer nights the outside world was all at their disposal, they began to discover flaws in their banqueting hall. Mary Price said the musty smell made her half sick; Phyllis declared that at the sight of a spider she invariably turned faint; and Susan Drummond was heard to murmur that in a dusty, fusty attic even meringues scarcely kept her awake. The girls were all wild to try a midnight picnic out of doors, and Annie in her present mood, was only too eager for the fun.  With her usual skill she organized the whole undertaking, and eight agitated, slightly frightened, but much excited girls retired to their rooms that night. Annie, in her heart of hearts, felt rather sorry that Mrs. Willis should happen to be away; dim ideas of honor and trustworthiness were still stirring in her breast, but she dared not think now.  The night was in every respect propitious; the moon would not rise until after twelve, so the little party could get away under the friendly shelter of the darkness, and soon afterward have plenty of light to enjoy their stolen feast. They had arranged to make no movement until close on midnight, and then they were all to meet in a passage which belonged to the kitchen regions, and where there was a side door which opened directly into the shrubbery. This door was not very often unlocked, and Annie had taken the key from its place in the lock some days before. She went to bed with her companions at nine o'clock as usual, and presently fell into an uneasy doze. She awoke to hear the great clock in the hall strike eleven, and a few minutes afterward she heard Miss Danesbury's footsteps retiring to her room at the other end of the passage.  \"Danesbury is always the last to go to bed,\" whispered Annie to herself; \"I can get up presently.\"  She lay for another twenty minutes, then, softly rising, began to put on her clothes in the dark. Over her dress she fastened her waterproof, and placed a close-fitting brown velvet cap on her curly head. Having dressed herself, she approached Susan's bed, with the intention of rousing her.  \"I shall have fine work now,\" she said, \"and shall probably have to resort to cold water. Really, if Susy proves too hard to wake, I shall let her sleep on--her drowsiness is past bearing.\"  Annie, however, was considerably startled when she discovered that Miss Drummond's bed was without an occupant.  At this moment the room door was very softly opened, and Susan, fully dressed and in her waterproof, came in.  \"Why, Susy, where have you been?\" exclaimed Annie. \"Fancy you being awake a moment before it is necessary!\"  \"For once in a way I was restless,\" replied Miss Drummond, \"so I thought I would get up, and take a turn in the passage outside. The house is perfectly quiet, and we can come now; most of the girls are already waiting at the side door.\"  Holding their shoes in their hands, Annie and Susan went noiselessly down the carpetless stairs, and found the remaining six girls waiting for them by the side door.  \"Rover is our one last danger now,\" said Annie, as she fitted the well-oiled key into the lock. \"Put on your shoes, girls, and let me out first; I think I can manage him.\"  She was alluding to a great mastiff which was usually kept chained up by day. Phyllis and Nora laid their hands on her arm.  \"Oh, Annie, oh love, suppose he seizes on you, and knocks you down--oh, dare you venture?\"  \"Let me go,\" said Annie a little contemptuously; \"you don't suppose I am afraid?\"  Her fingers trembled, for her nerves were highly strung; but she managed to unlock the door and draw back the bolts, and, opening it softly, she went out into the silent night.  Very slight as the noise she made was, it had aroused the watchful Rover, who trotted around swiftly to know what was the matter. But Annie had made friends with Rover long ago, by stealing to his kennel door and feeding him, and she had now but to say \"Rover\" in her melodious voice, and throw her arms around his neck, to completely subvert his morals.  \"He is one of us, girls,\" she called in a whisper to her companions; \"come out. Rover will be as naughty as the rest of us, and go with us as our body-guard to the fairies' field. Now, I will lock the door on the outside, and we can be off. Ah, the moon is getting up splendidly, and when we have secured Betty's basket, we shall be quite out of reach of danger.\"  At Annie's words of encouragement the seven girls ventured out. She locked the door, put the key into her pocket, and, holding Rover by his collar, led the way in the direction of the laurel-bush. The basket was secured, and Susan, to her disgust, and Mary Morris were elected for the first part of the way to carry it. The young truants then walked quickly down the avenue until they came to a turnstile which led into a wood.     CHAPTER XXVIII.  IN THE FAIRIES' FIELD.   The moon had now come up brilliantly, and the little party were in the highest possible spirits. They had got safely away from the house, and there was now, comparatively speaking, little fear of discovery. The more timid ones, who ventured to confess that their hearts were in their mouths while Annie was unlocking the side door, now became the most excited, and perhaps the boldest, under the reaction which set in. Even the wood, which was comparatively dark, with only patches of moonlight here and there, and queer weird shadows where the trees were thinnest, could not affect their spirits.  The poor sleepy rabbits must have been astonished that night at the shouts of the revelers, as they hurried past them, and the birds must have taken their sleepy heads from under their downy wings, and wondered if the morning had come some hours before its usual time.  More than one solemn old owl blinked at them, and hooted as they passed, and told them in owl language what silly, naughty young things they were, and how they would repent of this dissipation by-and-by. But if the girls were to have an hour of remorse, it did not visit them then; their hearts were like feathers, and by the time they reached the fields where the fairies were supposed to play, their spirits had become almost uncontrollable.  Luckily for them this small green field lay in a secluded hollow, and more luckily for them no tramps were about to hear their merriment. Rover, who constituted himself Annie's protector, now lay down by her side, and as she was the real ringleader and queen of the occasion, she ordered her subjects about pretty sharply.  \"Now, girls, quick; open the basket. Yes, I'm going to rest. I have organized the whole thing, and I'm fairly tired; so I'll just sit quietly here, and Rover will take care of me while you set things straight. Ah! good Betty; she did not even forget the white table-cloth.\"  Here one of the girls remarked casually that the grass was wet with dew, and that it was well they had all put on their waterproofs.  Annie interrupted again in a petulant voice:  \"Don't croak, Mary Morris. Out with the chickens, lay the ham in this corner, and the cherries will make a picturesque pile in the middle. Twelve meringues in all; that means a meringue and a half each. We shall have some difficulty in dividing. Oh, dear! oh, dear! how hungry I am! I was far too excited to eat anything at supper-time.\"  \"So was I,\" said Phyllis, coming up and pressing close to Annie. \"I do think Miss Danesbury cuts the bread and butter too thick--don't you, Annie? I could not eat mine at all to-night, and Cecil Temple asked me if I was not well.\"  \"Those who don't want chicken hold up their hands,\" here interrupted Annie, who had tossed her brown cap on the grass, and between whose brows a faint frown had passed for an instant at the mention of Cecil's name.  The feast now began in earnest and silence reigned for a short time, broken only by the clatter of plates and such an occasional remark as \"Pass the salt, please,\" \"Pepper this way, if you've no objection,\" \"How good chicken tastes in fairy-land,\" etc. At last the ginger-beer bottles began to pop--the girls' first hunger was appeased. Rover gladly crunched up all the bones, and conversation flowed once more, accompanied by the delicate diversion of taking alternate bites at meringues and cheesecakes.  \"I wish the fairies would come out,\" said Annie.  \"Oh, don't!\" shivered Phyllis, looking round her nervously.  \"Annie darling, do tell us a ghost story,\" cried several voices.  Annie laughed and commenced a series of nonsense tales, all of a slightly eerie character, which she made up on the spot.  The moon riding high in the heavens looked down on the young giddy heads, and their laughter, naughty as they were, sounded sweet in the night air.  Time flew quickly and the girls suddenly discovered that they must pack up their table-cloth and remove all traces of the feast unless they wished the bright light of morning to discover them. They rose hastily, sighing and slightly depressed now that their fun was over. The white table-cloth, no longer very white, was packed into the basket, the ginger-beer bottles placed on top of it and the lid fastened down. Not a crumb of the feast remained; Rover had demolished the bones and the eight girls had made short work of everything else, with the exception of the cherry-stones, which Phyllis carefully collected and popped into a little hole in the ground.  The party then progressed slowly homeward and once more entered the dark wood. They were much more silent now; the wood was darker, and the chill which foretells the dawn was making itself felt in the air. Either the sense of cold or a certain effect produced by Annie's ridiculous stories, made many of the little party unduly nervous.  They had only taken a few steps through the wood when Phyllis suddenly uttered a piercing shriek. This shriek was echoed by Nora and by Mary Morris, and all their hearts seemed to leap into their mouths when they saw something move among the trees. Rover uttered a growl, and, but for Annie's detaining hand, would have sprung forward. The high-spirited girl was not to be easily daunted.  \"Behold, girls, the goblin of the woods,\" she exclaimed. \"Quiet, Rover; stand still.\"  The next instant the fears of the little party reached their culmination when a tall, dark figure stood directly in their paths.  \"If you don't let us pass at once,\" said Annie's voice, \"I'll set Rover at you.\"  The dog began to bark loudly and quivered from head to foot.  The figure moved a little to one side, and a rather deep and slightly dramatic voice said:  \"I mean you no harm, young ladies; I'm only a gypsy-mother from the tents yonder. You are welcome to get back to Lavender House. I have then one course plain before me.\"  \"Come on, girls,\" said Annie, now considerably frightened, while Phyllis, and Nora, and one or two more began to sob.  \"Look here, young ladies,\" said the gypsy in a whining voice, \"I don't mean you no harm, my pretties, and it's no affair of mine telling the good ladies at Lavender House what I've seen. You cross my hand, dears, each of you, with a bit of silver, and all I'll do is to tell your pretty fortunes, and mum is the word with the gypsy-mother as far as this night's prank is concerned.\"  \"We had better do it, Annie--we had better do it,\" here sobbed Phyllis. \"If this was found out by Mrs. Willis we might be expelled--we might, indeed; and that horrid woman is sure to tell of us--I know she is.\"  \"Quite sure to tell, dear,\" said the tall gypsy, dropping a courtesy in a manner which looked frightfully sarcastic in the long shadows made by the trees. \"Quite sure to tell, and to be expelled is the very least that could happen to such naughty little ladies. Here's a nice little bit of clearing in the wood, and we'll all come over, and Mother Rachel will tell your fortunes in a twinkling, and no one will be the wiser. Sixpence apiece, my dears--only sixpence apiece.\"  \"Oh, come; do, do come,\" said Nora, and the next moment they were all standing in a circle round Mother Rachel, who pocketed her blackmail eagerly, and repeated some gibberish over each little hand. Over Annie's palm she lingered for a brief moment, and looked with her penetrating eyes into the girl's face.  \"You'll have suffering before you, miss; some suspicion, and danger even to life itself. But you'll triumph, my dear, you'll triumph. You're a plucky one, and you'll do a brave deed. There--good-night, young ladies; you have nothing more to fear from Mother Rachel.\"  The tall dark figure disappeared into the blackest shadows of the wood, and the girls, now like so many frightened hares, flew home. They deposited their basket where Betty would find it, under the shadow of the great laurel in the back avenue. They all bade Rover an affectionate \"good-night.\" Annie softly unlocked the side-door, and one by one, with their shoes in their hands, they regained their bedrooms. They were all very tired, and very cold, and a dull fear and sense of insecurity rested over each little heart. Suppose Mother Rachel proved unfaithful, notwithstanding the sixpences?     CHAPTER XXIX.  HESTER'S FORGOTTEN BOOK.   It wanted scarcely three weeks to the holidays, and therefore scarcely three weeks to that auspicious day when Lavender House was to be the scene of one long triumph, and was to be the happy spot selected for a midsummer holiday, accompanied by all that could make a holiday perfect--for youth and health would be there, and even the unsuccessful competitors for the great prizes would not have too sore hearts, for they would know that on the next day they were going home. Each girl who had done her best would have a word of commendation, and only those who were very naughty, or very stubborn, could resist the all-potent elixir of happiness which would be poured out so abundantly for Mrs. Willis' pupils on this day.  Now that the time was drawing so near, those girls who were working for prizes found themselves fully occupied from morning to night. In play-hours even, girls would be seen with their heads bent over their books, and, between the prizes and the acting, no little bees in any hive could be more constantly employed than were these young girls just now.  No happiness is, after all, to be compared to the happiness of healthful occupation. Busy people have no time to fret and no time to grumble. According to our old friend, Dr. Watts, people who are healthily busy have also no time to be naughty, for the old doctor says that it is for idle hands that mischief is prepared.  Be that as it may, and there is great truth in it, some naughty sprites, some bad fairies, were flitting around and about that apparently peaceful atmosphere. That sunny home, governed by all that was sweet and good, was not without its serpent.  Of all the prizes which attracted interest and aroused competition, the prize for English composition was this year the most popular. In the first place, this was known to be Mrs. Willis' own favorite subject. She had a great wish that her girls should write intelligibly--she had a greater wish that, if possible, they should think.  \"Never was there so much written and printed,\" she was often heard to say; \"but can any one show me a book with thoughts in it? Can any one show me, unless as a rare exception, a book which will live? Oh, yes, these books which issue from the press in thousands are, many of them, very smart, a great many of them clever, but they are thrown off too quickly. All great things, great books among them, must be evolved slowly.\"  Then she would tell her pupils what she considered the reason of this.  \"In these days,\" she would say, \"all girls are what is called highly educated. Girls and boys alike must go in for competitive examinations, must take out diplomas, and must pass certain standards of excellence. The system is cramming from beginning to end. There is no time for reflection. In short, my dear girls, you swallow a great deal, but you do not digest your intellectual food.\"  Mrs. Willis hailed with pleasure any little dawnings of real thought in her girls' prize essays. More than once she bestowed the prize upon the essay which seemed to the girls the most crude and unfinished.  \"Never mind,\" she would say, \"here is an idea--or at least half an idea. This little bit of composition is original, and not, at best, a poor imitation of Sir. Walter Scott or Lord Macaulay.\"  Thus the girls found a strong stimulus to be their real selves in these little essays, and the best of them chose their subject and let it ferment in their brains without the aid of books, except for the more technical parts.  More than one girl in the school was surprised at Dora Russell exerting herself to try for the prize essay. She was just about to close her school career, and they could not make out why she roused herself to work for the most difficult prize, for which she would have to compete with any girl in the school who chose to make a similar attempt.  Dora, however, had her own, not very high motive for making the attempt. She was a thoroughly accomplished girl, graceful in her appearance and manner; in short, just the sort of girl who would be supposed to do credit to a school. She played with finish, and even delicacy of touch. There was certainly no soul in her music, but neither were there any wrong notes. Her drawings were equally correct, her perspective good, her trees were real trees, and the coloring of her water-color sketches was pure. She spoke French extremely well, and with a correct accent, and her German also was above the average. Nevertheless, Dora was commonplace, and those girls who knew her best spoke sarcastically, and smiled at one another when she alluded to her prize essay, and seemed confident of being the successful competitor.  \"You won't like to be beaten, Dora, say, by Annie Forest,\" they would laughingly remark; whereupon Dora's calm face, would slightly flush and her lips would assume a very proud curve. If there was one thing she could not bear it was to be beaten.  \"Why do you try for it, Dora?\" her class-fellows would ask; but here Dora made no reply: she kept her reason to herself.  The fact was, Dora, who must be a copyist to the end of the chapter, and who could never to her latest day do anything original, had determined to try for the composition prize because she happened accidentally to hear a conversation between Mrs. Willis and Miss Danesbury, in which something was said about a gold locket with Mrs. Willis' portrait inside.  Dora instantly jumped at the conclusion that this was to be the great prize bestowed upon the successful essayist. Delightful idea; how well the trinket would look round her smooth white throat! Instantly she determined to try for this prize, and of course as instantly the bare idea of defeat became intolerable to her. She went steadily and methodically to work. With extreme care she chose her subject. Knowing something of Mrs. Willis' peculiarities, she determined that her theme should not be historical; she believed that she could express herself freely and with power if only she could secure an unhackneyed subject. Suddenly an idea which she considered brilliant occurred to her. She would call her composition \"The River.\" This should not bear reference to Father Thames, or any other special river of England, but it should trace the windings of some fabled stream of Dora's imagination, which, as it flowed along, should tell something of the story of the many places by which it passed. Dora was charmed with her own thought, and worked hard, evening after evening, at her subject, covering sheets of manuscript paper with penciled jottings, and arranging and rearranging her somewhat confused thoughts. She greatly admired a perfectly rounded period, and she was most particular as to the style in which she wrote. For the purpose of improving her style she even studied old volumes of Addison's _Spectator_; but after a time she gave up this course of study, for she found it so difficult to mold her English to Addison's that she came to the comfortable conclusion that Addison was decidedly obsolete, and that if she wished to do full justice to \"The River\" she must trust to her own unaided genius.  At last the first ten pages were written. The subject was entered upon with considerable flourishes, and some rather apt poetical quotations from a book containing a collection of poems; the river itself had already left its home in the mountain, and was careering merrily past sunny meadows and little rural, impossible cottages, where the golden-haired children played.  Dora made a very neat copy of her essay so far. She now began to see her way clearly--there would be a very powerful passage as the river approached the murky town. Here, indeed, would be room for powerful and pathetic writing. She wondered if she might venture so far as to hide a suicide in her rushing waters; and then at last the brawling river would lose itself in the sea; and, of course, there would not be the smallest connection between her river, and Kingsley's well-known song,                             \"Clear and cool.\"  She finished writing her ten pages, and being now positively certain of her gold locket, went to bed in a happy state of mind.  This was the very night when Annie was to lead her revelers through the dark wood, but Dora, who never troubled herself about the younger classes, would have been certainly the last to notice the fact that a few of the girls in Lavender House seemed little disposed to eat their suppers of thick bread and butter and milk. She went to bed and dreamed happy dreams about her golden locket, and had little idea that any mischief was about to be performed.  Hester Thornton also, but in a very different spirit, was working hard at her essay. Hester worked conscientiously; she had chosen \"Marie Antoinette\" as her theme, and she read the sorrowful story of the beautiful queen with intense interest, and tried hard to get herself into the spirit of the times about which she must write. She had scarcely begun her essay yet, but she had already collected most of the historical facts.  Hester was a very careful little student, and as she prepared herself for the great work, she thought little or nothing about the prize--she only wanted to do justice to the unfortunate queen of France. She was in bed that night, and just dropping off to sleep, when she suddenly remembered that she had left a volume of French poetry on her school desk. This was against the rules, and she knew that Miss Danesbury would confiscate the book in the morning, and would not let her have it back for a week. Hester particularly wanted this special book just now, as some of the verses bore reference to her subject, and she could scarcely get on with her essay without having it to refer to. She must lose no time in instantly beginning to write her essay, and to do without her book of poetry for a week would be a serious injury to her.  She resolved, therefore, to break through one of the rules, and, after lying awake until the whole house was quiet, to slip down stairs, enter the school-room and secure her poems. She heard the clock strike eleven, and she knew that in a very few moments Miss Danesbury and Miss Good would have retired to their rooms. Ah, yes, that was Miss Danesbury's step passing her door. Ten minutes later she glided out of bed, slipped on her dressing-gown, and opening her door ran swiftly down the carpetless stairs, and found herself in the great stone hall which led to the school-room.  She was surprised to find the school-room door a little ajar, but she entered the room without hesitation, and, dark as it was, soon found her desk, and the book of poems lying on the top. Hester was about to return when she was startled by a little noise in that portion of the room where the first class girls sat. The next moment somebody came heavily and rather clumsily down the room, and the moon, which was just beginning to rise, fell for an instant on a girl's face. Hester recognized the face of Susan Drummond. What could she be doing here? She did not dare to speak, for she herself had broken a rule in visiting the school-room. She remained, therefore, perfectly still until Susan's steps died away, and then, thankful to have secured her own property, returned to her bedroom, and a moment or two later was sound asleep.     CHAPTER XXX.  \"A MUDDY STREAM.\"   In the morning Dora Russell sat down as usual before her orderly and neatly-kept desk. She raised the lid to find everything in its place--her books and exercises all as they should be, and her pet essay in a neat brown paper cover, lying just as she had left it the night before. She was really getting quite excited about her river, and as this was a half-holiday, she determined to have a good work at it in the afternoon. She was beginning also to experience that longing for an auditor which occasionally is known to trouble the breasts of genius. She felt that those graceful ideas, that elegant language, those measured periods, might strike happily on some other ears before they were read aloud as the great work of the midsummer holidays.  She knew that Hester Thornton was making what she was pleased to term a poor little attempt at trying for the same prize. Hester would scarcely venture to copy anything from Dora's essay; she would probably be discouraged, poor girl, in working any longer at her own composition; but Dora felt that the temptation to read \"The River,\" as far as it had gone, to Hester was really too great to be resisted. Accordingly, after dinner she graciously invited Hester to accompany her to a bower in the garden, where the two friends might revel over the results of Dora's extraordinary talents.  Hester was still, to a certain extent, under Dora's influence, and had not the courage to tell her that she intended to be very busy over her own essay this afternoon.  \"Now, Hester, dear,\" said Dora, when they found themselves both seated in the bower, \"you are the only girl in the school to whom I could confide the subject of my great essay. I really believe that I have hit on something absolutely original. My dear child, I hope you won't allow yourself to be discouraged. I fear that you won't have much heart to go on with your theme after you have read my words; but, never mind, dear, it will be good practice for you, and you know it _was_ rather silly to go in for a prize which I intended to compete for.\"  \"May I read your essay, please, Dora?\" asked Hester. \"I am very much interested in my own study, and, whether I win the prize or not, I shall always remember the pleasure I took in writing it.\"  \"What subject did you select, dear?\" inquired Miss Russell.  \"Well, I am attempting a little sketch of Marie Antoinette.\"  \"Ah, hackneyed, my dear girl--terribly hackneyed; but, of course, I don't mean to discourage you. _Now I_--I draw a life-picture, and I call it 'The River.' See how it begins--why, I declare I know the words by heart, '_As our eyes rest on this clear and limpid stream, as we see the sun sparkle_----' My dear Hester, you shall read me my essay aloud. I shall like to hear my own words from your lips, and you have really a pretty accent, dear.\"  Hester folded back the brown paper cover, and wanting to have her task over began to read hastily. But, as her eyes rested on the first lines, she turned to her companion, and said:  \"Did you not tell me that your essay was called 'The River'?\"  \"Yes, dear; the full title is 'The Windings of a Noble River.'\"  \"That's very odd,\" replied Hester. \"What I see here is 'The Meanderings of a Muddy Stream.' '_As our dull orbs rest on this turbid water on which the sun cannot possibly shine._' Why, Dora, this cannot be your essay, and yet, surely, it is your handwriting.\"  Dora, with her face suddenly flushing a vivid crimson, snatched the manuscript from Hester's hand, and looked over it eagerly. Alas! there was no doubt. The title of this essay was \"The Meanderings of a Muddy Stream,\" and the words which immediately followed were a smart and ridiculous parody on her own high flown sentences. The resemblance to her handwriting was perfect. The brown paper cover, neatly sewn on to protect the white manuscript, was undoubtedly her cover; the very paper on which the words were written seemed in all particulars the same. Dora turned the sheets eagerly, and here for the first time she saw a difference. Only four or five pages of the nonsense essay had been attempted, and the night before, when finishing her toil, she had proudly numbered her tenth page. She looked through the whole thing, turning leaf after leaf, while her cheeks were crimson, and her hands trembled. In the first moment of horrible humiliation and dismay she literally could not speak.  At last, springing to her feet, and confronting the astonished and almost frightened Hester, she found her voice.  \"Hester, you must help me in this. The most dreadful, the most atrocious fraud has been committed. Some one has been base enough, audacious enough, wicked enough, to go to my desk privately, and take away my real essay--my work over which I have labored and toiled. The expressions of my--my--yes, I will say it--my genius, have been ruthlessly burned, or otherwise made away with, and _this_ thing has been put in their place. Hester, why don't you speak--why do you stare at me like this?\"  \"I am puzzled by the writing,\" said Hester; \"the writing is yours.\"  \"The writing is mine!--oh, you wicked girl! The writing is an imitation of mine--a feeble and poor imitation. I thought, Hester, that by this time you knew your friend's handwriting. I thought that one in whom I have confided--one whom I have stooped to notice because, I fancied we had a community of soul, would not be so ridiculous and so silly as to mistake this writing for mine. Look again, please, Hester Thornton, and tell me if I am ever so vulgar as to cross my _t's_. You know I _always_ loop them; and do I make a capital B in this fashion? And do I indulge in flourishes? I grant you that the general effect to a casual observer would be something the same, but you, Hester--I thought you knew me better.\"  Here Hester, examining the false essay, had to confess that the crossed _t's_ and the flourishes were unlike Miss Russell's calligraphy.  \"It is a forgery, most cleverly done,\" said Dora. \"There is such a thing, Hester, as being wickedly clever. This spiteful, cruel attempt to injure another can have but proceeded from one very low order of mind. Hester, there has been plenty of favoritism in this school, but do you suppose I shall allow such a thing as this to pass over unsearched into? If necessary, I shall ask my father to interfere. This is a slight--an outrage; but the whole mystery shall at last be cleared up. Miss Good and Miss Danesbury shall be informed at once, and the very instant Mrs. Willis returns she shall be told what a serpent she has been nursing in this false, wicked girl, Annie Forest.\"  \"Stop, Dora,\" said Hester suddenly. She sprang to her feet, clasping her hands, and her color varied rapidly from white to red. A sudden light poured in upon her, and she was about to speak when something--quite a small, trivial thing--occurred. She only saw little Nan in the distance flying swiftly, with outstretched arms, to meet a girl, whose knees she clasped in baby ecstasy. The girl stooped down and kissed the little face, and the round arms were flung around her neck. The next instant Annie Forest continued her walk alone, and Nan, looking wistfully back after her, went in another direction with her nurse. The whole scene took but a moment to enact, but as she watched, Hester's face grew hard and white. She sat down again, with her lips firmly pressed together.  \"What is it, Hester?\" exclaimed Dora. \"What were you going to say? You surely know nothing about this?\"  \"Well, Dora, I am not the guilty person. I was only going to remark that you cannot be _sure_ it is Annie Forest.\"  \"Oh, so you are going to take that horrid girl's part now? I wonder at you! She all but killed your little sister, and then stole her love away from you. Did you see the little thing now, how she flew to her? Why, she never kisses you like that.\"  \"I know--I know,\" said Hester, and she turned away her face with a groan, and leaned forward against the rustic bench, pressing her hot forehead down on her hands.  \"You'll have your triumph, Hester, when Miss Forest is publicly expelled,\" said Dora, tapping her lightly on the shoulder, and then, taking up the forged essay, she went slowly out of the garden.     CHAPTER XXXI.  GOOD AND BAD ANGELS.   Hester stayed behind in the shady little arbor, and then, on that soft spring day, while the birds sang overhead, and the warm light breezes came in and fanned her hot cheeks, good angels and bad drew near to fight for a victory. Which would conquer? Hester had many faults, but hitherto she had been honorable and truthful; her sins had been those of pride and jealousy, but she had never told a falsehood in her life. She knew perfectly--she trembled as the full knowledge overpowered her--that she had it in her power to exonerate Annie. She could not in the least imagine how stupid Susan Drummond could contrive and carry out such a clever and deep-laid plot; but she knew also that if she related what she had seen with her own eyes the night before, she would probably give such a clue to the apparent mystery that the truth would come to light.  If Annie was cleared from this accusation, doubtless the old story of her supposed guilt with regard to Mrs. Willis' caricature would also be read with its right key. Hester was a clever and sharp girl; and the fact of seeing Susan Drummond in the school-room in the dead of night opened her eyes also to one or two other apparent little mysteries. While Susan was her own room-mate she had often given a passing wonder to the fact of her extraordinary desire to overcome her sleepiness, and had laughed over the expedients Susan had used to wake at all moments.  These things, at the time, had scarcely given her a moment's serious reflection; but now she pondered them carefully, and became more and more certain, that, for some inexplicable and unfathomable reason sleepy, and apparently innocent, Susan Drummond wished to sow the seeds of mischief and discord in the school. Hester was sure that if she chose to speak now she could clear poor Annie, and restore her to her lost place in Mrs. Willis' favor.  Should she do so? ah! should she? Her lips trembled, her color came and went as the angels, good and bad, fought hard for victory within her. How she had longed to revenge herself on Annie! How cordially she had hated her! Now was the moment of her revenge. She had but to remain silent now, and to let matters take their course; she had but to hold her tongue about the little incident of last night, and, without any doubt, circumstantial evidence would point at Annie Forest, and she would be expelled from the school. Mrs. Willis must condemn her now. Mr. Everard must pronounce her guilty now. She would go, and when the coast was again clear the love which she had taken from Hester--the precious love of Hester's only little sister--would return.  \"You will be miserable; you will be miserable,\" whispered the good angels sorrowfully in her ear; but she did not listen to them.  \"I said I would revenge myself, and this is my opportunity,\" she murmured. \"Silence--just simply silence--will be my revenge.\"  Then the good angels went sorrowfully back to their Father in heaven, and the wicked angels rejoiced. Hester had fallen very low.     CHAPTER XXXII.  FRESH SUSPICIONS.   Mrs. Willis was not at home many hours before Dora Russell begged for an interview with her. Annie had not as yet heard anything of the changed essay; for Dora had resolved to keep the thing a secret until Mrs. Willis herself took the matter in hand.  Annie was feeling not a little anxious and depressed. She was sorry now that she had led the girls that wild escapade through the wood. Phyllis and Nora were both suffering from heavy colds in consequence, and Susan Drummond was looking more pasty about her complexion, and was more dismally sleepy than usual. Annie was going through her usual season of intense remorse after one of her wild pranks. No one repented with more apparent fervor than she did, and yet no one so easily succumbed to the next temptation. Had Annie been alone in the matter she would have gone straight to Mrs. Willis and confessed all; but she could not do this without implicating her companions, who would have screamed with horror at the very suggestion.  All the girls were more or less depressed by the knowledge that the gypsy woman, Mother Rachel, shared their secret; and they often whispered together as to the chances of her betraying them. Old Betty they could trust; for Betty, the cake-woman, had been an arch-conspirator with the naughty girls of Lavender House from time immemorial. Betty had always managed to provide their stolen suppers for them, and had been most accommodating in the matter of pay. Yes, with Betty they felt they were safe; but Mother Rachel was a different person. She might like to be paid a few more sixpences for her silence; she might hover about the grounds; she might be noticed. At any moment she might boldly demand an interview with Mrs. Willis.  \"I'm awfully afraid of Mother Rachel,\" Phyllis moaned, as she shivered under the influence of her bad cold.  Nora said \"I should faint if I saw her again, I know I should;\" while the other girls always went out provided with stray sixpences, in case the gypsy mother should start up from some unexpected quarter and demand blackmail.  On the day of Mrs. Willis' return, Annie was pacing up and down the shady walk, and indulging in some rather melancholy and regretful thoughts, when Susan Drummond and Mary Morris rushed up to her, white with terror.  \"She's down there by the copse, and she's beckoning to us! Oh, do come with us--do, darling, dear Annie.\"  \"There's no use in it,\" replied Annie; \"Mother Rachel wants money, and I am not going to give her any. Don't be afraid of her, girls, and don't give her money. After all, why should she tell on us? she would gain nothing by doing so.\"  \"Oh, yes, she would, Annie--she would, Annie,\" said Mary Morris, beginning to sob; \"oh, do come with us, do! We must pacify her, we really must.\"  \"I can't come now,\" said Annie; \"hark! some one is calling me. Yes, Miss Danesbury--what is it?\"  \"Mrs. Willis wishes to see you at once, Annie, in her private sitting-room,\" replied Miss Danesbury; and Annie, wondering not a little, but quite unsuspicious, ran off.  The fact, however, of her having deliberately disobeyed Mrs. Willis, and done something which she knew would greatly pain her, brought a shade of embarrassment to her usually candid face. She had also to confess to herself that she did not feel quite so comfortable about Mother Rachel as she had given Mary Morris and Susan Drummond to understand. Her steps lagged more and more as she approached the house, and she wished, oh, how longingly! oh, how regretfully! that she had not been naughty and wild and disobedient in her beloved teacher's absence.  \"But where is the use of regretting what is done?\" she said, half aloud. \"I know I can never be good--never, never!\"  She pushed aside the heavy velvet curtains which shaded the door of the private sitting-room, and went in, to find Mrs. Willis seated by her desk, very pale and tired and unhappy looking, while Dora Russell, with crimson spots on her cheeks and a very angry glitter in her eyes, stood by the mantel-piece.  \"Come here, Annie dear,\" said Mrs. Willis in her usual gentle and affectionate tone.  Annie's first wild impulse was to rush to her governess' side, to fling her arms round her neck, and, as a child would confess to her mother, to tell her all that story of the walk through the wood, and the stolen picnic in the fairies' field. Three things, however, restrained her--she must not relieve her own troubles at the expense of betraying others; she could not, even if she were willing, say a word in the presence of this cold and angry-looking Dora; in the third place, Mrs. Willis looked very tired and very sad. Not for worlds would she add to her troubles at this instant. She came into the room, however, with a slight hesitation of manner and a clouded brow, which caused Mrs. Willis to watch her with anxiety and Dora with triumph.  \"Come here, Annie,\" repeated the governess. \"I want to speak to you. Something very dishonorable and disgraceful has been done in my absence.\"  Annie's face suddenly became as white as a sheet. Could the gypsy mother have already betrayed them all?  Mrs. Willis, noticing her too evident confusion, continued in a voice which, in spite of herself, became stern and severe.  \"I shall expect the truth at any cost, my dear. Look at this manuscript-book. Do you know anything of the handwriting?\"  \"Why, it is yours, of course, Dora,\" said Annie, who was now absolutely bewildered.  \"It is _not_ mine,\" began Dora, but Mrs. Willis held up her hand.  \"Allow me to speak, Miss Russell. I can best explain matters. Annie, during my absence some one has been guilty of a very base and wicked act. One of the girls in this school has gone secretly to Dora Russell's desk and taken away ten pages of an essay which she had called 'The River,' and which she was preparing for the prize competition next month. Instead of Dora's essay this that you now see was put in its place. Examine it, my dear. Can you tell me anything about it?\"  Annie took the manuscript-book and turned the leaves.  \"Is it meant for a parody?\" she asked, after a pause; \"it sounds ridiculous. No, Mrs. Willis, I know nothing whatever about it; some one has imitated Dora's handwriting. I cannot imagine who is the culprit.\"  She threw the manuscript-book with a certain easy carelessness on the table by her side, and glanced up with a twinkle of mirth in her eyes at Dora.  \"I suppose it is meant for a clever parody,\" she repeated; \"at least it is amusing.\"  Her manner displeased Mrs. Willis, and very nearly maddened poor Dora.  \"We have not sent for you, Annie,\" said her teacher, \"to ask you your opinion of the parody, but to try and get you to throw light on the subject. We must find out, and at once, who has been so wicked as to deliberately injure another girl.\"  \"But why have you sent for _me_?\" asked Annie, drawing herself up, and speaking with a little shade of haughtiness.  \"Because,\" said Dora Russell, who could no longer contain her outraged feelings, \"because you alone can throw light on it--because you alone in the school are base enough to do anything so mean--because you alone can caricature.\"  \"Oh, that is it,\" said Annie; \"you suspect me, then. Do _you_ suspect me, Mrs. Willis?\"  \"My dear--what can I say?\"  \"Nothing, if you do. In this school my word has long gone for nothing. I am a naughty, headstrong, willful girl, but in this matter I am perfectly innocent. I never saw that essay before: I never in all my life went to Dora Russell's desk. I am headstrong and wild, but I don't do spiteful things. I have no object in injuring Dora; she is nothing to me--nothing. She is trying for the essay prize, but she has no chance of winning it. Why should I trouble myself to injure her? Why should I even take the pains to parody her words and copy her handwriting? Mrs. Willis, you need not believe me--I see you do not believe me--but I am quite innocent.\"  Here Annie burst into sudden tears, and ran out of the room.     CHAPTER XXXIII.  UNTRUSTWORTHY.   Dora Russell had declared, in Hester's presence, and with intense energy in her manner, that the author of the insult to which she had been exposed should be publicly punished and, if possible, expelled. On the evening of her interview with the head teacher, she had so far forgotten herself as to reiterate this desire with extreme vehemence. She had boldly declared her firm conviction of Annie's guilt, and had broadly hinted at Mrs. Willis' favoritism toward her. The great dignity, however, of her teacher's manner, and the half-sorrowful, half-indignant look she bestowed on the excited girl, calmed her down after a time. Mrs. Willis felt full sympathy for Dora, and could well understand how trying and aggravating this practical joke must be to so proud a girl; but although her faith was undoubtedly shaken in Annie, she would not allow this sentiment to appear.  \"I will do all I can for you, Dora,\" she said, when the weeping Annie had left the room; \"I will do everything in my power to find out who has injured you. Annie has absolutely denied the accusation you bring against her, and unless her guilt can be proved it is but right to believe her innocent. There are many other girls in Lavender House, and to-morrow morning I will sift this unpleasant affair to the very bottom. Go, now, my dear, and if you have sufficient self-command and self-control, try to have courage to write your essay over again. I have no doubt that your second rendering of your subject will be more attractive than the first. Beginners cannot too often re-write their themes.\"  Dora gave her head a proud little toss, but she was sufficiently in awe of Mrs. Willis to keep back any retort, and she went out of the room feeling unsatisfied and wretched, and inclined for a sympathizing chat with her little friend Hester Thornton.  Hester, however when she reached her, seemed not at all disposed to talk to any one.  \"I've had it all out with Mrs. Willis, and there is no doubt she will be exposed to-morrow morning,\" said Dora half aloud.  Hester, whose head was bent over her French history, looked up with an annoyed expression.  \"Who will be exposed?\" she asked, in a petulant voice.  \"Oh, how stupid you are growing, Hester Thornton!\" exclaimed Dora; \"why, that horrid Annie Forest, of course--but really I have no patience to talk to you; you have lost all your spirit. I was very foolish to demean myself by taking so much notice of one of the little girls.\"  Dora sailed down the play-room to her own drawing-room, fully expecting Hester to rise and rush after her; but to her surprise Hester did not stir, but sat with her head bent over her book, and her cheeks slightly flushed.  The next morning Mrs. Willis kept her word to Dora, and made the very strictest inquiries with regard to the practical joke to which Dora had been subjected. She first of all fully explained what had taken place in the presence of the whole school, and then each girl was called up in rotation, and asked two questions: first, had she done this mischievous thing herself? second, could she throw any light on the subject.  One by one each girl appeared before her teacher, replied in the negative to both queries, and returned to her seat.  \"Now, girls,\" said Mrs. Willis, \"you have each of you denied this charge. Such a thing as has happened to Dora could not have been done without hands. The teachers in the school are above suspicion; the servants are none of them clever enough to perform this base trick. I suspect one of you, and I am quite determined to get at the truth. During the whole of this half-year there has been a spirit of unhappiness, of mischief, and of suspicion in our midst. Under these circumstances love cannot thrive; under these circumstances the true and ennobling sense of brotherly kindness, and all those feelings which real religion prompt must languish. I tell you all now plainly that I will not have this thing in Lavender House. It is simply disgraceful for one girl to play such tricks on her fellows. This is not the first time nor the second time that the school desks have been tampered with. I will find out--I am determined to find out, who this dishonest person is; and as she has not chosen to confess to me, as she has preferred falsehood to truth, I will visit her, when I do discover her, with my very gravest displeasure. In this school I have always endeavored to inculcate the true principles of honor and of trust. I have laid down certain broad rules, and expect them to be obeyed; but I have never hampered you with petty and humiliating restraints. I have given you a certain freedom, which I believed to be for your best good, and I have never suspected one of you until you have given me due cause.  \"Now, however, I tell you plainly that I alter all my tactics. One girl sitting in this room is guilty. For her sake I shall treat you all as guilty, and punish you accordingly. For the remainder of this term, or until the hour when the guilty girl chooses to release her companions, you are all, with the exception of the little children and Miss Russell, who can scarcely have played this trick on herself, under punishment. I withdraw your half-holidays, I take from you the use of the south parlor for your acting, and every drawing-room in the play-room is confiscated. But this is not all that I do. In taking from you my trust, I must treat you as untrustworthy--you will no longer enjoy the liberty you used to delight in--everywhere you will be watched. A teacher will sit in your play-room with you, a teacher will accompany you into the grounds, and I tell you plainly, girls, that chance words and phrases which drop from your lips shall be taken up, and used, if necessary, to the elucidation of this disgraceful mystery.\"  Here Mrs. Willis left the room, and the teachers desired the several girls in their classes to attend to their morning studies.  Nothing could exceed the dismay which her words had produced. The innocent girls were fairly stunned, and from that hour for many a day all sunshine and happiness seemed really to have left Lavender House.  The two, however, who felt the change most acutely, and on whose altered faces their companions began to fix suspicious eyes, were Annie Forest and Hester Thornton. Hester was burdened with an intolerable sense of the shameful falsehood she had told; Annie, guilty in another matter, succumbed at last utterly to a sense of misery and injustice. Her orphaned and lonely position for the first time began to tell on her; she ate little and slept little, her face grew very pale and thin, and her health really suffered.  All the routine of happy life at Lavender House was changed. In the large play-room the drawing-rooms were unused; there were no pleasant little knots of girls whispering happily and confidentially together, for whenever two or three girls sat down to have a chat they found that one or another of the teachers was within hearing. The acting for the coming play progressed so languidly that no one expected it would really take place, and the one relief and relaxation to the unhappy girls lay in the fact that the holidays were not far off, and that in the meantime they might work hard for the prizes.  The days passed in a truly melancholy fashion, and, perhaps, for the first time the girls fully appreciated the old privileges of freedom and trust which were now forfeited. There was a feeble little attempt at a joke and a laugh in the school at Dora's expense. The most frivolous of the girls whispered of her as she passed as \"the muddy stream;\" but no one took up the fun with avidity--the shadow of somebody's sin had fallen too heavily upon all the bright young lives.     CHAPTER XXXIV.  BETTY FALLS ILL AT AN AWKWARD TIME.   The eight girls who had gone out on their midnight picnic were much startled one day by an unpleasant discovery. Betty had never come for her basket. Susan Drummond, who had a good deal of curiosity, and always poked her nose into unexpected corners, had been walking with a Miss Allison in that part of the grounds where the laurel-bush stood. She had caught a peep of the white handle of the basket, and had instantly turned her companion's attention to something else. Miss Allison had not observed Susan's start of dismay; but Susan had taken the first opportunity of getting rid of her, and had run off in search of one of the girls who had shared in the picnic. She came across Annie Forest, who was walking, as usual, by herself, with her head slightly bent, and her curling hair in sad confusion. Susan whispered the direful intelligence that old Betty had forsaken them, and that the basket, with its ginger-beer bottles and its stained table-cloth, might be discovered at any moment.  Annie's pale face flushed slightly at Susan's words.  \"Why should we try to conceal the thing?\" she said, speaking with sudden energy, and a look of hope and animation coming back to her face. \"Susy, let's go, all of us, and tell the miserable truth to Mrs. Willis; it will be much the best way. We did not do the other thing, and when we have confessed about this, our hearts will be at rest.\"  \"No, we did not do the other thing,\" said Susan, a queer, gray color coming over her face; \"but confess about this, Annie Forest!--I think you are mad. You dare not tell.\"  \"All right,\" said Annie, \"I won't, unless you all agree to it,\" and then she continued her walk, leaving Susan standing on the graveled path with her hands clasped together, and a look of most genuine alarm and dismay on her usually phlegmatic face.  Susan quickly found Phyllis and Nora, and it was only too easy to arouse the fears of these timid little people. Their poor little faces became almost pallid, and they were not a little startled at the fact of Annie Forest, their own arch-conspirator, wishing to betray their secret.  \"Oh,\" said Susan Drummond, \"she's not out and out shabby; she says she won't tell unless we all wish it. But what is to become of the basket?\"  \"Come, come, young ladies; no whispering, if you please,\" said Miss Good, who came up at this moment. \"Susan, you are looking pale and cold, walk up and down that path half-a-dozen times, and then go into the house. Phyllis and Nora, you can come with me as far as the lodge. I want to take a message from Mrs. Willis to Mary Martin about the fowl for to-morrow's dinner.\"  Phyllis and Nora, with dismayed faces, walked solemnly away with the English teacher, and Susan was left to her solitary meditations.  Things had come to such a pass that her slow wits were brought into play, and she neither felt sleepy, nor did she indulge in her usual habit of eating lollipops.  That basket might be discovered any day, and then--then disgrace was imminent. Susan could not make out what had become of old Betty; never before had she so utterly failed them.  Betty lived in a little cottage about half a mile from Lavender House. She was a sturdy, apple-cheeked, little old woman, and had for many a day added to her income--indeed, almost supported herself--by means of the girls at Lavender House. The large cherry-trees in her little garden bore their rich crop of fruit year after year for Mrs. Willis' girls, and every day at an early hour Betty would tramp into Sefton and return with a temptingly-laden basket of the most approved cakes and tarts. There was a certain paling at one end of the grounds to which Betty used to come. Here on the grass she would sit contentedly, with the contents of her baskets arranged in the most tempting order before her, and to this seductive spot she knew well that those little misses who loved goodies, cakes and tartlets would be sure to find their way. Betty charged high for her wares; but, as she was always obliging in the matter of credit, the thoughtless girls cared very little that they paid double the shop prices for Betty's cakes. The best girls in the school, certainly, never went to Betty; but Annie Forest, Susan Drummond, and several others had regular accounts with her, and few days passed that their young faces would not peep over the paling and their voices ask:  \"What have you got to tempt me with to-day, Betty?\"  It was, however, in the matter of stolen picnics, of grand feasts in the old attic, etc., etc., that Betty was truly great. No one so clever as she in concealing a basket of delicious eatables, no one knew better what schoolgirls liked. She undoubtedly charged her own prices, but what she gave was of the best, and Betty was truly in her element when she had an order from the young ladies of Lavender House for a grand secret feast.  \"You shall have it, my pretties--you shall have it,\" she would say, wrinkling up her bright blue eyes, and smiling broadly. \"You leave it to Betty, my little loves; you leave it to Betty.\"  On the occasion of the picnic to the fairies' field Betty had, indeed, surpassed herself in the delicious eatables she had provided; all had gone smoothly, the basket had been placed in a secure hiding-place under the thick laurel. It was to be fetched away by Betty herself at an early hour on the following morning.  No wonder Susan was perplexed as she paced about and pretended to warm herself. It was a June evening, but the weather was still a little cold. Susan remembered now that Betty had not come to her favorite station at the stile for several days. Was it possible that the old woman was ill? As this idea occurred to her, Susan became more alarmed. She knew that there was very little chance of the basket remaining long in concealment. Rover might any day remember his pleasant picnic with affection, and drag the white basket from under the laurel-bush. Michael the gardener would be certain to see it when next he cleaned up the back avenue. Oh, it was more than dangerous to leave it there, and yet Susan knew of no better hiding-place. A sudden idea came to her; she pulled out her pretty little watch, and saw that she need not return to the house for another half-hour. \"Suppose she ran as fast as possible to Betty's little cottage and begged of the old woman to come by the first light in the morning and fetch away the basket?\"  The moment Susan conceived this idea she resolved to put it into execution. She looked around her hastily: no teacher was in sight, Miss Good was away at the lodge, Miss Danesbury was playing with the little children. Mademoiselle, she knew, had gone indoors with a bad headache. She left the broad walk where she had been desired to stay, and plunging into the shrubbery, soon reached Betty's paling. In a moment she had climbed the bars, had jumped lightly into the field, and was running as fast as possible in the direction of Betty's cottage. She reached the high road, and started and trembled violently as a carriage with some ladies and gentlemen passed her. She thought she recognized the faces of the two little Misses Bruce, but did not dare to look at them, and hurried panting along the road, and hoping she might be mistaken.  In less than a quarter of an hour she had reached Betty's little cottage, and was standing trying to recover her breath by the shut door. The place had a deserted look, and several overripe cherries had fallen from the trees and were lying neglected on the ground. Susan knocked impatiently. There was no discernible answer. She had no time to wait, she lifted the latch, which yielded to her pressure, and went in.  Poor old Betty, crippled, and in severe pain with rheumatism, was lying on her little bed.  \"Eh, dear--and is that you, my pretty missy?\" she asked, as Susan, hot and tired, came up to her side.  \"Oh, Betty, are you ill?\" asked Miss Drummond \"I came to tell you you have forgotten the basket.\"  \"No, my dear, no--not forgot. By no means that, lovey; but I has been took with the rheumatism this past week, and can't move hand or foot. I was wondering how you'd do without your cakes and tartlets, dear, and to think of them cherries lying there good for nothing on the ground is enough to break one's 'eart.\"  \"So it is,\" said Susan, giving an appreciative glance toward the open door. \"They are beautiful cherries, and full of juice, I am sure. I'll take a few, Betty, as I am going out, and pay you for them another day. But what I have come about now is the basket. You must get the basket away, however ill you are. If the basket is discovered we are all lost, and then good-by to your gains.\"  \"Well, missy, dear, if I could crawl on my hands and knees I'd go and fetch it, rather than you should be worried; but I can't set foot to the ground at all. The doctor says as 'tis somethink like rheumatic fever as I has.\"  \"Oh, dear, oh, dear,\" said Susan, not wasting any of her precious moments in pitying the poor suffering old woman. \"What _is_ to be done? I tell you, Betty, if that basket is found we are all lost.\"  \"But the laurel is very thick, lovey: it ain't likely to be found--it ain't, indeed.\"  \"I tell you it _is_ likely to be found, you tiresome old woman, and you really must go for it or send for it. You really must.\"  Old Betty began to ponder.  \"There's Moses,\" she said, after a pause of anxious thought; \"he's a 'cute little chap, and he might go. He lives in the fourth cottage along the lane. Moses is his name--Moses Moore. I'd give him a pint of cherries for the job. If you wouldn't mind sending Moses to me, Miss Susan, why, I'll do my best; only it seems a pity to let anybody into your secrets, young ladies, but old Betty herself.\"  \"It is a pity,\" said Susan, \"but, under the circumstances, it can't be helped. What cottage did you say this Moses lived in?\"  \"The fourth from here, down the lane, lovey--Moses is the lad's name; he's a freckled boy, with a cast in one eye. You send him up to me, dearie; but don't mention the cherries, or he'll be after stealing them. He's a sad rogue, is Moses; but I think I can tempt him with the cherries.\"  Susan did not wait to bid poor old Betty \"good-bye,\" but ran out of the cottage, shutting the door after her, and snatching up two or three ripe cherries to eat on her way. She was so far fortunate as to find the redoubtable Moses at home, and to convey him bodily to old Betty's presence. The queer boy grinned horribly, and looked as wicked as boy could look; but on the subject of cherries he was undoubtedly susceptible, and after a good deal of haggling and insisting that the pint should be a quart, he expressed his willingness to start off at four o'clock on the following morning, and bring away the basket from under the laurel-tree.     CHAPTER XXXV.  \"YOU ARE WELCOME TO TELL.\"   Annie continued her walk. The circumstances of the last two months had combined to do for her what nothing had hitherto effected. When a little child she had known hardship and privation, she had passed through that experience which is metaphorically spoken of as \"going down hill.\" As a baby little Annie had been surrounded by comforts and luxuries, and her father and mother had lived in a large house, and kept a carriage, and Annie had two nurses to wait on herself alone. These were in the days before she could remember anything. With her first early memories came the recollection of a much smaller house, of much fewer servants, of her mother often in tears, and her father often away. Then there was no house at all that the Forests could call their own, only rooms of a tolerably cheerful character--and Annie's nurse went away, and she took her daily walks by her mother's side and slept in a little cot in her mother's room. Then came a very, very sad day, when her mother lay cold and still and fainting on her bed, and her tall and handsome father caught Annie in his arms and pressed her to his heart, and told her to be a good child and to keep up her spirits, and, above all things, to take care of mother. Then her father had gone away; and though Annie expected him back, he did not come, and she and her mother went into poorer and shabbier lodgings, and her mother began to try her tear-dimmed eyes by working at church embroidery, and Annie used to notice that she coughed a good deal as she worked. Then there was another move, and this time Mrs. Forest and her little daughter found themselves in one bedroom, and things began to grow very gloomy, and food even was scarce. At last there was a change. One day a lady came into the dingy little room, and all on a sudden it seemed as if the sun had come out again. This lady brought comforts with her--toys and books for the child, good, brave words of cheer for the mother. At last Annie's mother died, and she went away to Lavender House to live with this good friend who had made her mother's dying hours easy.  \"Annie, Annie,\" said the dying mother, \"I owe everything to Mrs. Willis; we knew each other long ago when we were girls, and she has come to me now and made everything easy. When I am gone she will take care of you. Oh, my child, I cannot repay her; but will you try?\"  \"Yes, mother,\" said little Annie, gazing full into her mother's face with her sweet bright eyes, \"I'll--I'll love her, mother; I'll give her lots and lots of love.\"  Annie had gone to Lavender House, and kept her word, for she had almost worshiped the good mistress who was so true and kind to her, and who had so befriended her mother. Through all the vicissitudes of her short existence Annie had, however, never lost one precious gift. Hers was an affectionate, but also a wonderfully bright, nature. It was as impossible for Annie to turn away from laughter and merriment as it would be for a flower to keep its head determinately turned from the sun. In their darkest days Annie had managed to make her mother laugh; her little face was a sunbeam, her very naughtinesses were of a laughable character.  Her mother died--her father was still away, but Annie retained her brave and cheerful spirit, for she gave and received love. Mrs. Willis loved her--she bestowed upon her among all her girls the tenderest glances, the most motherly caresses. The teachers undoubtedly corrected and even scolded her, but they could not help liking her, and even her worst scrapes made them smile. Annie's companions adored her; the little children would do anything for their own Annie, and even the servants in the school said that there was no young lady in Lavender House fit to hold a candle to Miss Forest.  During the last half-year, however, things had been different. Suspicion and mistrust began to dog the footsteps of the bright young girl; she was no longer a universal favorite--some of the girls even openly expressed their dislike of her.  All this Annie could have borne, but for the fact that Mrs. Willis joined in the universal suspicion. The old glance now never came to her eyes, nor the old tone to her voice. For the first time Annie's spirits utterly flagged; she could not bear this universal coldness, this universal chill. She began to droop physically as well as mentally.  She was pacing up and down the walk, thinking very sadly, wondering vaguely, if her father would ever return, and conscious of a feeling of more or less indifference to everything and every one, when she was suddenly roused from her meditation by the patter of small feet and by a very eager little exclamation:  \"Me tumming--me tumming, Annie!\" and then Nan raised her charming face and placed her cool baby hand in Annie's.  There was delicious comfort in the clasp of the little hand, and in the look of love and pleasure which lit up the small face.  \"Me yiding from naughty nurse--me 'tay with you, Annie--me love 'oo, Annie.\"  Annie stooped down, kissed the little one, and lifted her into her arms.  \"Why ky?\" said Nan, who saw with consternation two big tears in Annie's eyes; \"dere, poor ickle Annie--me love 'oo--me buy 'oo a new doll.\"  \"Dearest little darling,\" said Annie in a voice of almost passionate pain; then, with that wonderful instinct which made her in touch with all little children, she cheered up, wiped away her tears, and allowed laughter once more to wreathe her lips and fill her eyes. \"Come, Nan,\" she said, \"you and I will have such a race.\"  She placed the child on her shoulder, clasped the little hands securely round her neck, and ran to the sound of Nan's shouts down the shady walk.  At the farther end Nan suddenly tightened her clasp, drew herself up, ceased to laugh, and said with some fright in her voice:  \"Who dat?\"  Annie, too, stood still with a sudden start, for the gypsy woman, Mother Rachel, was standing directly in their path.  \"Go 'way, naughty woman,\" said Nan, shaking her small hand imperiously.  The gypsy dropped a low courtesy, and spoke in a slightly mocking tone.  \"A pretty little dear,\" she said. \"Yes, truly now, a pretty little winsome dear; and oh, what shoes! and little open-work socks! and I don't doubt real lace trimming on all her little garments--I don't doubt it a bit.\"  \"Go 'way--me don't like 'oo,\" said Nan. \"Let's wun back--gee, gee,\" she said, addressing Annie, whom she had constituted into a horse for the time being.  \"Yes, Nan; in one minute,\" said Annie. \"Please, Mother Rachel, what are you doing here?\"  \"Only waiting to see you, pretty missie,\" replied the tall gypsy. \"You are the dear little lady who crossed my hand with silver that night in the wood. Eh, but it was a bonny night, with a bonny bright moon, and none of the dear little ladies meant any harm--no, no, Mother Rachel knows that.\"  \"Look here,\" said Annie, \"I'm not going to be afraid of you. I have no more silver to give you. If you like, you may go up to the house and tell what you have seen. I am very unhappy, and whether you tell or not can make very little difference to me now. Good-night; I am not the least afraid of you--you can do just as you please about telling Mrs. Willis.\"  \"Eh, my dear?\" said the gypsy; \"do you think I'd work you any harm--you, and the seven other dear little ladies? No, not for the world, my dear--not for the world. You don't know Mother Rachel when you think she'd be that mean.\"  \"Well, don't come here again,\" said Annie. \"Good-night.\"  She turned on her heel, and Nan shouted back:  \"Go way, naughty woman--Nan don't love 'oo, 'tall, 'tall.\"  The gypsy stood still for a moment with a frown knitting her brows; then she slowly turned, and, creeping on all-fours through the underwood, climbed the hedge into the field beyond.  \"Oh, no,\" she laughed, after a moment; \"the little missy thinks she ain't afraid of me; but she be. Trust Mother Rachel for knowing that much. I make no doubt,\" she added after a pause, \"that the little one's clothes are trimmed with real lace. Well, little Missie Annie Forest, I can see with half an eye that you set store by that baby-girl. You had better not cross Mother Rachel's whims, or she can punish you in a way you don't think of.\"     CHAPTER XXXVI.  HOW MOSES MOORE KEPT HIS APPOINTMENT.   Susan Drummond got back to Lavender House without apparent discovery. She was certainly late when she took her place in the class-room for her next day's preparation; but, beyond a very sharp reprimand from mademoiselle, no notice was taken of this fact. She managed to whisper to Nora and Phyllis that the basket would be moved by the first dawn the next morning, and the little girls went to bed happier in consequence. Nothing ever could disturb Susan's slumbers, and that night she certainly slept without rocking. As she was getting into bed she ventured to tell Annie how successfully she had manoeuvered; but Annie received her news with the most absolute indifference, looking at her for a moment with a queer smile, and then saying:  \"My own wish is that this should be found out. As a matter of course, I sha'n't betray you, girls; but as things now stand I am anxious that Mrs. Willis should know the very worst of me.\"  After a remark which Susan considered so simply idiotic, there was, of course, no further conversation between the two girls.  Moses Moore had certainly promised Betty to rise soon after dawn on the following morning, and go to Lavender House to carry off the basket from under the laurel-tree. Moses, a remarkably indolent lad, had been stimulated by the thought of the delicious cherries which would be his as soon as he brought the basket to Betty. He had cleverly stipulated that a quart--not a pint--of cherries was to be his reward, and he looked forward with considerable pleasure to picking them himself, and putting a few extra ones into his mouth on the sly.  Moses was not at all the kind of a boy who would have scrupled to steal a few cherries; but in this particular old Betty, ill as she was, was too sharp for him or for any of the other village lads. Her bed was drawn up close to her little window, and her window looked directly on to the two cherry trees. Never, to all appearance, did Betty close her eyes. However early the hour might be in which a village boy peeped over the wall of her garden, he always saw her white night-cap moving, and he knew that her bright blue eyes would be on him, and he would be proclaimed a thief all over the place before many minutes were over.  Moses, therefore, was very glad to secure his cherries by fair means, as he could not obtain them by foul; and he went to bed and to sleep, determined to be off on his errand with the dawn.  A very natural thing, however, happened. Moses, unaccustomed to getting up at half-past three in the morning, never opened his eyes until the church clock struck five. Then he started upright, rubbed and rubbed at his sleepy orbs, tumbled into his clothes, and, softly opening the cottage door, set off on his errand.  The fact of his being nearly an hour and a half late did not trouble him in the least. In any case, he would get to Lavender House before six o'clock, and would have consumed his cherries in less than an hour from that date.  Moses sauntered gaily along the roads, whistling as he went, and occasionally tossing his battered cap in the air. He often lingered on his way, now to cut down a particularly tempting switch from the hedge, now to hunt for a possible bird's nest. It was very nearly six o'clock when he reached the back avenue, swung himself over the gate, which was locked, and ran softly on the dewy grass in the direction of the laurel bush. Old Betty had given him most careful instructions, and he was far too sharp a lad to forget what was necessary for the obtaining of a quart of cherries. He found his tree, and lay flat down on the ground in order to pull out the basket. His fingers had just clasped the handle when there came a sudden interruption--a rush, a growl, and some very sharp teeth had inserted themselves into the back of his ragged jacket. Poor Moses found himself, to his horror, in the clutches of a great mastiff. The creature held him tight, and laid one heavy paw on him to prevent him rising.  Under these circumstances, Moses thought it quite unnecessary to retain any self-control. He shrieked, he screamed, he wriggled; his piercing yells filled the air, and, fortunately for him, his being two hours too late brought assistance to his aid. Michael, the gardener, and a strong boy who helped him, rushed to the spot, and liberated the terrified lad, who, after all, was only frightened, for Rover had satisfied himself with tearing his jacket to pieces, not himself.  \"Give me the b-basket,\" sobbed Moses, \"and let me g-g-go.\"  \"You may certainly go, you little tramp,\" said Michael, \"but Jim and me will keep the basket. I much misdoubt me if there isn't mischief here. What's the basket put hiding here for, and who does it belong to?\"  \"Old B-B-Betty,\" gasped forth the agitated Moses.  \"Well, let old Betty fetch it herself. Mrs. Willis will keep it for her,\" said Michael. \"Come along, Jim, get to your weeding, do. There, little scamp, you had better make yourself scarce.\"  Moses certainly took his advice, for he scuttled off like a hare. Whether he ever got his cherries or not, history does not disclose.  Michael, looking gravely at Jim, opened the basket, examined its contents, and, shaking his head solemnly, carried it into the house.  \"There's been deep work going on, Jim, and my missis ought to know,\" said Michael, who was an exceedingly strict disciplinarian. Jim, however, had a soft corner in his heart for the young ladies, and he commenced his weeding with a profound sigh.     CHAPTER XXXVII  A BROKEN TRUST.   The next morning Annie Forest opened her eyes with that strange feeling of indifference and want of vivacity which come so seldom to youth. She saw the sun shining through the closed blinds; she heard the birds twittering and singing in the large elm-tree which nearly touched the windows; she knew well how the world looked at this moment, for often and often in her old light-hearted days she had risen before the maid came to call her, and, kneeling by the deep window-ledge, had looked out at the bright, fresh, sparkling day. A new day, with all its hours before it, its light vivid but not too glaring, its dress all manner of tender shades and harmonious colorings! Annie had a poetical nature, and she gloried in these glimpses which she got all by herself of the fresh, glad world.  To-day, however, she lay still, sorry to know that the brief night was at an end, and that the day, with its coldness and suspicion, its terrible absence of love and harmony, was about to begin.  Annie's nature was very emotional; she was intensely sensitive to her surroundings; the grayness of her present life was absolute destruction to such a nature as hers.  The dressing-bell rang; the maid came in to draw up the blinds, and call the girls. Annie rose languidly and began to dress herself.  She first finished her toilet, and then approached her little bed, and stood by its side for a moment hesitating. She did not want to pray, and yet she felt impelled to go down on her knees. As she knelt with her curls falling about her face, and her hands pressed to her eyes, one line of one of her favorite poems came flashing with swiftness and power across her memory:              \"A soul which has sinned and is pardoned again.\"  The words filled her whole heart with a sudden sense of peace and of great longing.  The prayer-bell rang: she rose, and, turning to Susan Drummond, said earnestly:  \"Oh, Susy, I do wish Mrs. Willis could know about our going to the fairy-field; I do so want God to forgive me.\"  Susan stared in her usual dull, uncomprehending way; then she flushed a little, and said brusquely:  \"I think you have quite taken leave of your senses, Annie Forest.\"  Annie said no more, but at prayers in the chapel she was glad to find herself near gentle Cecil Temple, and the words kept repeating themselves to her all during the morning lessons:              \"A soul which has sinned and is pardoned again.\"  Just before morning school several of the girls started and looked distressed when they found that Mrs. Willis lingered in the room. She stood for a moment by the English teacher's desk, said something to her in a low voice, and then, walking slowly to her own post at the head of the great school-room, she said suddenly:  \"I want to ask you a question, Miss Drummond. Will you please just stand up in your place in class and answer me without a moment's hesitation.\"  Phyllis and Nora found themselves turning very pale; Mary Price and one or two more of the rebels also began to tremble, but Susan looked dogged and indifferent enough as she turned her eyes toward her teacher.  \"Yes, madam,\" she said, rising and dropping a courtesy.  \"My friends, the Misses Bruce, came to call on me yesterday evening, Susan, and told me that they saw you running very quickly on the high road in the direction of the village. You, of course, know that you broke a very distinct rule when you left the grounds without leave. Tell me at once where you were going.\"  Susan hesitated, colored to her dullest red, and looked down. Then, because she had no ready excuse to offer, she blurted out the truth:  \"I was going to see old Betty.\"  \"The cake-woman?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"What for?\"  \"I--I heard she was ill.\"  \"Indeed--you may sit down, Miss Drummond. Miss Good, will you ask Michael to step for a moment into the school-room?\"  Several of the girls now indeed held their breath, and more than one heart beat with heavy, frightened bumps as a moment later Michael followed Miss Good into the room, carrying the redoubtable picnic-basket on his arm.  \"Michael,\" said Mrs. Willis, \"I wish you to tell the young ladies exactly how you found the basket this morning. Stand by my side, please, and speak loud enough for them to hear.\"  After a moment's pause Michael related somewhat diffusely and with an occasional break in his narrative the scene which had occurred between him and Moses that morning.  \"That will do, Michael; you can now go,\" said the head mistress.  She waited until the old servant had closed the door, and then she turned to her girls:  \"It is not quite a fortnight since I stood where I now stand, and asked one girl to be honorable and to save her companions. One girl was guilty of sin and would not confess, and for her sake all her companions are now suffering. I am tired of this sort of thing--I am tired of standing in this place and appealing to your honor, which is dead, to your truth which is nowhere. Girls, you puzzle me--you half break my heart. In this case more than one is guilty. How many of the girls in Lavender House are going to tell me a lie this morning?\"  There was a brief pause; then a slight cry, and a girl rose from her seat and walked up the long school-room.  \"I am the most guilty of all,\" said Annie Forest.  \"Annie!\" said Mrs. Willis, in a tone half of pain, half of relief, \"have you come to your senses at last?\"  \"Oh, I'm so glad to be able to speak the truth,\" said Annie. \"Please punish me very, very hard; I am the most guilty of all.\"  \"What did you do with this basket?\"  \"We took it for a picnic--it was my plan, I led the others.\"  \"Where was your picnic?\"  \"In the fairies' field.\"  \"Ah! At what time?\"  \"At night--in the middle of the night--the night you went to London.\"  Mrs. Willis put her hand to her brow; her face was very white and the girls could see that she trembled.  \"I trusted my girls----\" she said; then she broke off abruptly.  \"You had companions in this wickedness--name them.\"  \"Yes, I had companions; I led them on.\"  \"Name them, Miss Forest.\"  For the first time Annie raised her eyes to Mrs. Willis' face; then she turned and looked down the long school-room.  \"Oh, won't they tell themselves?\" she said.  Nothing could be more appealing than her glance. It melted the hearts of Phyllis and Nora, who began to sob, and to declare brokenly that they had gone too, and that they were very, very sorry.  Spurred by their example Mary Price also confessed, and one by one all the little conspirators revealed the truth, with the exception of Susan, who kept her eyes steadily fixed on the floor.  \"Susan Drummond,\" said Mrs. Willis, \"come here.\"  There was something in her tone which startled every girl in the school. Never had they heard this ring in their teacher's voice before.  \"Susan,\" said Mrs. Willis, \"I don't ask you if you are guilty; I fear, poor miserable girl, that if I did you would load your conscience with a fresh lie. I don't ask you if you are guilty because I know you are. The fact of your running without leave to see old Betty is circumstantial evidence. I judge you by that and pronounce you guilty. Now, young ladies, you who have treated me so badly, who have betrayed my trust, who have been wanting in honor, I must think, I must ask God to teach me how to deal with you. In the meantime, you cannot associate with your companions. Miss Good, will you take each of these eight girls to their bedrooms.\"  As Annie was leaving the room she looked full into Mrs. Willis' face. Strange to say, at this moment of her great disgrace the cloud which had so long brooded over her was lifted. The sweet eyes never looked sweeter. The old Annie, and yet a better and a braver Annie than had ever existed before, followed her companions out of the school-room.     CHAPTER XXXVIII.  IS SHE STILL GUILTY?   On the evening of that day Cecil Temple knocked at the door of Mrs. Willis' private sitting-room.  \"Ah, Cecil! is that you?\" said her governess. \"I am always glad to see you, dear; but I happen to be particularly busy to-night. Have you anything in particular to say to me?\"  \"I only wanted to talk about Annie, Mrs. Willis. You believe in her at last, don't you?\"  \"Believe in her at last!\" said the head-mistress in a tone of astonishment and deep pain. \"No, Cecil, my dear; you ask too much of my faith. I do not believe in Annie.\"  Cecil paused; she hesitated, and seemed half afraid to proceed.  \"Perhaps,\" she said at last in a slightly timid tone, \"you have not seen her since this morning?\"  \"No; I have been particularly busy. Besides, the eight culprits are under punishment; part of their punishment is that I will not see them.\"  \"Don't you think, Mrs. Willis,\" said Cecil, \"that Annie made rather a brave confession this morning?\"  \"I admit, my dear, that Annie spoke in somewhat of her old impulsive way; she blamed herself, and did not try to screen her misdemeanors behind her companions. In this one particular she reminded me of the old Annie who, notwithstanding all her faults, I used to trust and love. But as to her confession being very brave, my dear Cecil, you must remember that she did not _confess_ until she was obliged; she knew, and so did all the other girls, that I could have got the truth out of old Betty had they chosen to keep their lips sealed. Then, my dear, consider what she did. On the very night that I was away she violated the trust I had in her--she bade me 'good-bye' with smiles and sweet glances, and then she did this in my absence. No, Cecil, I fear poor Annie is not what we thought her. She has done untold mischief during the half-year, and has willfully lied and deceived me. I find, on comparing dates, that it was on the very night of the girls' picnic that Dora's theme was changed. There is no doubt whatever that Annie was the guilty person. I did my best to believe in her, and to depend on Mr. Everard's judgment of her character, but I confess I can do so no longer. Cecil, dear. I am not surprised that you look pale and sad. No, we will not give up this poor Annie: we will try to love her even through her sin. Ah! poor child, poor child! how much I have prayed for her! She was to me as a child of my own. Now, dear Cecil, I must ask you to leave me.\"  Cecil went slowly out of her governess' presence, and, wandering across the wide stone hall, she entered the play-room. It happened to be a wet night, and the room was full of girls, who hung together in groups and whispered softly. There were no loud voices, and, except from the little ones, there was no laughter. A great depression hung over the place, and few could have recognized the happy girls of Lavender House in these sad young faces. Cecil walked slowly into the room, and presently finding Hester Thornton, she sat down by her side.  \"I can't get Mrs. Willis to see it,\" she said very sadly.  \"What?\" asked Hester.  \"Why, that we have got our old Annie back again; that she did take the girls out to that picnic, and was as wild, and reckless, and naughty as possible about it; and then, just like the old Annie I have always known, the moment the fun was over she began to repent, and that she has gone on repenting ever since, which has accounted for her poor sad little face and white cheeks. Of course she longed to tell--Nora and Phyllis have told me so--but she would not betray them. Now at last there is a load off her heart, and, though she is in great disgrace and punishment, she is not very unhappy. I went to see her an hour ago, and I saw in her face that my own darling Annie has returned. But what do you think Mrs. Willis does, Hester? She is so hurt and disappointed, that she believes Annie is guilty of the other thing--she believes that Annie stole Dora's theme, and that she caricatured her in my book some time ago. She believes it--she is sure of it. Now, do you think, Hester, that Annie's face would look quite peaceful and happy to-night if she had only confessed half her faults--if she had this meanness, this sin, these lies still resting on her soul? Oh! I wish Mrs. Willis would see her! I wish--I wish! but I can do nothing. You agree with me, don't you, Hester? Just put yourself in Annie's place, and tell me if _you_ would feel happy, and if your heart would be at rest, if you had only confessed half your sin, and if through you all your schoolfellows were under disgrace and suspicion? You could not, could you, Hester? Why, Hester, how white you are!\"  \"You are so metaphysical,\" said Hester, rising; \"you quite puzzle me. How can I put myself in your friend Annie's place? I never understood her--I never wanted to. Put myself in her place?--no, certainly that I'm never likely to. I hope that I shall never be in such a predicament.\"  Hester walked away, and Cecil sat still in great perplexity.  Cecil was a girl with a true sense of religion. The love of God guided every action of her simple and straightforward life. She was neither beautiful nor clever; but no one in the school was more respected and honored, no one more sincerely loved. Cecil knew what the peace of God meant, and when she saw even a shadowy reflection of that peace on Annie's little face, she was right in believing that she must be innocent of the guilt which was attributed to her.  The whole school assembled for prayers that night in the little chapel, and Mr. Everard, who had heard the story of that day's confession from Mrs. Willis, said a few words appropriate to the occasion to the unhappy young girls.  Whatever effect his words had on the others, and they were very simple and straightforward, Annie's face grew quiet and peaceful as she listened to them. The old clergyman assured the girls that God was waiting to forgive those who truly repented, and that the way to repent was to rise up and sin no more.  \"The present fun is not worth the after-pain,\" he said, in conclusion. \"It is an old saying that stolen waters are sweet, but only at the time; afterward only those who drink of them know the full extent of their bitterness.\"  This little address from Mr. Everard strengthened poor Annie for an ordeal which was immediately before her, for Mrs. Willis asked all the school to follow her to the play-room, and there she told them that she was about to restore to them their lost privileges; that circumstances, in her opinion, now so strongly pointed the guilt of the stolen essay in the direction of one girl, that she could no longer ask the school to suffer for her sake.  \"She still refuses to confess her sin,\" said Mrs. Willis, \"but, unless another girl proclaims herself guilty, and proves to me beyond doubt that she drew the caricature which was found in Cecil Temple's book, and that she changed Dora Russell's essay, and, imitating her hand, put another in its place, I proclaim the guilty person to be Annie Forest, and on her alone I visit my displeasure. You can retire to your rooms, young ladies. Tomorrow morning Lavender House resumes its old cheerfulness.\"     CHAPTER XXXIX.  HESTER'S HOUR OF TRIAL.   However calmly or however peacefully Annie slept that night, poor Hester did not close her eyes. The white face of the girl she had wronged and injured kept rising before her. Why had she so deceived Annie? Why from the very first had she turned from her, and misjudged her, and misrepresented her? Was Annie, indeed, all bad? Hester had to own to herself that to-night Annie was better than she--was greater than she. Could she now have undone the past, she would not have acted as she had done; she would not for the sake of a little paltry revenge have defiled her conscience with a lie, have told her governess that she could throw no light on the circumstance of the stolen essay. This was the first lie Hester had ever told; she was naturally both straightforward and honorable, but her sin of sins, that which made her hard and almost unlovable, was an intensely proud and haughty spirit. She was very sorry she had told that lie; she was very sorry she had yielded to that temptation; but not for worlds would she now humble herself to confess--not for worlds would she let the school know of her cowardice and shame. No, if there was no other means of clearing Annie except through her confession, she must remain with the shadow of this sin over her to her dying day.  Hester, however, was now really unhappy, and also truly sorry for poor Annie. Could she have got off without disgrace or punishment, she would have been truly glad to see Annie exonerated. She was quite certain that Susan Drummond was at the bottom of all the mischief which had been done lately at Lavender House. She could not make out how stupid Susan was clever enough to caricature and to imitate peoples' hands. Still she was convinced that she was the guilty person, and she wondered and wondered if she could induce Susan to come forward and confess the truth, and so save Annie without bringing her, Hester, into any trouble.  She resolved to speak to Susan, and without confessing that she had been in the school-room on the night the essay was changed, to let her know plainly that she suspected her.  She became much calmer when she determined to carry out this resolve, and toward morning she fell asleep.  She was awakened at a very early hour by little Nan clambering over the side of her crib, and cuddling down cozily in a way she loved by Hester's side.  \"Me so 'nug, 'nug,\" said little Nan. \"Oh, Hetty, Hetty, there's a wy on the teiling!\"  Hester had then to rouse herself, and enter into an animated conversation on the subject of flies generally, and in especial she had to talk of that particular fly which would perambulate on the ceiling over Nan's head.  \"Me like wies,\" said Nan, \"and me like 'oo, Hetty, and me love--me love Annie.\"  Hester kissed her little sister passionately; but this last observation, accompanied by the expression of almost angelic devotion which filled little Nan's brown eyes, as she repeated that she liked flies and Hetty, but that she loved Annie, had the effect of again hardening her heart.  Hester's hour of trial, however, was at hand, and before that day was over she was to experience that awful emptiness and desolation which those know whom God is punishing.  Lessons went on as usual at Lavender House that morning, and, to the surprise of several, Annie was seen in her old place in class. She worked with a steadiness quite new to her; no longer interlarding her hours of study with those indescribable glances of fun and mischief, first at one school-companion and then at another, which used to worry her teachers so much.  There were no merry glances from Annie that morning; but she worked steadily and rapidly, and went through that trying ordeal, her French verbs, with such satisfaction that mademoiselle was on the point of praising her, until she remembered that Annie was in disgrace.  After school, however, Annie did not join her companions in the grounds, but went up to her bedroom, where, by Mrs. Willis' orders, she was to remain until the girls went in. She was to take her own exercise later in the day.  It was now the tenth of June--an intensely sultry day; a misty heat brooded over everything, and not a breath of air stirred the leaves in the trees. The girls wandered about languidly, too enervated by the heat to care to join in any noisy games. They were now restored to their full freedom, and there is no doubt they enjoyed the privileges of having little confabs, and whispering secrets to each other without having Miss Good and Miss Danesbury forever at their elbows. They talked of many things--of the near approach of the holidays, of the prize day which was now so close at hand, of Annie's disgrace, and so on.  They wondered, many of them, if Annie would ever be brought to confess her sin, and, if not, how Mrs. Willis would act toward her. Dora Russell said in her most contemptuous tones:  \"She is nothing, after all, but a charity child, and Mrs. Willis has supported her for years for nothing.\"  \"Yes, and she's too clever by half; eh, poor old Muddy Stream?\" remarked a saucy little girl. \"By the way, Dora, dear, how goes the river now? Has it lost itself in the arms of mother ocean yet?\"  Dora turned red and walked away, and her young tormentor exclaimed with considerable gusto:  \"There, I have silenced her for a bit; I do hate the way she talks about charity children. Whatever her faults, Annie is the sweetest and prettiest girl in the school, in my opinion.\"  In the meantime Hester was looking in all directions for Susan Drummond. She thought the present a very fitting opportunity to open her attack on her, and she was the more anxious to bring her to reason as a certain look in Annie's face--a pallid and very weary look--had gone to her heart, and touched her in spite of herself. Now, even though little Nan loved her, Hester would save Annie could she do so not at her own expense.  Look, however, as she would, nowhere could she find Miss Drummond. She called and called, but no sleepy voice replied. Susan, indeed, knew better; she had curled herself up in a hammock which hung between the boughs of a shady tree, and though Hester passed under her very head, she was sucking lollipops and going off comfortably into the land of dreams, and had no intention of replying. Hester wandered down the shady walk, and at its farther end she was gratified by the sight of little Nan, who, under her nurse's charge, was trying to string daisies on the grass. Hester sat down by her side, and Nan climbed over and made fine havoc of her neat print dress, and laughed, and was at her merriest and best.  \"I hear say that that naughty Miss Forest has done something out-and-out disgraceful,\" whispered the nurse.  \"Oh, don't!\" said Hester impatiently. \"Why should every one throw mud at a girl when she is down? If poor Annie is naughty and guilty, she is suffering now.\"  \"Annie _not_ naughty,\" said little Nan. \"Me love my own Annie; me do, me do.\"  \"And you love your own poor old nurse, too?\" responded the somewhat jealous nurse.  Hester left the two playing happily together, the little one caressing her nurse, and blowing one or two kisses after her sister's retreating form. Hester returned to the house, and went up to her room to prepare for dinner. She had washed her hands, and was standing before the looking-glass re-plaiting her long hair, when Susan Drummond, looking extremely wild and excited, and with her eyes almost starting out of her head, rushed into the room.  \"Oh, Hester, Hester!\" she gasped, and she flung herself on Hester's bed, with her face downward; she seemed absolutely deprived for the moment of the power of any further speech.  \"What is the matter, Susan?\" inquired Hester half impatiently. \"What have you come into my room for? Are you going into a fit of hysterics? You had better control yourself, for the dinner gong will sound directly.\"  Susan gasped two or three times, made a rush to Hester's wash-hand stand, and, taking up a glass, poured some cold water into it, and gulped it down.  \"Now I can speak,\" she said. \"I ran so fast that my breath quite left me. Hester, put on your walking things or go without them, just as you please--only go at once if you would save her.\"  \"Save whom?\" asked Hester.  \"Your little sister--little Nan. I--I saw it all. I was in the hammock, and nobody knew I was there, and somehow I wasn't so sleepy as usual, and I heard Nan's voice, and I looked over the side of the hammock, and she was sitting on the grass picking daisies, and her nurse was with her, and presently you came up. I heard you calling me, but I wasn't going to answer. I felt too comfortable. You stayed with Nan and her nurse for a little, and then went away; and I heard Nan's nurse say to her: 'Sit here, missy, till I come back to you; I am going to fetch another reel of sewing cotton from the house. Sit still, missy; I'll be back directly.' She went away, and Nan went on picking her daisies. All on a sudden I heard Nan give a sharp little cry, and I looked over the hammock, and there was a tall, dark woman, with such a wicked face, and she snatched up Nan in her arms, and put a thick shawl over her face, and ran off with her. It was all done in an instant. I shouted and I scrambled out of the hammock, and I rushed down the path; but there wasn't a sign of anybody there. I don't know where the woman went--it seemed as if the earth swallowed up both her and little Nan. Why, Hester, are you going to faint?\"  \"Water!\" gasped Hester--\"one sip--now let me go.\"     CHAPTER XL.  A GYPSY MAID.   In a few moments every one in Lavender House was made acquainted with Susan's story. At such a time ceremony was laid aside, dinner forgotten, teachers, pupils, servants all congregated in the grounds, all rushed to the spot where Nan's withered daisies still lay, all peered through the underwood, and all, alas! looked in vain for the tall dark woman and the little child. Little Nan, the baby of the school, had been stolen--there were loud and terrified lamentations. Nan's nurse was almost tearing her hair, was rushing frantically here, there, and everywhere. No one blamed the nurse for leaving her little charge in apparent safety for a few moments, but the poor woman's own distress was pitiable to see. Mrs. Willis took Hester's hand, and told the poor stunned girl that she was sending to Sefton immediately for two or three policemen, and that in the meantime every man on the place should commence the search for the woman and child.  \"Without any doubt,\" Mrs. Willis added, \"we shall soon have our little Nan back again; it is quite impossible that the woman, whoever she is, can have taken her so far away in so short a time.\"  In the meantime, Annie in her bedroom heard the fuss and the noise. She leaned out of her window and saw Phyllis in the distance; she called to her. Phyllis ran up, the tears streaming down her cheeks.  \"Oh, something so dreadful!\" she gasped; \"a wicked, wicked woman has stolen little Nan Thornton. She ran off with her just where the undergrowth is so thick at the end of the shady walk. It happened to her half an hour ago, and they are all looking, but they cannot find the woman or little Nan anywhere. Oh, it is so dreadful! Is that you, Mary?\"  Phyllis ran off to join her sister, and Annie put her head in again, and looked round her pretty room.  \"The gypsy,\" she murmured, \"the tall, dark gypsy has taken little Nan!\"  Her face was very white, her eyes shone, her lips expressed a firm and almost obstinate determination. With all her usual impulsiveness, she decided on a course of action--she snatched up a piece of paper and scribbled a hasty line:    \"DEAR MOTHER-FRIEND:--However badly you think of Annie, Annie loves   you with all her heart. Forgive me, I must go myself to look for   little Nan. That tall, dark woman is a gypsy--I have seen her   before; her name is Mother Rachel. Tell Hetty I won't return until   I bring her little sister back.--Your repentant and sorrowful                                                               ANNIE.\"  Annie twisted up the note, directed it to Mrs. Willis, and left it on her dressing-table.  Then, with a wonderful amount of forethought for her, she emptied the contents of a little purse into a tiny gingham bag, which she fastened inside the front of her dress. She put on her shady hat, and threw a shawl across her arm, and then, slipping softly downstairs, she went out through the deserted kitchens, down the back avenue, and past the laurel bush, until she came to the stile which led into the wood--she was going straight to the gypsies' encampment.  Annie, with some of the gypsy's characteristics in her own blood, had always taken an extraordinary interest in these queer wandering people. Gypsies had a fascination for her, she loved stories about them; if a gypsy encampment was near, she always begged the teachers to walk in that direction. Annie had a very vivid imagination, and in the days when she reigned as favorite in the school she used to make up stories for the express benefit of her companions. These stories, as a rule, always turned upon the gypsies. Many and many a time had the girls of Lavender House almost gasped with horror as Annie described the queer ways of these people. For her, personally, their wildness and their freedom had a certain fascination, and she was heard in her gayest moments to remark that she would rather like to be stolen and adopted by a gypsy tribe.  Whenever Annie had an opportunity, she chatted with the gypsy wives, and allowed them to tell her fortune, and listened eagerly to their narratives. When a little child she had once for several months been under the care of a nurse who was a reclaimed gypsy, and this girl had given her all kinds of information about them. Annie often felt that she quite loved these wild people, and Mother Rachel was the first gypsy she cordially shrank from and disliked.  When the little girl started now on her wild-goose chase after Nan, she was by no means devoid of a plan of action. The knowledge she had taken so many years to acquire came to her aid, and she determined to use it for Nan's benefit. She knew that the gypsies, with all their wandering and erratic habits, had a certain attachment, if not for homes, at least for sites; she knew that as a rule they encamped over and over again in the same place; she knew that their wanderings were conducted with method, and their apparently lawless lives governed by strict self-made rules.  Annie made straight now for the encampment, which stood in a little dell at the other side of the fairies' field. Here for weeks past the gypsies' tents had been seen; here the gypsy children had played, and the men and women smoked and lain about in the sun.  Annie entered the small field now, but uttered no exclamation of surprise when she found that all the tents, with the exception of one, had been removed, and that this tent also was being rapidly taken down by a man and a girl, while a tall boy stood by, holding a donkey by the bridle.  Annie wasted no time in looking for Nan here. Before the girl and the man could see her, she darted behind a bush, and removing her little bag of money, hid it carefully under some long grass; then she pulled a very bright yellow sash out of her pocket, tied it round her blue cotton dress, and leaving her little shawl also on the ground, tripped gaily up to the tent.  She saw with pleasure that the girl who was helping the man was about her own size. She went up and touched her on the shoulder.  \"Look here,\" she said, \"I want to make such a pretty play by-and-by--I want to play that I'm a gypsy girl. Will you give me your clothes, if I give you mine? See, mine are neat, and this sash is very handsome. Will you have them? Do. I am so anxious to play at being a gypsy.\"  The girl turned and stared. Annie's pretty blue print and gay sash were certainly tempting bait. She glanced at her father.  \"The little lady wants to change,\" she said in an eager voice.  The man nodded acquiescence, and the girl taking Annie's hand, ran quickly with her to the bottom of the field.  \"You don't mean it, surely?\" she said. \"Eh, but I'm uncommon willing.\"  \"Yes, I certainly mean it,\" said Annie. \"You are a dear, good, obliging girl, and how nice you will look in my pretty blue cotton! I like that striped petticoat of yours, too, and that gay handkerchief you wear round your shoulders. Thank you so very much. Now, do I look like a real, real gypsy?\"  \"Your hair ain't ragged enough, miss.\"  \"Oh, clip it, then; clip it away. I want to be quite the real thing. Have you got a pair of scissors?\"  The girl ran back to the tent, and presently returned to shear poor Annie's beautiful hair in truly rough fashion.  \"Now, miss, you look much more like, only your arms are a bit too white. Stay, we has got some walnut-juice; we was just a-using of it. I'll touch you up fine, miss.\"  So she did, darkening Annie's brown skin to a real gypsy tone.  \"You're a dear, good girl,\" said Annie, in conclusion; and as the girl's father called her roughly at this moment, she was obliged to go away, looking ungainly enough in the English child's neat clothes.     CHAPTER XLI.  DISGUISED.   Annie ran out of the field, mounted the stile which led into the wood, and stood there until the gypsy man and girl, and the boy with the donkey, had finally disappeared. Then she left her hiding-place, and taking her little gingham bag out of the long grass, secured it once more in the front of her dress. She felt queer and uncomfortable in her new dress, and the gypsy girl's heavy shoes tired her feet; but she was not to be turned from her purpose by any manner of discomforts, and she started bravely on her long trudge over the dusty roads, for her object was to follow the gypsies to their next encampment, about ten miles away. She had managed, with some tact, to obtain a certain amount of information from the delighted gypsy girl. The girl told Annie that she was very glad they were going from here; that this was a very dull place, and that they would not have stayed so long but for Mother Rachel, who, for some reasons of her own, had refused to stir.  Here the girl drew herself up short, and colored under her dark skin. But Annie's tact never failed. She even yawned a little, and seemed scarcely to hear the girl's words.  Now, in the distance, she followed these people.  In her disguise, uncomfortable as it was, she felt tolerably safe. Should any of the people in Lavender House happen to pass her on the way, they would never recognize Annie Forest in this small gypsy maiden. When she did approach the gypsies' dwelling she might have some hope of passing as one of themselves. The only one whom she had really to fear was the girl with whom she had changed clothes, and she trusted to her wits to keep out of this young person's way.  When Zillah, her old gypsy nurse, had charmed her long ago with gypsy legends and stories, Annie had always begged to hear about the fair English children whom the gypsies stole, and Zillah had let her into some secrets which partly accounted for the fact that so few of these children are ever recovered.  She walked very fast now; her depression was gone, a great excitement, a great longing, a great hope, keeping her up. She forgot that she had eaten nothing since breakfast; she forgot everything in all the world now but her great love for little Nan, and her desire to lay down her very life, if necessary, to rescue Nan from the terrible fate which awaited her if she was brought up as a gypsy's child.  Annie, however, was unaccustomed to such long walks, and besides, recent events had weakened her, and by the time she reached Sefton--for her road lay straight through this little town--she was so hot and thirsty that she looked around her anxiously to find some place of refreshment.  In an unconscious manner she paused before a restaurant, where she and several other girls of Lavender House had more than once been regaled with buns and milk.  The remembrance of the fresh milk and the nice buns came gratefully before the memory of the tired child now. Forgetting her queer attire, she went into the shop, and walked boldly up to the counter.  Annie's disguise, however, was good, and the young woman who was serving, instead of bending forward with the usual gracious \"What can I get for you, miss?\" said very sharply:  \"Go away at once, little girl; we don't allow beggars here; leave the shop instantly. No, I have nothing for you.\"  Annie was about to reply rather hotly, for she had an idea that even a gypsy's money might purchase buns and milk, when she was suddenly startled, and almost terrified into betraying herself, by encountering the gentle and fixed stare of Miss Jane Bruce, who had been leaning over the counter and talking to one of the shop-women when Annie entered.  \"Here is a penny for you, little girl,\" she said. \"You can get a nice hunch of stale bread for a penny in the shop at the corner of the High street.\"  Annie's eyes flashed back at the little lady, her lips quivered, and, clasping the penny, she rushed out of the shop.  \"My dear,\" said Miss Jane, turning to her sister, \"did you notice the extraordinary likeness that little gypsy girl bore to Annie Forest?\"  Miss Agnes sighed. \"Not particularly, love,\" she answered; \"but I scarcely looked at her. I wonder if our dear little Annie is any happier than she was. Ah, I think we have done here. Good-afternoon, Mrs. Tremlett.\"  The little old ladies trotted off, giving no more thoughts to the gypsy child.  Poor Annie almost ran down the street, and never paused till she reached a shop of much humbler appearance, where she was served with some cold slices of German sausage, some indifferent bread and butter, and milk by no means over-good. The coarse fare, and the rough people who surrounded her, made the poor child feel both sick and frightened. She found she could only keep up her character by remaining almost silent, for the moment she opened her lips people turned round and stared at her.  She paid for her meal, however, and presently found herself at the other side of Sefton, and in a part of the country which was comparatively strange to her. The gypsies' present encampment was about a mile away from the town of Oakley, a much larger place than Sefton. Sefton and Oakley lay about six miles apart. Annie trudged bravely on, her head aching; for, of course, as a gypsy girl, she could use no parasol to shade her from the sun. At last the comparative cool of the evening arrived, and the little girl gave a sigh of relief, and looked forward to her bed and supper at Oakley. She had made up her mind to sleep there, and to go to the gypsies' encampment very early in the morning. It was quite dark by the time she reached Oakley, and she was now so tired, and her feet so blistered from walking in the gypsy girl's rough shoes, that she could scarcely proceed another step. The noise and the size of Oakley, too, bewildered and frightened her. She had learned a lesson in Sefton, and dared not venture into the more respectable streets. How could she sleep in those hot, common, close houses? Surely it would be better for her to lie down under a cool hedgerow--there could be no real cold on this lovely summer's night, and the hours would quickly pass, and the time soon arrive when she must go boldly in search of Nan. She resolved to sleep in a hayfield which took her fancy just outside the town, and she only went into Oakley for the purpose of buying some bread and milk.  Annie was so far fortunate as to get a refreshing draught of really good milk from a woman who stood by a cottage door, and who gave her a piece of girdle-cake to eat with it.  \"You're one of the gypsies, my dear?\" said the woman. \"I saw them passing in their caravans an hour back. No doubt you are for taking up your old quarters in the copse, just alongside of Squire Thompson's long acre field. How is it you are not with the rest of them, child?\"  \"I was late in starting,\" said Annie. \"Can you tell me the best way to get from here to the long acre field?\"  \"Oh, you take that turnstile, child, and keep in the narrow path by the cornfields; it's two miles and a half from here as the crow flies. No, no, my dear, I don't want your pennies; but you might humor my little girl here by telling her fortune--she's wonderful taken by the gypsy folk.\"  Annie colored painfully. The child came forward, and she crossed her hand with a piece of silver. She looked at the little palm and muttered something about being rich and fortunate, and marrying a prince in disguise, and having no trouble whatever.  \"Eh! but that's a fine lot, is yours, Peggy,\" said the gratified mother.  Peggy, however, aged nine, had a wiser head on her young shoulders.  \"She didn't tell no proper fortune,\" she said disparagingly, when Annie left the cottage. \"She didn't speak about no crosses, and no biting disappointments, and no bleeding wounds. I don't believe in her, I don't. I like fortunes mixed, not all one way; them fortunes ain't natural, and I don't believe she's no proper gypsy girl.\"     CHAPTER XLII.  HESTER.   At Lavender House the confusion, the terror, and the dismay were great. For several hours the girls seemed quite to lose their heads, and just when, under Mrs. Willis' and the other teachers' calmness and determination, they were being restored to discipline and order, the excitement and alarm broke out afresh when some one brought Annie's little note to Mrs. Willis, and the school discovered that she also was missing.  On this occasion no one did doubt her motive; disobedient as her act was no one wasted words of blame on her. All, from the head-mistress to the smallest child in the school, knew that it was love for little Nan that had taken Annie off; and the tears started to Mrs. Willis' eyes when she first read the tiny note, and then placed it tenderly in her desk. Hester's face became almost ashen in its hue when she heard what Annie had done.  \"Annie has gone herself to bring back Nan to you, Hester,\" said Phyllis. \"It was I told her, and I know now by her face that she must have made up her mind at once.\"  \"Very disobedient of her to go,\" said Dora Russell; but no one took up Dora's tone, and Mary Price said, after a pause:  \"Disobedient or not, it was brave--it was really very plucky.\"  \"It is my opinion,\" said Nora, \"that if any one in the world can find little Nan it will be Annie. You remember, Phyllis, how often she has talked to us about gypsies, and what a lot she knows about them?\"  \"Oh, yes; she'll be better than fifty policemen,\" echoed several girls; and then two or three young faces were turned toward Hester, and some voice said almost scornfully:  \"You'll have to love Annie now; you'll have to admit that there is something good in our Annie when she brings your little Nan home again.\"  Hester's lip quivered; she tried to speak, but a sudden burst of tears came from her instead. She walked slowly out of the astonished little group, who none of them believed that proud Hester Thornton could weep.  The wretched girl rushed up to her room, where she threw herself on her bed and gave way to some of the bitterest tears she had ever shed. All her indifference to Annie, all her real unkindness, all her ever-increasing dislike came back now to torture and harass her. She began to believe with the girls that Annie would be successful; she began dimly to acknowledge in her heart the strange power which this child possessed; she guessed that Annie would heap coals of fire on her head by bringing back her little sister. She hoped, she longed, she could almost have found it in her heart to pray that some one else, not Annie, might save little Nan.  For not yet had Hester made up her mind to confess the truth about Annie Forest. To confess the truth now meant humiliation in the eyes of the whole school. Even for Nan's sake she could not, she would not be great enough for this.  Sobbing on her bed, trembling from head to foot, in an agony of almost uncontrollable grief, she could not bring her proud and stubborn little heart to accept God's only way of peace. No, she hoped she might be able to influence Susan Drummond and induce her to confess, and if Annie was not cleared in that way, if she really saved little Nan, she would doubtless be restored to much of her lost favor in the school.  Hester had never been a favorite at Lavender House; but now her great trouble caused all the girls to speak to her kindly and considerately, and as she lay on her bed she presently heard a gentle step on the floor of her room--a cool little hand was laid tenderly on her forehead, and opening her swollen eyes, she met Cecil's loving gaze.  \"There is no news yet, Hester,\" said Cecil; \"but Mrs. Willis has just gone herself into Sefton, and will not lose an hour in getting further help. Mrs. Willis looks quite haggard. Of course she is very anxious both about Annie and Nan.\"  \"Oh, Annie is safe enough,\" murmured Hester, burying her head in the bed-clothes.  \"I don't know; Annie is very impulsive and very pretty; the gypsies may like to steal her too--of course she has gone straight to one of their encampments. Naturally Mrs. Willis is most anxious.\"  Hester pressed her hand to her throbbing head.  \"We are all so sorry for you, dear,\" said Cecil gently.  \"Thank you--being sorry for one does not do a great deal of good, does it?\"  \"I thought sympathy always did good,\" replied Cecil, looking puzzled.  \"Thank you,\" said Hester again. She lay quite still for several minutes with her eyes closed. Her face looked intensely unhappy. Cecil was not easily repelled and she guessed only too surely that Hester's proud heart was suffering much. She was puzzled, however, how to approach her, and had almost made up her mind to go away and beg of kind-hearted Miss Danesbury to see if she could come and do something, when through the open window there came the shrill sweet laughter and the eager, high-pitched tones of some of the youngest children in the school. A strange quiver passed over Hester's face at the sound; she sat up in bed, and gasped out in a half-strangled voice:  \"Oh! I can't bear it--little Nan, little Nan! Cecil, I am very, very unhappy.\"  \"I know it, darling,\" said Cecil, and she put her arms round the excited girl. \"Oh, Hester! don't turn away from me; do let us be unhappy together.\"  \"But you did not care for Nan.\"  \"I did--we all loved the pretty darling.\"  \"Suppose I never see her again?\" said Hester half wildly. \"Oh, Cecil! and mother left her to me! mother gave her to me to take care of, and to bring to her some day in heaven. Oh, little Nan, my pretty, my love, my sweet! I think I could better bear her being dead than this.\"  \"You could, Hester,\" said Cecil, \"if she was never to be found; but I don't think God will give you such a terrible punishment. I think little Nan will be restored to you. Let us ask God to do it, Hetty--let us kneel down now, we two little girls, and pray to Him with all our might.\"  \"I can't pray; don't ask me,\" said Hester, turning her face away.  \"Then I will.\"  \"But not here, Cecil. Cecil, I am not good--I am not good enough to pray.\"  \"We don't want to be good to pray,\" said Cecil. \"We want perhaps to be unhappy--perhaps sorry; but if God waited just for goodness, I don't think He would get many prayers.\"  \"Well, I am unhappy, but not sorry. No, no; don't ask me, I cannot pray.\"     CHAPTER XLIII.  SUSAN.   Mrs. Willis came back at a very late hour from Sefton. The police were confident that they must soon discover both children, but no tidings had yet been heard of either of them. Mrs. Willis ordered her girls to bed, and went herself to kiss Hester and give her a special \"good-night.\" She was struck by the peculiarly unhappy, and even hardened, expression on the poor child's face, and felt that she did not half understand her.  In the middle of the night Hester awoke from a troubled dream. She awoke with a sharp cry, so sharp and intense in its sound that had any girl been awake in the next room she must have heard it. She felt that she could no longer remain close to that little empty cot. She suddenly remembered that Susan Drummond would be alone to-night: what time so good as the present for having a long talk with Susan and getting her to clear Annie? She slipped out of bed, put on her dressing-gown, and softly opening the door, ran down the passage to Susan's room.  Susan was in bed, and fast asleep. Hester could see her face quite plainly in the moonlight, for Susan slept facing the window, and the blind was not drawn down.  Hester had some difficulty in awakening Miss Drummond, who, however, at last sat up in bed yawning prodigiously.  \"What is the matter? Is that you, Hester Thornton? Have you got any news of little Nan? Has Annie come back?\"  \"No, they are both still away. Susy, I want to speak to you.\"  \"Dear me! what for? must you speak in the middle of the night?\"  \"Yes, for I don't want any one else to know. Oh, Susan, please don't go to sleep.\"  \"My dear, I won't, if I can help it. Do you mind throwing a little cold water over my face and head? There is a can by the bedside. I always keep one handy. Ah, thanks--now I am wide awake. I shall probably remain so for about two minutes. Can you get your say over in that time?\"  \"I wonder, Susan,\" said Hester, \"if you have got any heart--but heart or not, I have just come here to-night to tell you that I have found you out. You are at the bottom of all this mischief about Annie Forest.\"  Susan had a most phlegmatic face, an utterly unemotional voice, and she now stared calmly at Hester and demanded to know what in the world she meant.  Hester felt her temper going, her self-control deserting her. Susan's apparent innocence and indifference drove her half frantic.  \"Oh, you are mean,\" she said. \"You pretend to be innocent, but you are the deepest and wickedest girl in the school. I tell you, Susan, I have found you out--you put that caricature of Mrs. Willis into Cecil's book; you changed Dora's theme. I don't know why you did it, nor how you did it, but you are the guilty person, and you have allowed the sin of it to remain on Annie's shoulders all this time. Oh, you are the very meanest girl I ever heard of!\"  \"Dear, dear!\" said Susan, \"I wish I had not asked you to throw cold water over my head and face, and allow myself to be made very wet and uncomfortable, just to be told I am the meanest girl you ever met. And pray what affair is this of yours? You certainly don't love Annie Forest.\"  \"I don't, but I want justice to be done to her. Annie is very, very unhappy. Oh, Susy, won't you go and tell Mrs. Willis the truth?\"  \"Really, my dear Hester, I think you are a little mad. How long have you known all this about me, pray?\"  \"Oh, for some time; since--since the night the essay was changed.\"  \"Ah, then, if what you state is true, you told Mrs. Willis a lie, for she distinctly asked you if you knew anything about the 'Muddy Stream,' and you said you didn't. I saw you--I remarked how very red you got when you plumped out that great lie! My dear, if I am the meanest and wickedest girl in the school, prove it--go, tell Mrs. Willis what you know. Now, if you will allow me, I will get back into the land of dreams.\"  Susan curled herself up once more in her bed, wrapped the bed-clothes tightly round her and was, to all appearance, oblivious of Hester's presence.     CHAPTER XLIV.  UNDER THE HEDGE.   It is one thing to talk of the delights of sleeping under a hedgerow, and another to realize them. A hayfield is a very charming place, but in the middle of the night, with the dew clinging to everything, it is apt to prove but a chilly bed; the most familiar objects put on strange and unreal forms, the most familiar sounds become loud and alarming. Annie slept for about an hour soundly; then she awoke, trembling with cold in every limb, startled, and almost terrified by the oppressive loneliness of the night, sure that the insect life which surrounded her, and which would keep up successions of chirps, and croaks, and buzzes, was something mysterious and terrifying. Annie was a brave child, but even brave little girls may be allowed to possess nerves under her present conditions, and when a spider ran across her face she started up with a scream of terror. At this moment she almost regretted the close and dirty lodgings which she might have obtained for a few pence at Oakley. The hay in the field which she had selected was partly cut and partly standing. The cut portion had been piled up into little cocks and hillocks, and these, with the night shadows round them, appeared to the frightened child to assume large and half-human proportions. She found she could not sleep any longer. She wrapped her shawl tightly round her, and, crouching into the hedgerow, waited for the dawn.  That watched-for dawn seemed to the tired child as if it would never come; but at last her solitary vigil came to an end, the cold grew greater, a little gentle breeze stirred the uncut grass, and up in the sky overhead the stars became fainter and the atmosphere clearer. Then came a little faint flush of pink, then a brighter light, and then all in a moment the birds burst into a perfect jubilee of song, the insects talked and chirped and buzzed in new tones, the hay-cocks became simply hay-cocks, the dew sparkled on the wet grass, the sun had risen, and the new day had begun.  Annie sat up and rubbed her tired eyes. With the sunshine and brightness her versatile spirits revived; she buckled on her courage like an armor, and almost laughed at the miseries of the past few hours. Once more she believed that success and victory would be hers, once more in her small way she was ready to do or die. She believed absolutely in the holiness of her mission. Love--love alone, simple and pure, was guiding her. She gave no thought to after-consequences, she gave no memory to past events: her object now was to rescue Nan, and she herself was nothing.  Annie had a fellow-feeling, a rare sympathy with every little child; but no child had ever come to take Nan's place with her. The child she had first begun to notice simply out of a naughty spirit of revenge, had twined herself round her heart, and Annie loved Nan all the more dearly because she had long ago repented of stealing her affections from Hester, and would gladly have restored her to her old place next to Hetty's heart. Her love for Nan, therefore, had the purity and greatness which all love that calls forth self-sacrifice must possess. Annie had denied herself, and kept away from Nan of late. Now, indeed, she was going to rescue her; but if she thought of herself at all, it was with the certainty that for this present act of disobedience Mrs. Willis would dismiss her from the school, and she would not see little Nan again.  Never mind that, if Nan herself was saved. Annie was disobedient, but on this occasion she was not unhappy; she had none of that remorse which troubled her so much after her wild picnic in the fairies' field. On the contrary, she had a strange sense of peace and even guidance; she had confessed this sin to Mrs. Willis, and, though she was suspected of far worse, her own innocence kept her heart untroubled. The verse which had occurred to her two mornings before still rang in her ears:              \"A soul which has sinned and is pardoned again.\"  The impulsive, eager child was possessed just now of something which men call True Courage; it was founded on the knowledge that God would help her, and was accordingly calm and strengthening.  Annie rose from her damp bed, and looked around her for a little stream where she might wash her face and hands; suddenly she remembered that face and hands were dyed, and that she would do best to leave them alone. She smoothed out as best she could the ragged elf-locks which the gypsy maid had left on her curly head, and then covering her face with her hands, said simply and earnestly:  \"Please, my Father in heaven, help me to find little Nan;\" then she set off through the cornfields in the direction of the gypsies' encampment.     CHAPTER XLV.  TIGER.   It was still very, very early in the morning, and the gypsy folk, tired from their march on the preceding day, slept. There stood the conical, queer-shaped tents, four in number; at a little distance off grazed the donkeys and a couple of rough mules; at the door of the tents lay stretched out in profound repose two or three dogs.  Annie dreaded the barking of the dogs, although she guessed that if they set up a noise, and a gypsy wife or man put out their heads in consequence, they would only desire the gypsy child to lie down and keep quiet.  She stood still for a moment--she was very anxious to prowl around the place and examine the ground while the gypsies still slept, but the watchful dogs deterred her. She stood perfectly quiet behind the hedgerow, thinking hard. Should she trust to a charm she knew she possessed, and venture into the encampment? Annie had almost as great a fascination over dogs and cats as she had over children. As a little child going to visit with her mother at strange houses, the watch-dogs never barked at her; on the contrary, they yielded to the charm which seemed to come from her little fingers as she patted their great heads. Slowly their tails would move backward and forward as she patted them, and even the most ferocious would look at her with affection.  Annie wondered if the gypsy dogs would now allow her to approach without barking. She felt that the chances were in her favor; she was dressed in gypsy garments, there would be nothing strange in her appearance, and if she could get near one of the dogs she knew that she could exercise the magic of her touch.  Her object, then, was to approach one of the tents very, very quietly--so softly that even the dog's ears should not detect the light footfall. If she could approach close enough to put her hand on the dog's neck all would be well. She pulled off the gypsy maid's rough shoes, hid them in the grass where she could find them again, and came gingerly step by step, nearer and nearer the principal tent. At its entrance lay a ferocious-looking half-bred bull-dog. Annie possessed that necessary accompaniment to courage--great outward calm; the greater the danger, the more cool and self-possessed did she become. She was within a step or two of the tent when she trod accidentally on a small twig; it cracked, giving her foot a sharp pain, and very slight as the sound was, causing the bull-dog to awake. He raised his wicked face, saw the figure like his own people, and yet unlike, but a step or two away, and, uttering a low growl, sprang forward.  In the ordinary course of things this growl would have risen in volume and would have terminated in a volley of barking; but Annie was prepared: she went down on her knees, held out her arms, said, \"Poor fellow!\" in her own seductive voice, and the bull-dog fawned at her feet. He licked one of her hands while she patted him gently with the other.  \"Come, poor fellow,\" she said then in a gentle tone, and Annie and the dog began to perambulate round the tents.  The other dogs raised sleepy eyes, but seeing Tiger and the girl together, took no notice whatever, except by a thwack or two of their stumpy tails. Annie was now looking not only at the tents, but for something else which Zillah, her nurse, had told her might be found near to many gypsy encampments. This was a small subterranean passage, which generally led into a long-disused underground Danish fort. Zillah had told her what uses the gypsies liked to make of these underground passages, and how they often chose those which had two entrances. She told her that in this way they eluded the police, and were enabled successfully to hide the goods which they stole. She had also described to her their great ingenuity in hiding the entrances to these underground retreats.  Annie's idea now was that little Nan was hidden in one of these vaults, and she determined first to make sure of its existence, and then to venture herself into this underground region in search of the lost child.  She had made a decided conquest in the person of Tiger, who followed her round and round the tents, and when the gypsies at last began to stir, and Annie crept into the hedgerow, the dog crouched by her side. Tiger was the favorite dog of the camp, and presently one of the men called to him; he rose unwillingly, looked back with longing eyes at Annie, and trotted off, to return in the space of about five minutes with a great hunch of broken bread in his mouth. This was his breakfast, and he meant to share it with his new friend. Annie was too hungry to be fastidious, and she also knew the necessity of keeping up her strength. She crept still farther under the hedge, and the dog and girl shared the broken bread between them.  Presently the tents were all astir; the gypsy children began to swarm about, the women lit fires in the open air, and the smell of very appetizing breakfasts filled the atmosphere. The men also lounged into view, standing lazily at the doors of their tents, and smoking great pipes of tobacco. Annie lay quiet. She could see from her hiding-place without being seen. Suddenly--and her eyes began to dilate, and she found her heart beating strangely--she laid her hand on Tiger, who was quivering all over.  \"Stay with me, dear dog,\" she said.  There was a great commotion and excitement in the gypsy camp; the children screamed and ran into the tents, the women paused in their preparation for breakfast, the men took their short pipes out of their mouths; every dog, with the exception of Tiger, barked ferociously. Tiger and Annie alone were motionless.  The cause of all this uproar was a body of police, about six in number, who came boldly into the field, and demanded instantly to search the tents.  \"We want a woman who calls herself Mother Rachel,\" they said. \"She belongs to this encampment. We know her; let her come forward at once; we wish to question her.\"  The men stood about; the women came near; the children crept out of their tents, placing their fingers to their frightened lips, and staring at the men who represented those horrors to their unsophisticated minds called Law and Order.  \"We must search the tents. We won't stir from the spot until we have had an interview with Mother Rachel,\" said the principal member of the police force.  The men answered respectfully that the gypsy mother was not yet up; but if the gentlemen would wait a moment she would soon come and speak to them.  The officers expressed their willingness to wait, and collected round the tents.  Just at this instant, under the hedgerow, Tiger raised his head. Annie's watchful eyes accompanied the dog's. He was gazing after a tiny gypsy maid who was skulking along the hedge, and who presently disappeared through a very small opening into the neighboring field.  Quick as thought Annie, holding Tiger's collar, darted after her. The little maid heard the footsteps; but seeing another gypsy girl, and their own dog, Tiger, she took no further notice, but ran openly and very swiftly across the field until she came to a broken wall. Here she tugged and tugged at some loose stones, managed to push one away, and then called down into the ground:  \"Mother Rachel!\"  \"Come, Tiger,\" said Annie. She flew to a hedge not far off, and once more the dog and she hid themselves. The small girl was too excited to notice either their coming or going; she went on calling anxiously into the ground:  \"Mother Rachel! Mother Rachel!\"  Presently a black head and a pair of brawny shoulders appeared, and the tall woman whose face and figure Annie knew so well stepped up out of the ground, pushed back the stones into their place, and, taking the gypsy child into her arms, ran swiftly across the field in the direction of the tents.     CHAPTER XLVI.  FOR LOVE OF NAN.   Now was Annie's time. \"Tiger,\" she said, for she had heard the men calling the dog's name, \"I want to go right down into that hole in the ground, and you are to come with me. Don't let us lose a moment, good dog.\"  The dog wagged his tail, capered about in front of Annie, and then with a wonderful shrewdness ran before her to the broken wall, where he stood with his head bent downward and his eyes fixed on the ground.  Annie pulled and tugged at the loose stones; they were so heavy and cunningly arranged that she wondered how the little maid, who was smaller than herself, had managed to remove them. She saw quickly, however, that they were arranged with a certain leverage, and that the largest stone, that which formed the real entrance to the underground passage, was balanced in its place in such a fashion that when she leaned on a certain portion of it, it moved aside, and allowed plenty of room for her to go down into the earth.  Very dark and dismal and uninviting did the rude steps, which led nobody knew where, appear. For one moment Annie hesitated; but the thought of Nan hidden somewhere in this awful wretchedness nerved her courage.  \"Go first, Tiger, please,\" she said, and the dog scampered down, sniffing the earth as he went. Annie followed him, but she had scarcely got her head below the level of the ground before she found herself in total and absolute darkness; she had unwittingly touched the heavy stone, which had swung back into its place. She heard Tiger sniffing below, and, calling him to keep by her side, she went very carefully down and down and down, until at last she knew by the increase of air that she must have come to the end of the narrow entrance passage.  She was now able to stand upright, and raising her hand, she tried in vain to find a roof. The room where she stood, then, must be lofty. She went forward in the utter darkness very, very slowly; suddenly her head again came in contact with the roof; she made a few steps farther on, and then found that to proceed at all she must go on her hands and knees. She bent down and peered through the darkness.  \"We'll go on, Tiger,\" she said, and, holding the dog's collar and clinging to him for protection, she crept along the narrow passage.  Suddenly she gave an exclamation of joy--at the other end of this gloomy passage was light--faint twilight surely, but still undoubted light, which came down from some chink in the outer world. Annie came to the end of the passage, and, standing upright, found herself suddenly in a room; a very small and miserable room certainly, but with the twilight shining through it, which revealed not only that it was a room, but a room which contained a heap of straw, a three-legged stool, and two or three cracked cups and saucers. Here, then, was Mother Rachel's lair, and here she must look for Nan.  The darkness had been so intense that even the faint twilight of this little chamber had dazzled Annie's eyes for a moment; the next, however, her vision became clear. She saw that the straw bed contained a bundle; she went near--out of the wrapped-up bundle of shawls appeared the head of a child. The child slept, and moaned in its slumbers.  Annie bent over it and said, \"Thank God!\" in a tone of rapture, and then, stooping down, she passionately kissed the lips of little Nan.  Nan's skin had been dyed with the walnut-juice, her pretty, soft hair had been cut short, her dainty clothes had been changed for the most ragged gipsy garments, but still she was undoubtedly Nan, the child whom Annie had come to save.  From her uneasy slumbers the poor little one awoke with a cry of terror. She could not recognize Annie's changed face, and clasped her hands before her eyes, and said piteously:  \"Me want to go home--go 'way, naughty woman, me want my Annie.\"  \"Little darling!\" said Annie, in her sweetest tones. The changed face had not appealed to Nan, but the old voice went straight to her baby heart; she stopped crying and looked anxiously toward the entrance of the room.  \"Tum in, Annie--me here, Annie--little Nan want 'oo.\"  Annie glanced around her in despair. Suddenly her quick eyes lighted on a jug of water; she flew to it, and washed and laved her face.  \"Coming, darling,\" she said, as she tried to remove the hateful dye. She succeeded partly, and when she came back, to her great joy, the child recognized her.  \"Now, little precious, we will get out of this as fast as we can,\" said Annie, and, clasping Nan tightly in her arms, she prepared to return by the way she had come. Then and there, for the first time, there flashed across her memory the horrible fact that the stone door had swung back into its place, and that by no possible means could she open it. She and Nan and Tiger were buried in a living tomb, and must either stay there and perish, or await the tender mercies of the cruel Mother Rachel.  Nan, with her arms tightly clasped round Annie's neck, began to cry fretfully. She was impatient to get out of this dismal place; she was no longer oppressed by fears, for with the Annie whom she loved she felt absolutely safe; but she was hungry and cold and uncomfortable, and it seemed but a step, to little inexperienced Nan, from Annie's arms to her snug, cheerful nursery at Lavender House.  \"Tum, Annie--tum home, Annie,\" she begged and, when Annie did not stir, she began to weep.  In truth, the poor, brave little girl was sadly puzzled, and her first gleam of returning hope lay in the remembrance of Zillah's words, that there were generally two entrances to these old underground forts. Tiger, who seemed thoroughly at home in this little room, and had curled himself up comfortably on the heap of straw, had probably often been here before. Perhaps Tiger knew the way to the second entrance. Annie called him to her side.  \"Tiger,\" she said, going down on her knees, and looking full into his ugly but intelligent face, \"Nan and I want to go out of this.\"  Tiger wagged his stumpy tail.  \"We are hungry, Tiger, and we want something to eat, and you'd like a bone, wouldn't you?\"  Tiger's tail went with ferocious speed, and he licked Annie's hand.  \"There's no use going back that way, dear dog,\" continued the girl, pointing with her arm in the direction they had come. \"The door is fastened, Tiger, and we can't get out. We can't get out because the door is shut.\"  The dog's tail had ceased to wag; he took in the situation, for his whole expression showed dejection, and he drooped his head.  It was now quite evident to Annie that Tiger had been here before, and that on some other occasion in his life he had wanted to get out and could not because the door was shut.  \"Now, Tiger,\" said Annie, speaking cheerfully, and rising to her feet, \"we must get out. Nan and I are hungry, and you want your bone. Take us out the other way, good Tiger--the other way, dear dog.\"  She moved instantly toward the little passage; the dog followed her.  \"The other way,\" she said, and she turned her back on the long narrow passage, and took a step or two into complete darkness. The dog began to whine, caught hold of her dress, and tried to pull her back.  \"Quite right, Tiger, we won't go that way,\" said Annie, instantly. She returned into the dimly-lighted room.  \"Find a way--find a way out, Tiger,\" she said.  The dog evidently understood her; he moved restlessly about the room. Finally he got up on the bed, pulled and scratched and tore away the straw at the upper end, then, wagging his tail, flew to Annie's side. She came back with him. Beneath the straw was a tiny, tiny trap-door.  \"Oh, Tiger!\" said the girl; she went down on her knees, and, finding she could not stir it, wondered if this also was kept in its place by a system of balancing. She was right; after a very little pressing the door moved aside, and Annie saw four or five rudely carved steps.  \"Come, Nan,\" she said joyfully, \"Tiger has saved us; these steps must lead us out.\"  The dog, with a joyful whine, went down first, and Annie, clasping Nan tightly in her arms, followed him. Four, five, six steps they went down; then, to Annie's great joy, she found that the next step began to ascend. Up and up she went, cheered by a welcome shaft of light. Finally she, Nan, and the dog found themselves emerging into the open air, through a hole which might have been taken for a large rabbit burrow.     CHAPTER XLVII.  RESCUED.   The girl, the child, and the dog found themselves in a comparatively strange country--Annie had completely lost her bearings. She looked around her for some sign of the gypsies' encampment; but whether she had really gone a greater distance than she imagined in those underground vaults, or whether the tents were hidden in some hollow of the ground, she did not know; she was only conscious that she was in a strange country, that Nan was clinging to her and crying for her breakfast, and that Tiger was sniffing the air anxiously. Annie guessed that Tiger could take them back to the camp, but this was by no means her wish. When she emerged out of the underground passage she was conscious for the first time of a strange and unknown experience. Absolute terror seized the brave child; she trembled from head to foot, her head ached violently, and the ground on which she stood seemed to reel, and the sky to turn round. She sat down for a moment on the green grass. What ailed her? where was she? how could she get home? Nan's little piteous wail, \"Me want my bekfas', me want my nursie, me want Hetty,\" almost irritated her.  \"Oh, Nan,\" she said at last piteously, \"have you not got your own Annie? Oh, Nan, dear little Nan, Annie feels so ill!\"  Nan had the biggest and softest of baby hearts--breakfast, nurse, Hetty, were all forgotten in the crowning desire to comfort Annie. She climbed on her knee and stroked her face and kissed her lips.  \"'Oo better now?\" she said in a tone of baby inquiry.  Annie roused herself with a great effort.  \"Yes, darling,\" she said; \"we will try and get home. Come, Tiger. Tiger, dear, I don't want to go back to the gypsies; take me the other way--take me to Oakley.\"  Tiger again sniffed the air, looked anxiously at Annie, and trotted on in front. Little Nan in her ragged gypsy clothes walked sedately by Annie's side.  \"Where 'oo s'oes?\" she said, pointing to the girl's bare feet.  \"Gone, Nan--gone. Never mind, I've got you. My little treasure, my little love, you're safe at last.\"  As Annie tottered, rather than walked, down a narrow path which led directly through a field of standing corn, she was startled by the sudden apparition of a bright-eyed girl, who appeared so suddenly in her path that she might have been supposed to have risen out of the very ground.  The girl stared hard at Annie, fixed her eyes inquiringly on Nan and Tiger, and then turning on her heel, dashed up the path, went through a turnstile, across the road, and into a cottage.  \"Mother,\" she exclaimed, \"I said she warn't a real gypsy; she's a-coming back, and her face is all streaked like, and she has a little'un along with her, and a dawg, and the only one as is gypsy is the dawg. Come and look at her, mother; oh, she is a fine take-in!\"  The round-faced, good-humored looking mother, whose name was Mrs. Williams, had been washing and putting away the breakfast things when her daughter entered. She now wiped her hands hastily and came to the cottage door.  \"Cross the road, and come to the stile, mother,\" said the energetic Peggy--\"oh, there she be a-creeping along--oh, ain't she a take-in?\"  \"'Sakes alive!\" ejaculated Mrs. Williams, \"the girl is ill! why, she can't keep herself steady! There! I knew she'd fall; ah! poor little thing--poor little thing.\"  It did not take Mrs. Williams an instant to reach Annie's side; and in another moment she had lifted her in her strong arms and carried her into the cottage, Peggy lifting Nan and following in the rear, while Tiger walked by their sides.     CHAPTER XLVIII.  DARK DAYS.   A whole week had passed, and there were no tidings whatever of little Nan or of Annie Forest. No one at Lavender House had heard a word about them; the police came and went, detectives even arrived from London, but there were no traces whatever of the missing children.  The midsummer holiday was now close at hand, but no one spoke of it or thought of it. Mrs. Willis told the teachers that the prizes should be distributed, but she said she could invite no guests and could allow of no special festivities. Miss Danesbury and Miss Good repeated her words to the schoolgirls, who answered without hesitation that they did not wish for feasting and merriment; they would rather the day passed unnoticed. In truth, the fact that their baby was gone, that their favorite and prettiest and brightest schoolmate had also disappeared, caused such gloom, such distress, such apprehension that even the most thoughtless of those girls could scarcely have laughed or been merry. School-hours were still kept after a fashion, but there was no life in the lessons. In truth, it seemed as if the sun would never shine again at Lavender House.  Hester was ill; not very ill--she had no fever, she had no cold; she had, as the good doctor explained it, nothing at all wrong, except that her nervous system had got a shock.  \"When the little one is found, Miss Hetty will be quite well again,\" said the good doctor; but the little one had not been found yet, and Hester had completely broken down. She lay on her bed, saying little or nothing, eating scarcely anything, sleeping not at all. All the girls were kind to her and each one in the school took turns in trying to comfort her; but no one could win a smile from Hester, and even Mrs. Willis failed utterly to reach or touch her heart.  Mr. Everard came once to see her, but he had scarcely spoken many words when Hester broke into an agony of weeping and begged him to go away. He shook his head when he left her and said sadly to himself:  \"That girl has got something on her mind; she is grieving for more than the loss of her little sister.\"  The twentieth of June came at last, and the girls sat about in groups in the pleasant shady garden, and talked of the very sad breaking-up day they were to have on the morrow, and wondered if, when they returned to school again, Annie and little Nan would have been found. Cecil Temple, Dora Russell, and one or two others were sitting together and whispering in low voices. Mary Price joined them, and said anxiously:  \"I don't think the doctor is satisfied about Hester, Perhaps I ought not to have listened, but I heard him talking to Miss Danesbury just now; he said she must be got to sleep somehow, and she is to have a composing draught to-night.\"  \"I wish poor Hetty would not turn away from us all,\" said Cecil; \"I wish she would not quite give up hope; I do feel sure that Nan and Annie will be found yet.\"  \"Have you been praying about it, Cecil?\" asked Mary, kneeling on the grass, laying her elbows on Cecil's knees and looking into her face. \"Do you say this because you have faith?\"  \"I have prayed and I have faith,\" replied Cecil in her simple, earnest way. \"Why, Dora, what is the matter?\"  \"Only that it's horrid to leave like this,\" said Dora; \"I--I thought my last day at school would have been so different and somehow I am sorry I spoke so much against that poor little Annie.\"  Here Cecil suddenly rose from her seat, and going up to Dora, clasped her arms round her neck.  \"Thank you, Dora,\" she said with fervor; \"I love you for those words.\"  \"Here comes Susy,\" remarked Mary Price. \"I really don't think _anything_ would move Susy; she's just as stolid and indifferent as ever. Ah, Susy, here's a place for you--oh, what _is_ the matter with Phyllis? see how she's rushing toward us! Phyllis, my dear, don't break your neck.\"  Susan, with her usual nonchalance, seated herself by Dora Russell's side. Phyllis burst excitedly into the group.  \"I think,\" she exclaimed, \"I really, really do think that news has come of Annie's father. Nora said that Janet told her that a foreign letter came this morning to Mrs. Willis, and somebody saw Mrs. Willis talking to Miss Danesbury--oh, I forgot, only I know that the girls of the school are whispering the news that Mrs. Willis cried, and Miss Danesbury said, 'After waiting for him four years, and now, when he comes back, he won't find her!' Oh dear, oh dear! there is Danesbury. Cecil, darling love, go to her, and find out the truth.\"  Cecil rose at once, went across the lawn, said a few words to Miss Danesbury, and came back to the other girls.  \"It is true,\" she said sadly, \"there came a letter this morning from Captain Forest; he will be at Lavender House in a week. Miss Danesbury says it is a wonderful letter, and he has been shipwrecked, and on an island by himself for ever so long; but he is safe now, and will soon be in England. Miss Danesbury says Mrs. Willis can scarcely speak about that letter; she is in great, great trouble, and Miss Danesbury confesses that they are all more anxious than they dare to admit about Annie and little Nan.\"  At this moment the sound of carriage wheels was heard on the drive, and Susan, peering forward to see who was arriving, remarked in her usual nonchalant manner:  \"Only the little Misses Bruce in their basket-carriage--what dull-looking women they are?\"  Nobody commented, however, on her observation, and gradually the little group of girls sank into absolute silence.  From where they sat they could see the basket-carriage waiting at the front entrance--the little ladies had gone inside, all was perfect silence and stillness.  Suddenly on the stillness a sound broke--the sound of a girl running quickly; nearer and nearer came the steps, and the four or five who sat together under the oak-tree noticed the quick panting breath, and felt even before a word was uttered that evil tidings were coming to them. They all started to their feet, however; they all uttered a cry of horror and distress when Hester herself broke into their midst. She was supposed to be lying down in a darkened room, she was supposed to be very ill--what was she doing here?  \"Hetty!\" exclaimed Cecil.  Hester pushed past her; she rushed up to Susan Drummond, and seized her arm.  \"News has come!\" she panted; \"news--news at last! Nan is found!--and Annie--they are both found--but Annie is dying. Come, Susan, come this moment; we must both tell what we know now.\"  By her impetuosity, by the intense fire of her passion and agony, even Susan was electrified into leaving her seat and going with her.     CHAPTER XLIX.  TWO CONFESSIONS.   Hester dragged her startled and rather unwilling companion in through the front entrance, past some agitated-looking servants who stood about in the hall, and through the velvet curtains into Mrs. Willis' boudoir.  The Misses Bruce were there, and Mrs. Willis in her bonnet and cloak was hastily packing some things into a basket.  \"I--I must speak to you,\" said Hester, going up to her governess. \"Susan and I have got something to say, and we must say it here, now at once.\"  \"No, not now, Hester,\" replied Mrs. Willis, looking for a moment into her pupil's agitated face. \"Whatever you and Susan Drummond have to tell cannot be listened to by me at this moment. I have not an instant to lose.\"  \"You are going to Annie?\" asked Hester.  \"Yes; don't keep me. Good-bye, my dears; good-bye.\"  Mrs. Willis moved toward the door. Hester, who felt almost beside herself, rushed after her, and caught her arm.  \"Take us with you, take Susy and me with you--we must, we must see Annie before she dies.\"  \"Hush, my child,\" said Mrs. Willis very quietly; \"try to calm yourself. Whatever you have got to say shall be listened to later on--now moments are precious, and I cannot attend to you. Calm yourself, Hester, and thank God for your dear little sister's safety. Prepare yourself to receive her, for the carriage which takes me to Annie will bring little Nan home.\"  Mrs. Willis left the room, and Hester threw herself on her knees and covered her face with her trembling hands. Presently she was aroused by a light touch on her arm; it was Susan Drummond.  \"I may go now I suppose, Hester? You are not quite determined to make a fool of me, are you?\"  \"I have determined to expose you, you coward; you mean, mean girl!\" answered Hester, springing to her feet. \"Come, I have no idea of letting you go. Mrs. Willis won't listen--we will find Mr. Everard.\"  Whether Susan would really have gone with Heater remains to be proved, but just at that moment all possibility of retreat was cut away from her by Miss Agnes Bruce, who quietly entered Mrs. Willis' private sitting-room, followed by the very man Hester was about to seek.  \"I thought it best, my dear,\" she said, turning apologetically to Hester, \"to go at once for our good clergyman; you can tell him all that is in your heart, and I will leave you. Before I go, however, I should like to tell you how I found Annie and little Nan.\"  Hester made no answer; just for a brief moment she raised her eyes to Miss Agnes' kind face, then they sought the floor.  \"The story can be told in a few words, dear,\" said the little lady. \"A workwoman of the name of Williams, whom my sister and I have employed for years, and who lives near Oakley, called on us this morning to apologize for not being able to finish some needlework. She told us that she had a sick child, and also a little girl of three, in her house. She said she had found the child, in ragged gypsy garments, fainting in a field. She took her into her house, and on undressing her, found that she was no true gypsy, but that her face and hands and arms had been dyed; she said the little one had been treated in a similar manner. Jane's suspicions and mine were instantly roused, and we went back with the woman to Oakley, and found, as we had anticipated, that the children were little Nan and Annie. The sad thing is that Annie is in high fever, and knows no one. We waited there until the doctor arrived, who spoke very, very seriously of her case. Little Nan is well, and asked for you.\"  With these last words Miss Agnes Bruce softly left the room closing the door after her.  \"Now, Susan,\" said Hester, without an instant's pause; \"come, let us tell Mr. Everard of our wickedness. Oh, sir,\" she added, raising her eyes to the clergyman's face, \"if Annie dies I shall go mad. Oh, I cannot, cannot bear life if Annie dies!\"  \"Tell me what is wrong, my poor child,\" said Mr. Everard. He laid his hand on her shoulder, and gradually and skillfully drew from the agitated and miserable girl the story of her sin, of her cowardice, and of her deep, though until now unavailing repentance. How from the first she had hated and disliked Annie; how unjustly she had felt toward her; how she had longed and hoped Annie was guilty; and how, when at last the clue was put into her hands to prove Annie's absolute innocence, she had determined not to use it.  \"From the day Nan was lost,\" continued Hester, \"it has been all agony and all repentance; but, oh, I was too proud to tell! I was too proud to humble myself to the very dust!\"  \"But not now,\" said the clergyman, very gently.  \"No, no; not now. I care for nothing now in all the world except that Annie may live.\"  \"You don't mind the fact that Mrs. Willis and all your schoolfellows must know of this, and must--must judge you accordingly?\"  \"They can't think worse of me than I think of myself. I only want Annie to live.\"  \"No, Hester,\" answered Mr. Everard, \"you want more than that--you want far more than that. It may be that God will take Annie Forest away. We cannot tell. With Him alone are the issues of life or death. What you really want, my child, is the forgiveness of the little girl you have wronged, and the forgiveness of your Father in heaven.\"  Hester began to sob wildly.  \"If--if she dies--may I see her first?\" she gasped.  \"Yes; I will try and promise you that. Now, will you go to your room? I must speak to Miss Drummond alone; she is a far worse culprit than you.\"  Mr. Everard opened the door for Hester, who went silently out.  \"Meet me in the chapel to-night,\" he whispered low in her ear, \"I will talk with you and pray with you there.\"  He closed the door, and came back to Susan.  All throughout this interview his manner had been very gentle to Hester: but the clergyman could be stern, and there was a gleam of very righteous anger in his eyes as he turned to the sullen girl who leaned heavily against the table.  \"This narrative of Hester Thornton's is, of course, quite true, Miss Drummond?\"  \"Oh, yes; there seems to be no use in denying that,\" said Susan.  \"I must insist on your telling me the exact story of your sin. There is no use in your attempting to deny anything; only the utmost candor on your part can now save you from being publicly expelled.\"  \"I am willing to tell,\" answered Susan. \"I meant no harm; it was done as a bit of fun. I had a cousin at home who was very clever at drawing caricatures, and I happened to have nothing to do one day, and I was alone in Annie's bedroom, and I thought I'd like to see what she kept in her desk. I always had a fancy for collecting odd keys, and I found one on my bunch which fitted her desk exactly. I opened it, and I found such a smart little caricature of Mrs. Willis. I sent the caricature to my cousin, and begged of her to make an exact copy of it. She did so, and I put Annie's back in her desk, and pasted the other into Cecil's book. I didn't like Dora Russell, and I wrapped up the sweeties in her theme; but I did the other for pure fun, for I knew Cecil would be so shocked; but I never guessed the blame would fall on Annie. When I found it did, I felt inclined to tell once or twice, but it seemed too much trouble and, besides, I knew Mrs. Willis would punish me, and, of course, I didn't wish that.  \"Dora Russell was always very nasty to me, and when I found she was putting on such airs, and pretending she could write such a grand essay for the prize, I thought I'd take down her pride a bit. I went to her desk, and I got some of the rough copy of the thing she was calling 'The River,' and I sent it off to my cousin, and my cousin made up such a ridiculous paper, and she hit off Dora's writing to the life, and, of course, I had to put it into Dora's desk and tear up her real copy. It was very unlucky Hester being in the room. Of course I never guessed that, or I wouldn't have gone. That was the night we all went with Annie to the fairies' field. I never meant to get Hester into a scrape, nor Annie either, for that matter; but, of course, I couldn't be expected to tell on myself.\"  Susan related her story in her usual monotonous and sing-song voice. There was no trace of apparent emotion on her face, or of regret in her tones. When she had finished speaking Mr. Everard was absolutely silent.  \"I took a great deal of trouble,\" continued Susan, after a pause, in a slightly fretful key. \"It was really nothing but a joke, and I don't see why such a fuss should have been made. I know I lost a great deal of sleep trying to manage that twine business round my foot. I don't think I shall trouble myself playing any more tricks upon schoolgirls--they are not worth it.\"  \"You'll never play any more tricks on these girls,\" said Mr. Everard, rising to his feet, and suddenly filling the room and reducing Susan to an abject silence by the ring of his stern, deep voice. \"I take it upon me, in the absence of your mistress, to pronounce your punishment. You leave Lavender House in disgrace this evening. Miss Good will take you home, and explain to your parents the cause of your dismissal. You are not to see _any_ of your schoolfellows again. Your meanness, your cowardice, your sin require no words on my part to deepen their vileness. Through pure wantonness you have cast a cruel shadow on an innocent young life. If that girl dies, you indeed are not blameless in the cause of her early removal, for through you her heart and spirit were broken. Miss Drummond, I pray God you may at least repent and be sorry. There are some people mentioned in the Bible who are spoken of as past feeling. Wretched girl, while there is yet time, pray that you may not belong to them. Now I must leave you, but I shall lock you in. Miss Good will come for you in about an hour to take you away.\"  Susan Drummond sank down on the nearest seat, and began to cry softly; one or two pin-pricks from Mr. Everard's stern words may possibly have reached her shallow heart--no one can tell. She left Lavender House that evening, and none of the girls who had lived with her as their schoolmate heard of her again.     CHAPTER L.  THE HEART OF LITTLE NAN.   For several days now Annie had lain unconscious in Mrs. Williams' little bedroom; the kind-hearted woman could not find it in her heart to send the sick child away. Her husband and the neighbors expostulated with her, and said that Annie was only a poor little waif.  \"She has no call on you,\" said Jane Allen, a hard-featured woman who lived next door. \"Why should you put yourself out just for a sick lass? and she'll be much better off in the workhouse infirmary.\"  But Mrs. Williams shook her head at her hard-featured and hard-hearted neighbor, and resisted her husband's entreaties.  \"Eh!\" she said, \"but the poor lamb needs a good bit of mothering, and I misdoubt me she wouldn't get much of that in the infirmary.\"  So Annie stayed, and tossed from side to side of her little bed, and murmured unintelligible words, and grew daily a little weaker and a little more delirious. The parish doctor called, and shook his head over her; he was not a particularly clever man, but he was the best the Williamses could afford. While Annie suffered and went deeper into that valley of humiliation and weakness which leads to the gate of the Valley of the Shadow of Death, little Nan played with Peggy Williams, and accustomed herself after the fashion of little children to all the ways of her new and humble home.  It was on the eighth day of Annie's fever that the Misses Bruce discovered her, and on the evening of that day Mrs. Willis knelt by her little favorite's bed. A better doctor had been called in, and all that money could procure had been got now for poor Annie; but the second doctor considered her case even more critical, and said that the close air of the cottage was much against her recovery.  \"I didn't make that caricature; I took the girls into the fairies' field, but I never pasted that caricature into Cecil's book. I know you don't believe me, Cecil; but do you think I would really do anything so mean about one whom love? No, No! I am innocent! God knows it. Yes, I am glad of that--God knows it.\"  Over and over in Mrs. Willis' presence these piteous words would come from the fever-stricken child, but always when she came to the little sentence \"God knows I am innocent,\" her voice would grow tranquil, and a faint and sweet smile would play round her lips.  Late that night a carriage drew up at a little distance from the cottage, and a moment or two afterward Mrs. Willis was called out of the room to speak to Cecil Temple.  \"I have found out the truth about Annie; I have come at once to tell you,\" she said; and then she repeated the substance of Hester's and Susan's story.  \"God help me for having misjudged her,\" murmured the head-mistress; then she bade Cecil \"good-night\" and returned to the sick-room.  The next time Annie broke out with her piteous wail, \"They believe me guilty--Mrs. Willis does--they all do,\" the mistress laid her hand with a firm and gentle pressure on the child's arm.  \"Not now, my dear,\" she said, in a slow, clear, and emphatic voice. \"God has shown your governess the truth, and she believes in you.\"  The very carefully-uttered words pierced through the clouded brain; for a moment Annie lay quite still, with her bright and lovely eyes fixed on her teacher.  \"Is that really you?\" she asked.  \"I am here, my darling.\"  \"And you believe in me?\"  \"I do, most absolutely.\"  \"God does, too, you know,\" answered Annie--bringing out the words quickly, and turning her head to the other side. The fever had once more gained supremacy, and she rambled on unceasingly through the dreary night.  Now, however, when the passionate words broke out, \"They believe me guilty,\" Mrs. Willis always managed to quiet her by saying, \"I know you are innocent.\"  The next day at noon those girls who had not gone home--for many had started by the morning train--were wandering aimlessly about the grounds.  Mr. Everard had gone to see Annie, and had promised to bring back the latest tidings about her.  Hester, holding little Nan's hand--for she could scarcely bear to have her recovered treasure out of sight--had wandered away from the rest of her companions, and had seated herself with Nan under a large oak-tree which grew close to the entrance of the avenue. She had come here in order to be the very first to see Mr. Everard on his return. Nan had climbed into Hester's lap, and Hester had buried her aching head in little Nan's bright curls, when she started suddenly to her feet and ran forward. Her quick ears had detected the sound of wheels.  How soon Mr. Everard had returned; surely the news was bad! She flew to the gate, and held it open in order to avoid the short delay which the lodge-keeper might cause in coming to unfasten it. She flushed, however, vividly, and felt half inclined to retreat into the shade, when she saw that the gentleman who was approaching was not Mr. Everard, but a tall, handsome, and foreign-looking man, who drove a light dog-cart himself. The moment he saw Hester with little Nan clinging to her skirts he stopped short.  \"Is this Lavender House, little girl?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" replied Hester.  \"And can you tell me--but of course you know--you are one of the young ladies who live here, eh?\"  Hester nodded.  \"Then you can tell me if Mrs. Willis is at home--but of course she is.\"  \"No, sir,\" answered Hester; \"I am sorry to tell you that Mrs. Willis is away. She has been called away on very, very sad business; she won't come back to-night.\"  Something in Hester's tone caused the stranger to look at her attentively; he jumped off the dog-cart and came to her side.  \"See here, Miss----\"  \"Thornton,\" put in Hester.  \"Yes, Miss--Miss Thornton, perhaps you can manage for me as well as Mrs. Willis; after all I don't particularly want to see her. If you belong to Lavender House, you, of course, know my--I mean you have a schoolmate here, a little, pretty gypsy rogue called Forest--little Annie Forest. I want to see her--can you take me to her?\"  \"You are her father?\" gasped Hester.  \"Yes, my dear child, I am her father. Now you can take me to her at once.\"  Hester covered her face.  \"Oh, I cannot,\" she said--\"I cannot take you to Annie. Oh, sir, if you knew all, you would feel inclined to kill me. Don't ask me about Annie--don't, don't.\"  The stranger looked fairly non-plussed and not a little alarmed. Just at this moment Nan's tiny fingers touched his hand.  \"Me'll take 'oo to my Annie,\" she said--\"mine poor Annie. Annie's vedy sick, but me'll take 'oo.\"  The tall, foreign-looking man lifted Nan into his arms.  \"Sick, is she?\" he answered. \"Look here young lady,\" he added, turning to Hester, \"whatever you have got to say, I am sure you will try and say it; you will pity a father's anxiety and master your own feelings. Where _is_ my little girl?\"  Hester hastily dried her tears.  \"She is in a cottage near Oakley, sir.\"  \"Indeed! Oakley is some miles from here?\"  \"And she is very ill.\"  \"What of?\"  \"Fever; they--they fear she may die.\"  \"Take me to her,\" said the stranger. \"If she is ill and dying she wants me. Take me to her at once. Here, jump on the dog-cart; and, little one, you shall come too.\"  So furiously did Captain Forest drive that in a very little over an hour's time his panting horse stopped at a few steps from the cottage. He called to a boy to hold him, and, accompanied by Hester, and carrying Nan in his arms, he stood on the threshold of Mrs. Williams' humble little abode. Mr. Everard was coming out.  \"Hester,\" he said, \"you here? I was coming for you.\"  \"Oh, then she is worse?\"  \"She is conscious, and has asked for you. Yes, she is very, very ill.\"  \"Mr. Everard, this gentleman is Annie's father.\"  Mr. Everard looked pityingly at Captain Forest.  \"You have come back at a sad hour, sir,\" he said. \"But no, it cannot harm her to see you. Come with me.\"  Captain Forest went first into the sick-room; Hester waited outside. She had the little kitchen to herself, for all the Williamses, with the exception of the good mother, had moved for the time being to other quarters. Surely Mr. Everard would come for her in a moment? Surely Captain Forest, who had gone into the sick-room with Nan in his arms, would quickly return? There was no sound. All was absolute quiet. How soon would Hester be summoned? Could she--could she bear to look at Annie's dying face? Her agony drove her down on her knees.  \"Oh, if you would only spare Annie!\" she prayed to God. Then she wiped her eyes. This terrible suspense seemed more than she could bear. Suddenly the bedroom door was softly and silently opened, and Mr. Everard came out.  \"She sleeps,\" he said; \"there is a shadow of hope. Little Nan has done it. Nan asked to lie down beside her, and she said, 'Poor Annie! poor Annie!' and stroked her cheek; and in some way, I don't know how, the two have gone to sleep together. Annie did not even glance at her father; she was quite taken up with Nan. You can come to the door and look at her, Hester.\"  Hester did so. A time had been when she could scarcely have borne that sight without a pang of jealousy; now she turned to Mr. Everard:  \"I--I could even give her the heart of little Nan to keep her here,\" she murmured.     CHAPTER LI.  THE PRIZE ESSAY.   Annie did not die. The fever passed away in that long and refreshing sleep, while Nan's cool hand lay against her cheek. She came slowly, slowly back to life--to a fresh, a new, and a glad life. Hester, from being her enemy, was now her dearest and warmest friend. Her father was at home again, and she could no longer think or speak of herself as lonely or sad. She recovered, and in future days reigned as a greater favorite than ever at Lavender House. It is only fair to say that Tiger never went back to the gypsies, but devoted himself first and foremost to Annie, and then to the captain, who pronounced him a capital dog, and when he heard his story vowed he never would part with him.  Owing to Annie's illness, and to all the trouble and confusion which immediately ensued, Mrs. Willis did not give away her prizes at the usual time; but when her scholars once more assembled at Lavender House she astonished several of them by a few words.  \"My dears,\" she said, standing in her accustomed place at the head of the long school-room, \"I intend now before our first day of lessons begins, to distribute those prizes which would have been yours, under ordinary circumstances, on the twenty-first of June. The prizes will be distributed during the afternoon recess; but here, and now, I wish to say something about--and also to give away--the prize for English composition. Six essays, all written with more or less care, have been given to me to inspect. There are reasons which we need not now go into which made it impossible to me to say anything in favor of a theme called 'The River,' written by my late pupil, Miss Russell; but I can cordially praise a very nice historical sketch of Marie Antoinette, the work of Hester Thornton. Mary Price has also written a study which pleases me much, as it shows thought and even a little originality. The remainder of the six essays simply reach an ordinary average. You will be surprised therefore, my dears, to learn that I do not award the prize to any of these themes, but rather to a seventh composition, which was put into my hands yesterday by Miss Danesbury. It is crude and unfinished, and doubtless but for her recent illness would have received many corrections; but these few pages, which are called 'A Lonely Child,' drew tears from my eyes; crude as they are, they have the merit of real originality. They are too morbid to read to you, girls, and I sincerely trust and pray the young writer may never pen anything so sad again. Such as they are, however, they rank first in the order of merit and the prize is hers. Annie, my dear, come forward.\"  Annie left her seat, and, amid the cheers of her companions, went up to Mrs. Willis, who placed a locket, attached to a slender gold chain, round her neck; the locket contained a miniature of the head-mistress' much-loved face.  \"After all, think of our Annie Forest turning out clever as well as being the prettiest and dearest girl in the school!\" exclaimed several of her companions.  \"Only I do wish,\" added one, \"that Mrs. Willis had let us see the essay. Annie, treasure, come here; tell us what the 'Lonely Child' was about.\"  \"I don't remember,\" answered Annie. \"I don't know what loneliness means now, so how can I describe it?\"  THE END  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  A. L. BURT'S PUBLICATIONS For Young People BY POPULAR WRITERS, 97-99-101 Reade Street, New York.  Bonnie Prince Charlie: A Tale of Fontenoy and Culloden. By G. A. HENTY. With 12 full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  The adventures of the son of a Scotch officer in French service. The boy, brought up by a Glasgow bailie, is arrested for aiding a Jacobite agent, escapes, is wrecked on the French coast, reaches Paris, and serves with the French army at Dettingen. He kills his father's foe in a duel, and escaping to the coast, shares the adventures of Prince Charlie, but finally settles happily in Scotland.  \"Ronald, the hero, is very like the hero of 'Quentin Durward.' The lad's journey across France, and his hairbreadth escapes, make up as good a narrative of the kind as we have ever read. For freshness of treatment and variety of incident Mr. Henty has surpassed himself.\"--_Spectator._  With Clive in India; or, the Beginnings of an Empire. By G. A. HENTY. With 12 full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  The period between the landing of Clive as a young writer in India and the close of his career was critical and eventful in the extreme. At its commencement the English were traders existing on sufferance of the native princes. At its close they were masters of Bengal and of the greater part of Southern India. The author has given a full and accurate account of the events of that stirring time, and battles and sieges follow each other in rapid succession, while he combines with his narrative a tale of daring and adventure, which gives a lifelike interest to the volume.  \"He has taken a period of Indian history of the most vital importance, and he has embroidered on the historical facts a story which of itself is deeply interesting. Young people assuredly will be delighted with the volume.\"--_Scotsman._  The Lion of the North: A Tale of Gustavus Adolphus and the Wars of Religion. By G. A. HENTY. With full-page Illustrations by JOHN SCHNBERG. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  In this story Mr. Henty gives the history of the first part of the Thirty Years' War. The issue had its importance, which has extended to the present day, as it established religious freedom in Germany. The army of the chivalrous king of Sweden was largely composed of Scotchmen, and among these was the hero of the story.  \"The tale is a clever and instructive piece of history, and as boys may be trusted to read it conscientiously, they can hardly fail to be profited.\"--_Times._  The Dragon and the Raven; or, The Days of King Alfred. By G. A. HENTY. With full-page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND, R.I. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  In this story the author gives an account of the fierce struggle between Saxon and Dane for supremacy in England, and presents a vivid picture of the misery and ruin to which the country was reduced by the ravages of the sea-wolves. The hero, a young Saxon thane, takes part in all the battles fought by King Alfred. He is driven from his home, takes to the sea and resists the Danes on their own element, and being pursued by them up the Seine, is present at the long and desperate siege of Paris.  \"Treated in a manner most attractive to the boyish reader.\"--_Athenum._  The Young Carthaginian: A Story of the Times of Hannibal. By G. A. HENTY. With full-page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND, R.I. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  Boys reading the history of the Punic Wars have seldom a keen appreciation of the merits of the contest. That it was at first a struggle for empire, and afterward for existence on the part of Carthage, that Hannibal was a great and skillful general, that he defeated the Romans at Trebia, Lake Trasimenus, and Cann, and all but took Rome, represents pretty nearly the sum total of their knowledge. To let them know more about this momentous struggle for the empire of the world Mr. Henty has written this story, which not only gives in graphic style a brilliant description of a most interesting period of history, but is a tale of exciting adventure sure to secure the interest of the reader.  \"Well constructed and vividly told. From first to last nothing stays the interest of the narrative. It bears us along as on a stream whose current varies in direction, but never loses its force.\"--_Saturday Review._  In Freedom's Cause: A Story of Wallace and Bruce. By G. A. HENTY. With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  In this story the author relates the stirring tale of the Scottish War of Independence. The extraordinary valor and personal prowess of Wallace and Bruce rival the deeds of the mythical heroes of chivalry, and indeed at one time Wallace was ranked with these legendary personages. The researches of modern historians have shown, however, that he was a living, breathing man--and a valiant champion. The hero of the tale fought under both Wallace and Bruce, and while the strictest historical accuracy has been maintained with respect to public events, the work is full of \"hairbreadth 'scapes\" and wild adventure.  \"It is written in the author's best style. Full of the wildest and most remarkable achievements, it is a tale of great interest, which a boy, once he has begun it, will not willingly put on one side.\"--_The Schoolmaster._  With Lee in Virginia: A Story of the American Civil War. By G. A. HENTY. With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  The story of a young Virginian planter, who, after bravely proving his sympathy with the slaves of brutal masters, serves with no less courage and enthusiasm under Lee and Jackson through the most exciting events of the struggle. He has many hairbreadth escapes, is several times wounded and twice taken prisoner; but his courage and readiness and, in two cases, the devotion of a black servant and of a runaway slave whom he had assisted, bring him safely through all difficulties.  \"One of the best stories for lads which Mr. Henty has yet written. The picture is full of life and color, and the stirring and romantic incidents are skillfully blended with the personal interest and charm of the story.\"--_Standard._  By England's Aid; or, The Freeing of the Netherlands (1585-1604). By G. A. HENTY. With full-page Illustrations by ALFRED PEARSE, and Maps. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  The story of two English lads who go to Holland as pages in the service of one of \"the fighting Veres.\" After many adventures by sea and land, one of the lads finds himself on board a Spanish ship at the time of the defeat of the Armada, and escapes only to fall into the hands of the Corsairs. He is successful in getting back to Spain under the protection of a wealthy merchant, and regains his native country after the capture of Cadiz.  \"It is an admirable book for youngsters. It overflows with stirring incident and exciting adventure, and the color of the era and of the scene are finely reproduced. The illustrations add to its attractiveness.\"--_Boston Gazette._  By Right of Conquest; or, With Cortez in Mexico. By G. A. HENTY. With full-page Illustrations by W. S. STACEY, and Two Maps. 12mo, cloth, price $1.50.  The conquest of Mexico by a small band of resolute men under the magnificent leadership of Cortez is always rightly ranked among the most romantic and daring exploits in history. With this as the groundwork of his story Mr. Henty has interwoven the adventures of an English youth, Roger Hawkshaw, the sole survivor of the good ship Swan, which had sailed from a Devon port to challenge the mercantile supremacy of the Spaniards in the New World. He is beset by many perils among the natives, but is saved by his own judgment and strength, and by the devotion of an Aztec princess. At last by a ruse he obtains the protection of the Spaniards, and after the fall of Mexico he succeeds in regaining his native shore, with a fortune and a charming Aztec bride.  \"'By Right of Conquest' is the nearest approach to a perfectly successful Historical tale that Mr. Henty has yet published.\"--_Academy._  In the Reign of Terror: The Adventures of a Westminster Boy. By G. A. HENTY. With full-page Illustrations by J. SCHNBERG. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  Harry Sandwith, a Westminster boy, becomes a resident at the chateau of a French marquis, and after various adventures accompanies the family to Paris at the crisis of the Revolution. Imprisonment and death reduce their number, and the hero finds himself beset by perils with the three young daughters of the house in his charge. After hairbreadth escapes they reach Nantes. There the girls are condemned to death in the coffin-ships, but are saved by the unfailing courage of their boy protector.  \"Harry Sandwith, the Westminster boy, may fairly be said to beat Mr. Henty's record. His adventures will delight boys by the audacity and peril they depict.... The story is one of Mr. Henty's best.\"--_Saturday Review._  With Wolfe in Canada; or, The Winning of a Continent. By G. A. HENTY. With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  In the present volume Mr. Henty gives an account of the struggle between Britain and France for supremacy in the North American continent. On the issue of this war depended not only the destinies of North America, but to a large extent those of the mother countries themselves. The fall of Quebec decided that the Anglo-Saxon race should predominate in the New World; that Britain, and not France, should take the lead among the nations of Europe; and that English and American commerce, the English language, and English literature, should spread right round the globe.  \"It is not only a lesson in history as instructively as it is graphically told, but also a deeply interesting and often thrilling tale of adventure and peril by flood and field.\"--_Illustrated London News._  True to the Old Flag: A Tale of the American War of Independence. By G. A. HENTY. With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  In this story the author has gone to the accounts of officers who took part in the conflict, and lads will find that in no war in which American and British soldiers have been engaged did they behave with greater courage and good conduct. The historical portion of the book being accompanied with numerous thrilling adventures with the redskins on the shores of Lake Huron, a story of exciting interest is interwoven with the general narrative and carried through the book.  \"Does justice to the pluck and determination of the British soldiers during the unfortunate struggle against American emancipation. The son of an American loyalist, who remains true to our flag, falls among the hostile redskins in that very Huron country which has been endeared to us by the exploits of Hawkeye and Chingachgook.\"--_The Times._  The Lion of St. Mark: A Tale of Venice in the Fourteenth Century. By G. A. HENTY. With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  A story of Venice at a period when her strength and splendor were put to the severest tests. The hero displays a fine sense and manliness which carry him safely through an atmosphere of intrigue, crime, and bloodshed. He contributes largely to the victories of the Venetians at Porto d'Anzo and Chioggia, and finally wins the hand of the daughter of one of the chief men of Venice.  \"Every boy should read 'The Lion of St. Mark.' Mr. Henty has never produced a story more delightful, more wholesome, or more vivacious.\"--_Saturday Review._  A Final Reckoning: A Tale of Bush Life in Australia. By G. A. HENTY. With full-page Illustrations by W. B. WOLLEN. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  The hero, a young English lad, after rather a stormy boyhood, emigrates to Australia, and gets employment as an officer in the mounted police. A few years of active work on the frontier, where he has many a brush with both natives and bushrangers, gain him promotion to a captaincy, and he eventually settles down to the peaceful life of a squatter.  \"Mr. Henty has never published a more readable, a more carefully constructed, or a better written story than this.\"--_Spectator._  Under Drake's Flag: A Tale of the Spanish Main. By G. A. HENTY. With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  A story of the days when England and Spain struggled for the supremacy of the sea. The heroes sail as lads with Drake in the Pacific expedition, and in his great voyage of circumnavigation. The historical portion of the story is absolutely to be relied upon, but this will perhaps be less attractive than the great variety of exciting adventure through which the young heroes pass in the course of their voyages.  \"A book of adventure, where the hero meets with experience enough, one would think, to turn his hair gray.\"--_Harper's Monthly Magazine._  By Sheer Pluck: A Tale of the Ashanti War. By G. A. HENTY. With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  The author has woven, in a tale of thrilling interest, all the details of the Ashanti campaign, of which he was himself a witness. His hero, after many exciting adventures in the interior, is detained a prisoner by the king just before the outbreak of the war, but escapes, and accompanies the English expedition on their march to Coomassie.  \"Mr. Henty keeps up his reputation as a writer of boys' stories. 'By Sheer Pluck' will be eagerly read.\"--_Athenum._  By Pike and Dyke: A Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic. By G. A. HENTY. With full-page Illustrations by MAYNARD BROWN, and 4 Maps. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  In this story Mr. Henty traces the adventures and brave deeds of an English boy in the household of the ablest man of his age--William the Silent. Edward Martin, the son of an English sea captain, enters the service of the Prince as a volunteer, and is employed by him in many dangerous and responsible missions, in the discharge of which he passes through the great sieges of the time. He ultimately settles down as Sir Edward Martin.  \"Boys with a turn for historical research will be enchanted with the book, while the rest who only care for adventure will be students in spite of themselves.\"--_St. James' Gazette._  St. George for England: A Tale of Cressy and Poitiers. By G. A. HENTY. With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  No portion of English history is more crowded with great events than that of the reign of Edward III. Cressy and Poitiers; the destruction of the Spanish fleet; the plague of the Black Death; the Jacquerie rising; these are treated by the author in \"St. George for England.\" The hero of the story, although of good family, begins life as a London apprentice, but after countless adventures and perils becomes by valor and good conduct the squire, and at last the trusted friend of the Black Prince.  \"Mr. Henty has developed for himself a type of historical novel for boys which bids fair to supplement, on their behalf, the historical labors of Sir Walter Scott in the land of fiction.\"--_The Standard._  Captain's Kidd's Gold: The True Story of an Adventurous Sailor Boy. By JAMES FRANKLIN FITTS. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  There is something fascinating to the average youth in the very idea of buried treasure. A vision arises before his eyes of swarthy Portuguese and Spanish rascals, with black beards and gleaming eyes--sinister-looking fellows who once on a time haunted the Spanish Main, sneaking out from some hidden creek in their long, low schooner, of picaroonish rake and sheer, to attack an unsuspecting trading craft. There were many famous sea rovers in their day, but none more celebrated than Capt. Kidd. Perhaps the most fascinating tale of all is Mr. Fitts' true story of an adventurous American boy, who receives from his dying father an ancient bit of vellum, which the latter obtained in a curious way. The document bears obscure directions purporting to locate a certain island in the Bahama group, and a considerable treasure buried there by two of Kidd's crew. The hero of this book, Paul Jones Garry, is an ambitious, persevering lad, of salt-water New England ancestry, and his efforts to reach the island and secure the money form one of the most absorbing tales for our youth that has come from the press.  Captain Bayley's Heir: A Tale of the Gold Fields of California. By G. A. HENTY. With full-page Illustrations by H. M. PAGET. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  A frank, manly lad and his cousin are rivals in the heirship of a considerable property. The former falls into a trap laid by the latter, and while under a false accusation of theft foolishly leaves England for America. He works his passage before the mast, joins a small band of hunters, crosses a tract of country infested with Indians to the Californian gold diggings, and is successful both as digger and trader.  \"Mr. Henty is careful to mingle instruction with entertainment; and the humorous touches, especially in the sketch of John Holl, the Westminster dustman, Dickens himself could hardly have excelled.\"--_Christian Leader._  For Name and Fame; or, Through Afghan Passes. By G. A. HENTY. With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  An interesting story of the last war in Afghanistan. The hero, after being wrecked and going through many stirring adventures among the Malays, finds his way to Calcutta and enlists in a regiment proceeding to join the army at the Afghan passes. He accompanies the force under General Roberts to the Peiwar Kotal, is wounded, taken prisoner, carried to Cabul, whence he is transferred to Candahar, and takes part in the final defeat of the army of Ayoub Khan.  \"The best feature of the book--apart from the interest of its scenes of adventure--is its honest effort to do justice to the patriotism of the Afghan people.\"--_Daily News._  Captured by Apes: The Wonderful Adventures of a Young Animal Trainer. By HARRY PRENTICE. 12mo, cloth, $1.00.  The scene of this tale is laid on an island in the Malay Archipelago. Philip Garland, a young animal collector and trainer, of New York, sets sail for Eastern seas in quest of a new stock of living curiosities. The vessel is wrecked off the coast of Borneo and young Garland, the sole survivor of the disaster, is cast ashore on a small island, and captured by the apes that overrun the place. The lad discovers that the ruling spirit of the monkey tribe is a gigantic and vicious baboon, whom he identifies as Goliah, an animal at one time in his possession and with whose instruction he had been especially diligent. The brute recognizes him, and with a kind of malignant satisfaction puts his former master through the same course of training he had himself experienced with a faithfulness of detail which shows how astonishing is monkey recollection. Very novel indeed is the way by which the young man escapes death. Mr. Prentice has certainly worked a new vein on juvenile fiction, and the ability with which he handles a difficult subject stamps him as a writer of undoubted skill.  The Bravest of the Brave; or, With Peterborough in Spain. By G. A. HENTY. With full-page Illustrations by H. M. PAGET. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  There are few great leaders whose lives and actions have so completely fallen into oblivion as those of the Earl of Peterborough. This is largely due to the fact that they were overshadowed by the glory and successes of Marlborough. His career as general extended over little more than a year, and yet, in that time, he showed a genius for warfare which has never been surpassed.  \"Mr. Henty never loses sight of the moral purpose of his work--to enforce the doctrine of courage and truth. Lads will read 'The Bravest of the Brave' with pleasure and profit; of that we are quite sure.\"--_Daily Telegraph._  The Cat of Bubastes: A Story of Ancient Egypt. By G. A. HENTY. With full-page Illustrations. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  A story which will give young readers an unsurpassed insight into the customs of the Egyptian people. Amuba, a prince of the Rebu nation, is carried with his charioteer Jethro into slavery. They become inmates of the house of Ameres, the Egyptian high-priest, and are happy in his service until the priest's son accidentally kills the sacred cat of Bubastes. In an outburst of popular fury Ameres is killed, and it rests with Jethro and Amuba to secure the escape of the high-priest's son and daughter.  \"The story, from the critical moment of the killing of the sacred cat to the perilous exodus into Asia with which it closes, is very skillfully constructed and full of exciting adventures. It is admirably illustrated.\"--_Saturday Review._  With Washington at Monmouth: A Story of Three Philadelphia Boys. By JAMES OTIS. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.  Three Philadelphia boys, Seth Graydon \"whose mother conducted a boarding-house which was patronized by the British officers;\" Enoch Ball, \"son of that Mrs. Ball whose dancing school was situated on Letitia Street,\" and little Jacob, son of \"Chris, the Baker,\" serve as the principal characters. The story is laid during the winter when Lord Howe held possession of the city, and the lads aid the cause by assisting the American spies who make regular and frequent visits from Valley Forge. One reads here of home-life in the captive city when bread was scarce among the people of the lower classes, and a reckless prodigality shown by the British officers, who passed the winter in feasting and merry-making while the members of the patriot army but a few miles away were suffering from both cold and hunger. The story abounds with pictures of Colonial life skillfully drawn, and the glimpses of Washington's soldiers which are given show that the work has not been hastily done, or without considerable study. \n\n\n"
